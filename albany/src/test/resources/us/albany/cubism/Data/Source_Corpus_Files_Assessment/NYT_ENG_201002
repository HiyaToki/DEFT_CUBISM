DEGENERES A RISING STAR IN DAYTIME
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executives at Warner Brothers have long believed that Ellen
DeGeneres is the heir apparent to Oprah Winfrey in daytime TV.
Still, they were startled by the news that a media research firm
delivered to them last spring.
</P>
<P>
The researchers from SmithGeiger, who had been hired to assess
the talk show landscape, convened to tell a group of six executives
that "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" was, for the first time, on par
with "The Oprah Winfrey Show" in the minds of viewers. They had
ample reason to conclude that this was DeGeneres' moment.
</P>
<P>
One of the executives stood up, closed the meeting room door,
and said the data must not leave the room -- after all, Winfrey had
not yet decided that her talk show would end in September 2011.
</P>
<P>
But once Winfrey did decide, last November, Warner Brothers put
the research to work, and before long it had brokered a deal,
announcing on Wednesday night that NBC's 10 owned-and-operated
stations would keep broadcasting DeGeneres' show through 2014.
</P>
<P>
The contract extension amounted to the first big bet on the
post-Winfrey landscape, and not necessarily a hard bet for NBC
Universal to make. Viewer studies and ratings trends suggest that
the effervescent DeGeneres is best positioned to break out from the
talk show pack when Winfrey leaves the stage.
</P>
<P>
Why? Because her hour-long show is upbeat and inspirational, two
traits that appeal to daytime's core female audience, according to
the viewer studies, which TV executives rely on as they make
decisions. Equally important, the 52-year-old DeGeneres is seen as
relaxed and relatable. Already, she is seen as more likable than
Winfrey, according to the Q Scores Co., which measures consumer
preferences.
</P>
<P>
DeGeneres' star is rising at a stressful time for broadcast TV,
when ratings and revenue for syndicated talk shows are far slimmer
than they were at Winfrey's peak. No one expects "Ellen" to
literally replace "Oprah" in terms of popularity. But a hit show
in syndication can still be a cash cow for its distributors and
broadcasters; for Winfrey, it remains the cornerstone of a
multibillion-dollar media empire.
</P>
<P>
Now Warner Brothers is positioning DeGeneres as the next
benefactor of the businesses. Already, the host's career moves --
like her decision to be a judge on "American Idol," an enormous
promotional platform -- have seemingly been engineered to enhance
her daytime host identity. (Warner Brothers declined to comment for
this article.)
</P>
<P>
In September 2011, the ABC-owned stations that have shown
"Oprah" for decades in most of the country's biggest cities will
need a replacement in the time slot. "Ellen" was a contender, and
one with perfect timing, as her contracts with the competing NBC
stations were set to expire the very same month. But NBC Universal
apparently proved willing to pay a higher license fee to keep the
show for its station group through 2014.
</P>
<P>
In a viewer study that was shared with local TV stations last
month, Frank N. Magid Associates found that DeGeneres'
seven-year-old show -- which features games, music, jokes and
interviews with celebrities -- has been seen by viewers as
"improving" for several years, more so than any of her
competitors.
</P>
<P>
When the Magid panelists were surveyed about their attitudes
toward daytime hosts, DeGeneres was in a virtual tie with Winfrey,
even though there is a ratings lag, according to Steve Ridge,
president of the media strategy group for Magid.
</P>
<P>
"Ellen already has equity with daytime viewers, which is worth
its weight in gold," he said.
</P>
<P>
Viewer awareness of "Oprah" and "Ellen" is roughly even,
said Henry Schafer, an executive vice president at Q Scores. "The
big difference is, these days, Ellen is a much more likable
personality than Oprah," he said.
</P>
<P>
Winfrey's program, however, creates a much stronger emotional
bond with viewers, perhaps explaining why "Oprah" is still far
and away the No.1 syndicated talk show, albeit one that is waning.
</P>
<P>
"Oprah" averaged 8.4 million viewers a day in the 2005-6 TV
season, and sank to an average of 6.2 million viewers in the
2008-09 season, according to the Nielsen Co., mirroring
industrywide declines. So far this season, "Oprah" has rebounded
significantly, to an average of 6.5 million a day. The No. 2
syndicated talk show, "Dr. Phil," has had even steeper declines.
"Ellen" is No.3, and has demonstrated growth, with an average of
3.1 million viewers a day this season, up from around 2.7 million
for each of the last four years, according to Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
TV executives are sensitive about comparisons of the two women,
and there is ample evidence that the hosts are friendly with each
other; DeGeneres was the third person . Winfrey called with her
show-ending news last November. Winfrey will concentrate on her new
cable channel, OWN, which will make its debut in January 2011.
</P>
<P>
OWN, in fact, was engaged in serious negotiations to bring "The
Ellen DeGeneres Show" to cable, but NBC won out, according to two
people with knowledge of the talks who requested anonymity because
they were not authorized to comment.
</P>
<P>
Warner Brothers will now turn its attention to the other
"Ellen" contracts with local stations, most of which expire in
2012. It will most likely push for "Ellen" to be placed in the
prime-time slots that "Oprah" occupies, if not on the same
stations.

PAYTON ' S PATH WAS WINDING, HIS CONFIDENCE NEVER WAVERING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the bulk of attention after the
New Orleans Saints' Super Bowl victory over the Indianapolis Colts
focused on quarterback Drew Brees and cornerback Tracy Porter -- two
Saints with improbable journeys whose career performances came in
the most important game either had ever played -- the path of Sean
Payton was just as, if not more, unlikely.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, it was Payton, the coach once stripped of his
play-calling duties while he was the Giants' offensive coordinator,
whose game plan kept the ball away from quarterback Peyton Manning
and the Colts' productive offense. On Sunday, it was Payton, not
Peyton, whose team produced 31 of the final 38 points, matching the
biggest deficit overcome in Super Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
For this, Payton joined one of the most exclusive clubs in
sports. Only 28 men belong. Each coached a team to a Super Bowl
championship. Payton became the latest to grab hold of the Lombardi
Trophy -- he said he slept with it -- and he may have been the first
to drool on it.
</P>
<P>
Stranger still is one subset of that list that Payton also
joined, members of the same fraternity who once served as Giants'
coordinators: Vince Lombardi, Tom Landry, Bill Belichick and Bill
Parcells, a Mount Rushmore of NFL coaches.
</P>
<P>
It was with the Giants in 2002 that Payton failed, when
differences in philosophy led coach Jim Fassel to remove Payton's
play-calling responsibilities. This did little to dent the
confidence of Payton.
</P>
<P>
After Payton was hired by the Saints in 2006, he stood in front
of his team before the season. He said many of their stories
mirrored his, that their locker room was full of the unwanted and
underrated, the unlikely and unloved. He told the Saints they would
contend for a championship and they insisted that they believed
him.
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't care what anybody thinks," running back Mike Bell
said. "He's all man."
</P>
<P>
Payton is a coach cut from the Parcells cloth, and in the coach
called Big Tuna, he found a mentor, an ally and a confidant. After
Payton left the Giants after the 2002 season, he and Parcells met
on the private plane of Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys' owner. For
two and a half hours, they talked about football and passion and
drew plays on napkins until their supply ran out.
</P>
<P>
For three years, from 2003 and to 2005, Payton was Parcells'
quarterbacks coach and then assistant head coach and said each day,
he took something from Parcells. When Mickey Loomis, the Saints'
general manager, was searching for a coach in 2006 "with a
pedigree from a really disciplined, tough-minded mentor," he found
Payton, an unlikely choice but one who fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
Thus Payton's itinerant path continued. He had played
quarterback at Naperville Central High School near Chicago. He
played in college at Eastern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
In one season, 1987, he played in the Arena Football League, the
Canadian Football League and the NFL. That was as a replacement
player, for three games with the Chicago Bears, in which Payton
produced these numbers: 8 of 23, 79 yards, one interception.
</P>
<P>
Payton even played for the Leicester Panthers in the British
League, an experience he compared to the novel, "Playing for
Pizza," written by John Grisham. It was there, Payton said, where
he began contemplating becoming a coach.
</P>
<P>
So Payton crisscrossed the country, working at San Diego State
and Indiana State and Miami of Ohio and Illinois. His first NFL
coaching job came with Philadelphia, 10 seasons after he started.
Eventually, Payton helped find Tony Romo, now the Cowboys' Pro Bowl
quarterback. Eventually, he developed a reputation as an offensive
guru, a master of the mismatch.
</P>
<P>
Payton arrived in New Orleans the same season as Brees, and in
the past four years, they have produced the NFL's top-ranked
offense three times. This season, Brees set a league completion
record, and together they delivered the first Super Bowl in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
"Sean believed in me when nobody else did," Brees said. "My
first year here was his first year. It was like a new chapter in
both our lives. I wouldn't want to play for anyone else. I get a
proud feeling when I think of the road he has traveled."
</P>
<P>
Payton saved some of his best work for halftime of the Super
Bowl, when he declared the Saints would run a play called Ambush to
start the second half. This was classic Payton, confidence
unwavering, gambling once again.
</P>
<P>
All of his experiences -- the travel and the failure and
apprenticeships -- went into that decision. Payton told his players
he planned to win, and by calling Ambush, an onside kick, to begin
the third quarter, he demonstrated what he meant. The Saints
recovered the kick, after a series of odd bounces, and another
Payton gamble had succeeded.
</P>
<P>
It changed the game. The Saints drew from their coach's swagger.
The Colts never recovered. "Gutsy" is how the Saints described
their coach.
</P>
<P>
They pointed to last off-season, when Payton offered to
personally pay $250,000 to land the defensive coordinator Gregg
Williams, the man who changed his defense into a swarming,
turnover-producing machine. They noted Payton's play-calling, the
way perception had now shifted.
</P>
<P>
Payton climbed atop the podium with his prized possession
already in his arms. He held that Lombardi Trophy tightly and kept
holding it through the night.

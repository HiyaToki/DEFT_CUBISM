"He was a selfless public servant who fought for the rights of all Americans and
sought to help people in developing countries across the globe," it said.

Japan PM, main rival clash in pre-election debate

TOKYO, Aug 12, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's embattled Prime Minister Taro Aso in a pre-election debate Wednesday
sought to claw away at his rival's strong lead by promising to rebuild the
recession-hit economy and ensure national security.
</P>
<P>
Opposition candidate Yukio Hatoyama pledged sweeping government reforms, better
social security and a foreign policy focused more on humanitarian aid than
military means.
</P>
<P>
The two candidates -- both career politicians from powerful political dynasties
-- clashed in their first face-to-face debate since Aso last month called the
election widely expected to change Japan's political landscape.
</P>
<P>
If the polls are correct, Hatoyama is likely to unseat Aso in the August 30 vote
and end the ruling conservative party's almost unbroken half-century grip on
political power.
</P>
<P>
Japan's electorate has long been risk-averse, and a large proportion of
undecided voters suggests that both Aso and Hatoyama have yet to energise swing
voters with their policy pledges for the world's number two economy.
</P>
<P>
In their battle for Japan's hearts and minds, amid the country's worst post-war
recession, Aso has promised stability and continuity while Hatoyama has vowed to
end the business-as-usual style of Japanese politics.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama -- whose centre-left Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) has pledged to
build a more caring society in the capitalist powerhouse economy -- pledged to
boost "household incomes first so that the economy will grow."
</P>
<P>
The DPJ chief, who has promised not to raise taxes, attacked Aso's party for
driving up debt and charged that "anyone can run the government if governing
means borrowing money and asking people to pay more taxes."
</P>
<P>
Aso said his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) would take steps to "expand the size
of the economy first to realise a recovery. That's the difference."
</P>
<P>
"The DPJ's set of policies doesn't have a growth strategy," Aso said in a debate
hosted by a private think-tank, stressing that the opposition's election
promises are fiscally irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
On the security front, Aso attacked Hatoyama's party for earlier opposing
legislation to enable Japan to search North Korean ships as part of UN sanctions
against Pyongyang for its nuclear weapons programme.
</P>
<P>
"It is the North Koreans who are most delighted at this move," Aso said.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama denied that his party had planned to block the move and said "we
understand that we need to take a hard line against North Korea."
</P>
<P>
Aso also lambasted Hatoyama for changing his stance on a naval mission
supporting US-led operations in Afghanistan. The DPJ leader has backed off a
pledge to end it immediately, saying he would scrap it only in January.
</P>
<P>
The DPJ, highlighting Japan's pacifist constitution, has long argued Japan
should not take part in "American wars" and instead focus on humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there are other ways that Japan can contribute to Afghanistan that
President (Hamid) Karzai will be grateful for," Hatoyama said.

Georgia accuses Russia of making 'undisguised threat'

Tbilisi, Aug 1, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tbilisi on Saturday accused Russia of having made an "undisguised threat" and of
having "dangerous designs" on Georgia after Moscow warned that it reserved the
right to use military force in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian defence ministry's expression of its readiness 'to use all
available force and means' against Georgia is an undisguised threat," the
Georgian foreign ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry of foreign affairs of Georgia expresses deep concern and condemns
in the most categorical terms the Russian side's militarist statements, which
aim at further destabilising the situation and causing the unfolding of a
dangerous scenario of events," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The military rhetoric unleashed recently by the Russian defence ministry and a
number of top military officials shed ample light on Russia's dangerous designs
against Georgia," it said.
</P>
<P>
Russia on Saturday warned Georgia its military reserves the right to use force
if the ex-Soviet state continues "provocations" in the Caucasus, one week ahead
of the first anniversary of their 2008 war.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defence ministry accused Georgia of firing several times with
mortars and grenades over the last four days on the capital of its rebel South
Ossetia region which is recognised as independent by Russia.
</P>
<P>
"If such provocations posing a threat to the population of South Ossetia and the
Russian military continue, the defence ministry reserves the right to use all
the forces and means at its disposal," the ministry said in a statement on its
website.

Georgia slams 'immoral' Moscow visit to rebel region
</HEADLINE>

TBILISI, Aug 31, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Georgia said Monday that a visit by the mayor of Moscow to its rebel South
Ossetia region was "immoral" and criticised the opening of a new settlement in
the province named after the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov was visiting South Ossetia to inaugurate a new suburb
-- dubbed the Moskovsky district -- outside the region's main city, Tskhinvali.
</P>
<P>
Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister David Jalagania said Luzhkov's visit was in
violation of international law and that the new suburb had been built on the
ruins of an ethnic Georgian village, Tamarasheni, whose residents fled the
region during last year's war over South Ossetia.
</P>
<P>
"The conduction of such a ceremony together with the Tskhinvali criminal regime
is absolutely immoral... and even the Nazis did not think of building a
settlement and naming it Berlin," Jalagania told journalists in Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov, whose government has pledged millions of dollars in aid to South
Ossetia, praised the new settlement as part of efforts to rebuild the heavily
damaged breakaway region.
</P>
<P>
"We can give housing to needy people, who have lost their fathers, sons and
defenders, who defended the country from the aggressor. The Moskovsky district
has civilised modern infrastructure, heating, water and everything that is
necessary," the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying at the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent tanks and troops into Georgia in August 2008 to repel a Georgian
military attempt to retake South Ossetia, which had received extensive backing
from Moscow for years. Russian troops mostly withdrew within South Ossetia and
another rebel Georgian region, Abkhazia, after Moscow recognised both provinces
as independent states.
</P>
<P>
Russia has kept thousands of troops and pumped millions of dollars into the
regions, drawing repeated protests from Tbilisi.

Mother of British soldier killed in Afghanistan slams govt
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, Aug 18, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mother of the 200th British soldier to be killed in Afghanistan urged
Tuesday all lawmakers to "get out on the front line" to see how desperate troops
were for resources.
</P>
<P>
Hazel Hunt, whose 21-year-old son died from bomb blast injuries on Saturday,
said politicians have "short changed" the army fighting in Afghanistan and the
"troops are suffering because of it."
</P>
<P>
"They should get off their backsides and go and see what it's like for our boys
out there. The Army has been short-changed and the troops are suffering because
of it," she was quoted in British newspapers as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But the politicians are not listening to the troops on the ground - they
haven't got a clue what it's really like. They've got to find more resources,
better equipment and make sure there's enough of it."
</P>
<P>
Amid a surge in violence, Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government has faced
growing calls either to pull troops out of Afghanistan altogether or provide
stronger support.
</P>
<P>
Private Richard Hunt became the 200th British soldier to die since 2001 in the
fight against Taliban insurgents -- a grim milestone that revived questions
about the purpose and resourcing of the mission.
</P>
<P>
Hazel Hunt singled out Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth, who was appointed to the
job in a cabinet reshuffle in June, saying his handling of the issue has been
"stupid and arrogant."
</P>
<P>
"Bob Ainsworth has made some very silly comments in the past few days and he has
only been in the job for five minutes. I think he is speaking too soon and out
of turn. He has been stupid and arrogant," she told the Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
Four more soldiers were killed on the weekend ahead of Afghanistan's
presidential elections on Thursday, taking the British death toll to 204.
</P>
<P>
New figures out Monday highlighted the escalation of violence British troops
face in Afghanistan -- 94 soldiers were wounded last month, just over double the
figure for June.
</P>
<P>
British troop levels in Afghanistan are at their highest yet -- 9,150, up from
8,300 in April. Overall, there are more than 100,000 international soldiers in
Afghanistan, nearly two-thirds of them American.

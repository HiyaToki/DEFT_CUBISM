Anyway, after all that ranting about Marisa Tomei (who after the fact that Darren Aronofosky directs the Wrestler, was my other motivation to see the film), I finally got to see it this weekend.  The film shows very little of Darren Aronofsky's typical filming techniques from Requiem For A Dream and Pi: apart from the camera following the back of the head of the actors (and even then, he didn't seem to use his technique of attaching the camera to the actor as he did in his two first films).  Clint Mansell's score really adds to the film and that last scene is where his music really enhances those emotions.  The story is really touching and there's some great acting from both Rourke and Tomei, mainly because Randy the Ram's story is not too dissimilar to his own but the story may have lacked a tiny bit of substance. In any case, it probably remains one of the best films of the year simply due to a great, original story, a fantastic music score and soundtrack and some quality cinematography.

Becker was the no.1 go to guy for the afl-cio and for the seiu.  last year the following occurred;  Obama Bypasses Senate; Appoints Becker to NLRB Submitted by Carl Horowitz on Sun, 03/28/2010 - 22:05 Email to friendEmail to friendPrinter-friendlyPrinter-friendly  NLRB's Peter Schaumber and Wilma LiebmanBarack Obama and organized labor have made no secret about promoting each other's interests. Indeed, his 2008 presidential victory would have been much more difficult in absence of union financial contributions and volunteer work. Thus, Obama's recess appointment Saturday of Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board, effectively overriding a Senate Republican filibuster last month, served as a political IOU as well as an expression of the president's will. Becker, currently a top union lawyer, has argued that workers should not have any right to opt out of union representation. Moreover, he's counseled a large local union founded as a subsidiary of the corrupt and soon-to-be-extinct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). Becker was one of 15 White House Easter recess appointments that included a less controversial NLRB nominee, Mark Pearce, who, like Becker, is a Democrat.  The five-member NLRB, established 75 years ago by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), is required to have a 3-to-2 Democrat-Republican (or vice versa) mix. And with three vacancies, Obama knows he has a rare opportunity to remake labor law through union-friendly tiebreaker rulings. The two current members are Peter Schaumber (Republican) and Wilma Liebman (Democrat) -- see photo. The three nominees, Craig Becker, Mark Pearce and Brian Hayes, already have been approved by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Hayes, a staffer for Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., apparently will have to go through a standard full-floor Senate vote.  <a href="http://nlpc.org/stories/2010/03/28/obama-bypasses-senate-appoints-becker-nlrb">Obama Bypasses Senate; Appoints Becker to NLRB | National Legal and Policy Center</a>  what counts is how they respond, frankly, I don't think the board has a leg to stand on as in stopping Boeing from building pretty much wherever they want.  Further Boeing has actually increased their union labor foot print in Washington state over the last few years. They, mgt. tried to work a deal with them, they demanded a seat on the board among other things, Boeing said hell no.	Trajan	stopping	 false

Boeing	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8904655	Oh lets be a little trueful guys. The south is not full of qualified workers and they are using the downturn in the economy to attract good paying jobs to a low paying area and give them little of anything other than a place to show up and do what they are told for the amount that the company want to give them.  But the truth is 15 years down the line we will see that people will want more things than just a job and all of a sudden these companies will move again. When they see a company that is making billions and paying top exc's 100 to 500 times the workers will start to look around and say why are we worth crap, living like dogs with no benefits. But lets tell the truth about how this factory was built, because most likely the state gave big incentives for them to build, low taxes and cheap property.  But can one of you idiots that wants a company to pay less and screw their workers while they pad their coffers tell us that what this new company will do will cause any tax payer or any citizen who might fly in any plane they make to pay less.  It's a lot like Nike and their 10 cents an hr labor producing tennis shoes that have a cost from production to sold of like 22.00 being sold for 122.00 a pair. Sure cut the cost of those shoes didn't it. Kinda like the TV's that used to be made in USA by good american workers are now made in sweat shops overseas and sold for 1000.00 when the cost of labor and parts is around 100.00 maybe.  Isn't it a little funny why the price of a loaf of bread or a gal of milk or a gal of gas cost just as much in a non union state as it does in a union state. Why aren't cars that are made by workers who make half as much with little benefits cost the same as it did when it was made in by Unions.	mnbasketball	screw	 false

(For stupid libs, thats akin to USSR, which to also add, is bad).  The Obama Admin has now filed a lawsuit against Boeing. Why? Boeing was tired of dealing with unions in Seattle. So, they took their new Dreamliner production planet, and built it in non-union North Charleston, South Caroline, bringing 5,000-8,000 good paying jobs to the area. The planet in SC is almost finished, with work about to start.  Now Tyrant Obama has filed a federal lawsuit claiming, get this, DISCRIMINATION!!!! They say Boeing is discriminating against union workers.....by daring build a plant in non-union South Carolina. Our federal government is trying to force a private company to use their preferred labor pool. The lawsuit seeks to force Boeing to relocate that new plant in SC back to Seattle.  Never in my wildest imagination could I have thought the United States government would begin filing lawsuits to force a private company to locate it's operations in the politicially preferred choice of the US government. It's basically a political assault on right wing South Carolina. Tyrant tactics, no doubt about it. Chicago thuggery in plain sight.  So now, even if Boeing wins that lawsuit, which they will, Boeing is gonna have to shell out millions of dollars to defend this suit.  Is this how Obama's Admin is gonna do business? SUE companies that provide jobs....for daring not use union labor? Punish states that voted against him with lawsuits against any non-union company within it's borders?

That said from a pure $$$$$$$ viewpoint when the bottomline is calculated say 5 - 7 years from now it will be obvious that the SC plant is sooooo very much less productive than the WA facility in producing the 787 that those union wages will be seen as a bargain. If the company execs were not taking the union boss vs ceo headbutting so personal &amp; just looked at business they would already recognise that the current non-union parts plant they have near the new site is a huge white-elephant and a major drain on profits.

He caused the economy to go into free fall; he caused all the unemployment as a result; he bailed out the banks and GM. But wait! Banks good, now. Wall Street not Main Street more important now. He caused the BP oil spill, remember? Oh wait, no he didn't, he just didn't give a shit. But wait. Then he did give a shit but was told to just shut up and drill baby drill, and pay victims out of his own pocket, not force BP to pay up. He tried to close the gap in health care for Americans, to which the Stupid Brigade said "Over our dead bodies..." (Um, that was the point, folks.)  See how it goes?  </quote>  You are one of the most ignorant people on this board. Obama did a recess appointment of Craig Becker to the NLRB for a reason.  Mr. Becker is one of two recent National Labor Relations Board appointments by President Obama. The five-member NLRB supervises union elections, investigates labor practices and, most important, issues rulings that interpret the National Labor Relations Act. Mr. Becker, who is currently the associate general counsel at Andy Stern's Service Employees International Union, is all for giving unions more power over companies in elections. Only he's not sure he needs to wait for Congress.  ...  Mr. Becker has other ideas. In a 1993 Minnesota Law Review article, written when he was a UCLA professor, he explained that traditional notions of democracy should not apply in union elections. He wrote that employers should be barred from attending NLRB hearings about elections, and from challenging election results even amid evidence of union misconduct. He believes elections should be removed from work sites and held on "neutral grounds," or via mail ballots. Employers should also be barred from "placing observers at the polls to challenge ballots."  More extraordinary, Mr. Becker advocated a new "body of campaign rules" that would severely limit the ability of employers to argue against unionization. He argued that any meeting a company holds that involves a "captive audience" ought to be grounds for overturning an election. If a company wants to distribute leaflets that oppose the union, for example, Mr. Becker said it must allow union access to its private property to do the same.	boedicca	If	 false

Boeing	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8904655	The NLRA, as enacted in 1935, defined and prohibited five unfair labor practices. These prohibitions still exist, while others have been added under later legislation. The original employer unfair labor practices consisted of: Interfering with, restraining or coercing employees in their rights under Section 7. These rights include freedom of association, mutual aid or protection, self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively for wages and working conditions through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other protected concerted activities with or without a union. Section 8(a)(1) "Dominating" or interfering with the formation or administration of any labor organization. Section 8(a)(2) Discriminating against employees to encourage or discourage acts of support for a labor organization. 8(a)(3) Discriminating against employees who file charges or testify. 8(a)(4) Refusing to bargain collectively with the representative of the employer's employees. 8(a)(5) The key principles of the NLRA are embodied in its concluding paragraph of section 1 including: encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection. The key principles also include: Protecting a wide range of activities, whether a union is involved or not, in order to promote organization and collective bargaining. Protecting employees as a class and expressly not on the basis of a relationship with an employer. Sections 2(5) and 2(9). link: Ellen Dannin, Not a Limited, Confined, or Private Matter: Who is an Employee under the National Labor Relations Act <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1115434">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1115434</a> There can be only one exclusive bargaining representative for a unit of employees.

They are retaliating against the 2008 labor strikes.  </quote>  No, they are not.  They want to build a new plant in another state and create 3,800 new jobs.  The Union wants Boeing to promise that ALL JOBS will be located in WA.  In 2009 Boeing announced plans to build a new plant to meet demand for its new 787 Dreamliner. Though its union contract didn't require it, Boeing executives negotiated with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to build the plane at its existing plant in Washington state. The talks broke down because the union wanted, among other things, a seat on Boeing's board and a promise that Boeing would build all future airplanes in Puget Sound.  ...  Boeing says it will challenge the complaint in an NLRB hearing in June, but Big Labor also has sway at the five-member board. Recall that President Obama gave a recess appointment last year to Craig Becker, a former lawyer for the Service Employees International Union who once wrote that the NLRB could impose "card check" rules for union organizing even without an act of Congress. Even a Democratic Senate refused to confirm him.  Beyond labor politics, the NLRB's ruling would set a terrible precedent for the flow of jobs and investment within the U.S. It would essentially give labor a veto over management decisions about where to build future plants. And it would undercut the right-to-work statutes in 22 American states—which is no doubt the main union goal here.  With a Republican House, Mr. Obama's union agenda is dead in Congress. But it looks like his appointees are determined to impose it by regulatory fiat—no matter the damage to investment and job creation.  <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704570704576275351993875640.html?mod=rss_opinion_main">Review &amp; Outlook: The Death of Right to Work - WSJ.com</a>  The Obamanoids are abusing the power of the government in order to benefit their union cronies.	boedicca	promise	 false

Germany	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-212-191668-3060452	Found an interesting article about quality of life. Read it <a href="http://www.economist.com/theworldin/international/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3372495&amp;d=2005">here</a>.  Looks like they've come to the same conclusion as I did. Money isn't everything. Social and cultural structures is also very important units. Interesting to see that they rate both France and Germany ahead of UK in QoL.  <a href="http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf">Here's</a> the methodology.  Can't remember who said it but "social science isn't rocket science, it's much more complex. Anyone can calculate a trajectory in a vacuum".  <quote> Why Irish eyes are smiling  Where will be the best place to live in 2005? The World in 2005 turned to the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has devised a 2005 quality of life index for 111 countries. Result: Ireland comfortably tops the league. America, though the second-richest country (behind Luxembourg) in GDP per head, slips to 13th in quality of life. Britain languishes in 29th place.  It has long been accepted that material well-being alone does not adequately measure quality of life. Money matters, of course, but surveys suggest that over the decades big increases in income have translated into only a modest rise in satisfaction. Although rising incomes and expanded individual choice are highly valued, some of the factors associated with modernisationsuch as the breakdown of traditional institutions and the erosion of family valuesin part offset its positive impact.  But how to combine in a single, comparative statistic the factors believed to influence peoples happiness? There have been many attempts, none entirely successful: the factors selected, and the weights assigned to them, tend to be arbitrary. Subjective surveys of life satisfaction have been attracting growing interestespecially since the evidence is that people in different countries and cultures cite similar criteria for being contentedbut getting comparable surveys across many countries is hard and there is too much margin for error for a truly objective quality-of-life index.  So ours takes a new approach. We use life-satisfaction surveys (assembling the average scores for 74 countries) as a starting point for weighting the various factors that determine quality of life. A regression analysis suggests that as many as nine indicators have a significant influence, and can be turned into an equation explaining more than 80% of the variation in countries life-satisfaction scores. The main factor is income, but other things are also important: health, freedom, unemployment, family life, climate, political stability and security, gender equality, and family and community life. We feed the factors into the equation, measuring them using forecasts for 2005 where possible (in four cases) and latest data for slower-changing indicators, such as family life and political freedom. The resulting score, on a scale of one to ten, gives the quality-of-life index. A full explanation of the methodology and a full country ranking are available to download here.  Ireland wins because it successfully combines the most desirable elements of the new (the fourth-highest GDP per head in the world in 2005, low unemployment, political liberties) with the preservation of certain cosy elements of the old, such as stable family and community life. Offsetting its poor climate and, by rich-country standards, gender inequality are a higher political stability and security. Even if GNPnot available for all countries, but in Irelands case significantly lower than GDPis used to measure income, Ireland still wins.  Britain, by contrast, mixes high income per head with high levels of social and family breakdown; it comes bottom among the 15 countries of the pre-enlargement European Union. America ranks above the EU-15 average. Italy performs well but Germany and France do notbelying the notion that big euro-zone nations compensate for their economic sluggishness with a better quality of life than America.  China, for all the excitement over its development, still falls in the lower half of the league. Proud Russians will be disturbed to find themselves at the wrong end of the table. Bottom of the lot is Zimbabwe, where things have gone from bad to worse under Robert Mugabe.  In 1986, in response to an early attempt to measure well-being across countries, The Times scoffed: Can anyone really assess, in mathematical or other terms, the value of living in Britain? Well, they can tryon the basis of what people around the world themselves say about life satisfaction. No doubt critics will poke holes in this index too. Except, of course, in Ireland. </quote>  <img src="http://www.economist.com/images/worldin2005/qualitytable.gif"/>	howardb	both	 false

France was able to stall the fall with the real person, Nicolas election, a politician who despite of whatever differences I or anyone can has with his views, at least is a refreshing entrance, on camera and off camera is more real than any of the other cadre of politicians, a bunch of photogenic, actor like politicians who ( Like the Clinton's read Dee Dee Myer and G.

About health care :  <quote orig_author="gunnut"> I'm not against universal health care system. I just want people to have the chance to opt out of paying for it and using it. You can pay the government for it and use it. I want to keep my money and buy my own care from a private company. It's about choice. Socialism does not offer choices. It believes people are too stupid to choose. So it puts a bunch of people in a committee and choose for other people.  </quote>  I can imagine a system in which people have the choice : "state health care or private insurance, what do you prefer for you and your family ?" No problem for me. That makes me remember a discussion. A few weeks ago, someone said me something like "I pay too much for the french state health care, I don't need health care so much and I lost money". I said "Well, OK. But if you had the choice, what would you do ? Go out of the system and find a cheaper private company for you, your wife, and your children ? In the future, all you'll need is in the deal between you and your company (or the next one), don't ask me and the other tax-payers to spend an Euro for your family's health if the company doesn't want. Would you sign for this ?" The answer was no.	cesm	vote	 false

Gap's closing a bit recently, i think. Dirty cities... ever been to the Ruhrpott, Berlin or Ludwigshafen? *brr* As for riots and bombs... nah, not really. They tend to be more localized in France, and i'm not only talking about the banlieus. In Germany, these tend to be spread out far more, perhaps owing to the federal structure instead of France centralism. Crime... Germany 6.3 million "incidents" in the official statistics, i.e. 76 per 1,000 ppl on average. No idea about France.  Btw, healthcare?  Germany has this dual-path opt-out concept. There's a basic requirement for everyone to have insurance, however the insurance itself is provided by private companies, with competition among them - not by a government-sponsored agency like with the NHS. The social element of these private insurance companies is maintained by a centralized redistribution fond between these (iirc several hundred) companies.  Once you're above a certain pay bracket (meaning you can viably support this financially too), you can additionally opt out of the usual "basic coverage" package deals of the socalled legal health insurance (which uses earnings-based variable premiums at certain rates) and opt for customized coverage concepts with private insurance (which uses customized premiums).  As for high tax rates... German tax law (on the employee's side) breaks down into:  18.9% - income tax (sliding scale) 9.95% - pension (fixed percentage) 7.30% - health insurance (average; 6.8-7.8% depending on provider) 1.65% - unemployment insurance (fixed percentage) 1.00% - "solidarity" payment for East Germany (fixed percentage) 0.85% - care insurance (fixed percentage)  Tax class I (single), scaled for income around 35,000 EUR/annum. Above are mandatory payments, total 39.65%. Income Tax gets roughly halved if you're in Tax Class III (married, split tax, low-tax class).	kato	6.3	 false

Also wht rape someone when for $50 you can nail someone way hotter than you'd ever get normally anyway.  The Netherlands is clean, it is so very clean it's awesome. The Dutch are wonderful people (if a little odd) and it is a welcoming country more or less.

What about Chicago? You could take the train if you didn't want to deal with having a car in the city.  </quote>  DH grew up not far from the Lake, so he is not into that idea. I'll be in Chicago twice this summer to see family, so that's not really a vacation trip for us since I'm from there and we go all the time.  I am really liking the Denver idea though.

If you did the train to Chicago, I would actually drive to St Louis and then catch the train. Other driveable locations would be Des Moines (much cooler than you think, maybe someone from there can chime in), Boulder (a little further than Denver), Minneapolis, and Dallas. I haven't been to Eureka Springs, but know a lot of people who really like it there. Not sure if any of these really fit your desire for being poolside, I guess if you go early summer that would work.	midwest07	mentioned	 false

Singapore	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3140780	Singapore locks up U.S. man for possessing porn Thu Aug 25,11:18 AM ET  Singapore police handcuffed and locked up a U.S. citizen for bringing 58 pornographic DVDs and video CDs into the wealthy city-state when he moved to Singapore last year, a newspaper reported Thursday.  The Straits Times said Singapore state prosecutors had dropped charges of possessing uncertified and obscene films against Tran Nghia Hong after he presented them with a declaration by his brother, stating that he was missing "certain DVDs."  The films, found by Singapore customs officers in a shipment of his belongings from California, included titles such as "Frivolous Lola," "Copulation Nation" and "Lord of the Strings."  "I was handcuffed and put in a lock-up for four hours after I was charged," the report quoted Tran, 35, as saying.  Tran, a financial controller at U.S. Internet equipment maker Cisco Systems, could have been fined up to S$500 for each disc, up to a maximum of S$20,000, or up to six months in prison, or both.  Despite efforts to loosen some of its social controls, many tough rules remain in Singapore. "Playboy" magazine is banned, while oral sex remains technically illegal under a law that says "whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animals" can be fined and jailed up to 10 years, or even for life.  In recent years, Singapore has partially relaxed its famous ban on chewing gum, allowed some bars to stay open for 24 hours and ended a ban on the popular U.S. sitcom "Sex and the City." <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20050825/od_nm/singapore_porn_dc;_ylt=AhzKN85qt.145DJOFYK26dqs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3NW1oMDRpBHNlYwM3NTc-">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20050825/...RpBHNlYwM3NTc-</a>  I don't see how a ban on chewing gun should even be a government affair, let alone whatever movies this poor man (whose name and employer is now spread across the internet) wants to watch.

But they just confiscate it and tell you to bug off before they press charges (we all know what they'dbe doing with them). Althought its only when you bring them in bulk. It seems like you've got them for sale. Singapore should also have a major piracy issue.  Chewing gum (and similar chewables) are banned in several countries. Not in public spaces that is. Because people then spit it on the street. Singapore prides itself on cleanliness. In Dubai, the Indian/Pakistani favorite Pan is banned. It creates this reddish spit in your mouth which some people love spitting out. Ugly stains.  Just mentioning it since both cities have a lot of similarities.	Asim Aquil	should	 false

It is mandatory to use condoms, any erring customer will be bashed by the bouncers. Oral sex is classified under abnormal sexual acts and is usually determined by a confession from the offender. Recently a cop was fired and locked up for 6 months because he had oral sex with his GF. As for chewing gums, medicinal gums were recently unbanned.

San Francisco	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490151	The first week of April, 2004, in San Francisco is certainly something to think about. I'd suggest that the first order of business would be to find a host who can accomodate the gathering. With people coming great distances to meet and visit with other A2Kers, it is important to have some quiet central place where talk can go on for hours at a time. I doubt that many restaurants, even in San Francisco would suit our purpose. Where will the gathering be centered?  Once that is out of the way, acceptable hotels in the vicinity can be scouted. San Francisco rooms are expensive, but transportation there is very reasonable and accessable. If Natalie and I are able to come over for the gathering, our youngest son would probably be able to find a place for us. Finding an acceptable restaurant in San Francisco shouldn't be difficult at all. The Empress of China in Chinatown used to serve outstanding meals, and there are so many other great locations that the difficulty would be in just choosing one. Drinks at the Top of the Mark would be very nice.  Side trips down to Big Sur, or up to the Woods would be great, but if the Albuquerque experience is any indication, most folks will end up sitting around the Gathering's central location in discussion. There were nine in Albuquerque, but San Francisco may draw twice that many. Someone on the ground there should begin planning very soon.	Asherman	April	 false

San Francisco	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490151	No sequence of thought here, just riffing.  Perhaps we could rent a suite at some great hotel. I think the Sir Frances Drake is still kicking and the St. Francis certainly is. But by definition, that might be biggy bucks.  I have my own peculiar needs, in that it is hard for me to park in downtown sf, being nightblind, I can't drive into garages. But never mind, I can spring once a year for a valet. Not cheerfully.  I am not interested myself in meeting at some airport hotel. This is one of the great cities of the world, we can't do that, imho. There are, as I mentioned before, at least one set and perhaps several more sets, of renovated oldie hotels, not lux but not horrible - pretentions to suave, like wine in the lobby in late afternoon - and fairly centrally located. The one I mentioned before that I stayed at was right in the heart of things, and completely congenial.  Restaurants, top of the line at any level. Don't get me started. I have the last four years' worth of the SF chronicle reviews of best restaurant summaries in my travel file at work. Just ask.  My main question to all is -- do you want to meet outside of town for less expensive and possible also beautiful, like the strange and wonderful place, but not necessarily that one, that I stayed in Inverness last year, and make SF a day trip,  or  stay in SF at a moderate hotel in city, as in one of those I just mentioned,  or an expensive one, trip of a lifetime, and some of us could stay in the lesser than swankos....but if some were in the greats, then we could perhaps meet off and on in the bar/restaurant of one. I for one like the breakfast cafe at the St. Francis. And, the good part, the food was good and I was almost alone in the restaurant with my sunday edition of the NYT when I went there on a short walk from my Galleria park hotel, around ten on a sunday morning.  Or at a Days Inn or travellodge away from town, like Rohnert Park or similar places an hour out of town, and group for trips to the city. That runs for about $37 a night and is perfectly clean, freeway close, not gross. I have stayed there about five times, fine. I suppose we could gather by the pool-ette.  There is one more place that can be booked and often is, called Asilomar. University types often meet there, it is in Pacific Grove, I think....not an easy access to sf, exactly. But it could be rentable, I think, if I would only look it up, as a site for all of us, and we could get group transportation going to the city. Asilomar is, I think, beautiful, and one can do lots of gorgeous walks. I think it is by the Monterey aquarium and the 17 mile drive. People go there to talk philosophy, great books, etc. This is Steinbeck's area, albeit more pricey now. Finally, we could meet at some airport hotel, like I just slammed. Well, I think that is easily as expensive as some charming renovated place in town but they would surely be convenient to SFO...which could be really useful.  Which brings up...would everybody come into sfo...there are good airports in San Jose and Oakland as well.  Complicated subject, this, good we are starting to talk relatively early.	ossobuco	airports	 false

San Francisco	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490151	osso, All good suggestions. I think San Francisco might be affordable right now, because of the high vacancy rates experienced since 9-11. If people want to opt for a more economical location, there are plenty between San Francisco and San Jose. If people are interested, I can contact several hotels in San Francisco to see if we can get some group rates. I think San Francisco would be a good home base, because many optional day tours up north or south would be readily available. Parking in San Francisco is not recommended, because it'll cost an arm and a leg, and part of your torso - and that's if your brains survive. Millbrae through San Francisco, and up and down the East Bay has Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). San Jose to San Francisco has Cal Train. San Jose has the Rosecrucian Egyptian Museum and Winchester Mystery House. Santa Clara has Great America. Vallejo has Sea World. We need to get some feedback on what your desires are concerning 1) cost and location of lodging, 2) number of days, 3) day tours, 4) and interests. San Francisco also just opened a new Asian Art Museum. Pier 39 has a seaworld where you walk in plastic tubes, and you see the fishes, sharks, and other sea life all around you.

San Francisco	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490151	Natalie and I will want to be either in, or close to San Francisco. Our youngest son is there and we've been promising a visit for several years. If we were to begin listing the enticements of San Francisco at 20/day we wouldn't exhaust the list between now and next June.  Our recent experience is that the attendees far prefer sitting around in a large circle talking for hours to even the best side/day trip. Folks here saw little beyond their hotel rooms and Corazon, yet I don't think anyone was too disappointed. It is the opportunity for direct interaction that draws participants together, and everything else is secondary. We tend to be older people, so quiet venues that make hearing less a problem are preferable. The Corazon group couldn't get through an hour without lighting up, so the ready availability of a place to smoke while carrying on conversation would be a big plus. We probably overdid the snacks and food, but cold drinks were very popular. The most popular drink was tea. Diet sodas and ice water were much more in demand than alcoholic drinks. I think that during the entire event no more than five beers were drunk, and a wonderful bottle of tequila brought by Frbaezer is still unopened. Usually our guests belly up to the bar for a shot of single malt Islay, but not the A2Kers. Sitzkreig was the order of the day in Albuquerque, and I believe that's likely to be the group's preference for the San Francisco gathering as well.  If those of you in relatively close proximity of San Francisco would get together either here, or by PM, it may be possible to figure out some central venue that meets the basic criteria for a central gathering place. That is the sine qua non, in my opinion, for successfully planning the April '04 event. Get that set and everything else will fall into place.  I know the frustration of trying to plan without knowing how many to provide for. Unfortunately, getting a good count is probably impossible. Many folks want to attend, but as the time grows shorter the obstacles increase in size and number. At one point we expected the number of attendees for the Western Gathering to be between 12 and 16. We ended with nine, and three of those were "in-town". Of course, we are further off the beaten path than San Francisco. On the other hand, the cost of coming to Corazon were miniscule compared to the costs of spending 3-14 days in San Francisco. Cost for older retired folks is almost always a more serious consideration than time, or scheduling.	Asherman	listing	 false

As for dates, we need to consider the 'long' weekend for folks that might have a difficult time getting off from work. Most of the respondents so far opted for the first week of April 2004, so we just sort of tied it down to April 2 through 4 with some staying for more days before and/or after those dates. Downtown San Francisco makes more sense, because there's more access to the city from the airports in the area. Once in San Francisco, public transportation is available to venture out to the 'hot spots' day or night.

Bay, where I used to live before moving to New Mexico.  <a href="http://www.ci.alameda.ca.us/community/introducing_alameda.html">http://www.ci.alameda.ca.us/community/introducing_alameda.html</a>  I have lots of contacts there to help planning a SF gathering. Public accomodations are plentiful. And Alameda would be tons less expensive than most of the surrounding cities, with the possible exception of Oakland.  Alameda is in the center of the greater SF Bay area. It is less than 15 minutes from the Oakland Airport, which is the easiest airport to fly in and out of in the greater Bay Area. A direct freeway link from Alameda to San Francisco is a car trip of less than 1/2 hour. The Bart rapid transit trip is even less.

It is also a bird sanctuary.***  Harbor Bay Isle (where I lived) is on a second Alameda island called Bay Farm Island. There are two draw-bridges to cross to get from Oakland to Alameda. Actually, there is a third bicycle bridge. There are walking paths along the SF Bay shoreline where the San Francisco skyline seems only a few miles away. Or you can walk the paths along the meandering lagoon systems crossing the wooden bridges to get to the other side. There are grassy areas for lounging and chatting and parks and picnic areas, too. There is a unusual shopping center with several excellent, but not too expensive restaurants, a deli and an ice cream parlor. There are basketball courts and a baseball field along with several tennis courts. And, Ash, there also is a swimming pool. And for football fans, the Raiders officers and training field is less that two miles away. There also is a golf course across the road from Harbor Bay Isle near the Veteran's Park, a large, beautifully landscape park overlooking the estuary where the brown pelicans play. All of these ammenities are open to the public and won't cost you a dime.  If you are interested in Alameda as a home base for the SF Gathering, let me know and I can obtain more information for the April 2004 dates.  I'm getting homesick just telling you about my wonderful former home town. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad"/> ---BumbleBeeBoogie  ***The Lagoon at Harbor Bay Isle: It's For The Birds By BumbleBeeBoogie  From my corner office window, one can see a lovely stretch of lagoon where animal and bird life abound. Squirrels romp across fence tops and up the trunks of pine trees. Occasional opossums and raccoons make nocturnal visits under the arching Alder trees.  But its the bird life on the lagoon that never ceases to enthrall and even amuse me. One day as June was drawing to a close, I was distracted by loud noises outside. What made me look up from my work and out the window was the raucous honking and screeching of a flotilla of iridescent blue-green-feathered geese, white ducks and dark gray mudhens all frantically paddling in the same direction.  I walked out to a balcony to see what all the fuss was about. Up stream and across the lagoon, a father and daughter were seated on a dock, their dangling legs reflected in the sparkling water, throwing food to their bird audience.  Clouds of gray-white seagulls swooped through the air catching bits of food in their beaks while the geese, ducks and mudhens paddled in the water in pursuit of the bits of food floating on the water, bumping into each other and scolding furiously.  The approaching bird flotilla from down stream appeared around the bend, honking and screeching loudly to announce its arrival as if to demand "save some for me".  In the late afternoon sun dozens of tiny bird wakes spread across the lagoon as birds neared the dinner spot. Fortunately, there was enough food for the late comers to join in the feast.  I've always wondered how the birds at one end of the lagoon know that someone, out of sight several hundred yards in the other direction, is providing a feast?  However they do it, one handful of birdseed can truly draw a standing room only crowd on the beautiful lagoon.	BumbleBeeBoogie	Alameda	 false

I'm open to Alameda and its environs, because it has excellent public transportation into SF for those wishing to visit. The other good point you make is Oakland International Airport; easier access and egress. c.i.	cicerone imposter	Stage	 false

San Francisco	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490151	I lived in San Francisco, briefly, in 1965. I had just gotten out of the Navy and had a real craving for the fried rice I had grown to love while overseas. I lived on - I think - Bush Street because it was so near Chinatown. I spent a lot of evenings at a place called The Coffee Gallery, because they had a terriffic folk singer there who loved Bob Dylan just as much as I. I have been on a destroyer by the San Francisco Bay Bridge a lot more often than on top of it.	edgarblythe	destroyer	 false

San Francisco	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490151	jjorge, With consideration to all, we're trying to provide info on many different options - locations and price - close enough to the central venue with easy transportation. 1. Oakland International Airport is probably cheaper than SFO, and less crowded. 2. Trains run from the east bay into San Francisco on a regular schedule. 3. Alameda accommodations will probably be more economical than any in San Francisco - or at the very least, better for the same or cheaper price. (I'm rather stingy on paying premium for hotel rooms, but don't mind spending above average for a good meal.) 4. Driving in San Francisco is not recommended, because parking is very expensive, and difficult to find. BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) is the train system used in the greater San Francisco bay area. BTW, how long does it take to take the train from Seattle to SF? c.i.	cicerone imposter	any	 false

Some people have provided some good links for hotels in and around San Francisco, so people will need to make their own plans on transportation and lodging. BART now has a train service from SF International Airport to the city and the general bay area. I'm still trying to locate a venue for the Gatherings. I will also take some people on day trips to Napa/Sonoma Wine Country, Sausalito, Jelly Belly Candy Factory, and possibly to Muir Woods. ci	cicerone imposter	people	 false

San Francisco	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490151	Well, I suppose I should do what I said I would weeks ago, which is list those hotels on the list you supplied, CI, that are near Union Square and intrigue me. There are some I skipped since they seem to be in a slightly iffy spot, but I might be wrong on that. I picked for "charming" as opposed to many star amenities. And I'll re-mention one I stayed at, it was fine...  I may stay in Days Inn (etc) in Rohnert Park or Petaluma for about 40. a night, if I am driving, for one of the nights. But then I have to find a place to put the car in SF near the hotel there for a day or so. I will have to check out if I could leave the car in Larkspur and then take the ferry.... Hmm, I have a friend in Larkspur, and love a pasticceria there...  that would mean I just pack a duffle bag. You will see me perhaps in wrinkles.  Or I may fly, and take shuttle to Market Street and walk to hotel, among those on the list.  My own trip is complicated by late arrival re everybody else, and my nightblindness. So, we'll see. I'll go ahead here and list those hotels in the City that interested me a month or more ago.	ossobuco	shuttle	 false

San Francisco	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490151	Fealola Fealola, this is one of my all time favorite restaurants  WHERE TO FIND THE BEST SOUFFLE RESTAURANT IN THE U.S. By BumbleBeeBoogie  If you are ever in San Francisco, and want to enjoy the best authentic French souffle in the U.S., make a reservation at Café Jacqueline, 1454 Grant Avenue (at Union Street) in North Beach at the edge of China Town. Café Jacqueline, with its classic French country in décor, is one of my favorite restaurants.  The locally famous Café Jacqueline is a tiny store-front restaurant where entree and dessert souffles reign---the only items on the menu---accompanied by simple salads, the best French onion soup you will ever taste, and wine.  Allow sufficient time because this is not a fast-food restaurant. Each souffle is made to order. Sometimes you can chat with the chef (which I've done on a number of occasions) while her electric beaters create her lovely "runny in the middle" souffles. For example, entrée souffles may include black truffles, wild mushrooms, or just Gruyere. The dessert souffles are glorious.  Top off the evening with a concert or a play for a memorable San Francisco evening. Make reservations by calling (415) 981-5565	BumbleBeeBoogie	If	 false

I can confirm that when it comes from San Francisco (190 miles away) it's usually on time, but when it comes from Chicago (1,960 miles away) it's typically 5-14 hours late.

San Francisco	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490151	For the student/backpacker/socializing crowd, Hostelling International has 3 hostels in San Francisco ( <a href="http://www.hiayh.org/hostels/california/sf.htm">link here</a> ) Plus, I've stayed at the one at Marin Headlands ( <a href="http://63.70.211.212/cfdocs/hostels.cfm?CITY=Sausalito">link here</a> ) which is only 20 minutes north of the city, across the Golden Gate (near the beach at the Marine Mammal Rescue Center -- sad but very cool tour!). The one at Montara Lighthouse ( <a href="http://63.70.211.212/cfdocs/hostels.cfm?CITY=Montara">link here</a> ) is also incredibly scenic, 25 miles south of the city.  They have dorm lodging ($15-22) or private rooms ($45-60), but what I like most is that people from all over the world mingle in the kitchen and lounge areas. Great place to get local info, trade stories, play Scrabble and make spontaneous friends from five continents. So many languages being spoken in one place! The hostels have organized trips into the city a few nights a week, group activities and such, for anyone who happens to be around. Friendly outgoing people!

San Francisco	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490151	Nah. Natalie is my wife of 38+ years. Born and raised in Newton, Ma. We met in a coffee house in San Francisco in 1961. She was with the Actor's Workshop and I was in a Buddhist monastry. We moved in together up on Telegraph above North Beach. No electricity, but we did have gas lights and could see Alcatraz by leaning out a window. We were among the last of the Beats and the first of the Hippies. Moved up to Haight and formed one of the first communes there. Left when the scene began to become really crazy. Lived for awhile in the same building as Erik Hoffer, and wrote a song that made the Sopwith Camel an overnight success before they fell back into obscurity. We started toward Mexico where the light was good and the living inexpensive enough that I could paint. We ended up on L.A. with a couple of sons, Shannon (career Army officer, married with two children) and Krishna (sells commercial real estate in San Francisco, and lives with his lady friend for years). Natalie worked for the Post Office to help support us while I finished my two BAs, law school and various grad schools until I got my Masters. Natalie's BA (drama) was from the University of the Pacific. Once our finances got better, Natalie did an M.S.L.S at USC. We both worked for many years in city and county government until retirement a few years ago.  Bumblebee, is an old friend that I met years ago on another internet BB. Aunt Bea was connected for many years with the labor movement, and then became one of the officials running Alameda, an exclusive and closed neighborhood located on an island in the San Francisco Bay. Bumbles retired a year ago, and influenced by my enthusiasm for Albuquerque moved over onto the west bank of the Rio Grande. She has totally rennovated what was already a fine house, and changed the landscaping considerably. She now lives with her pooch, Madison. Maddy is her baby who likes to make a nuisance of himself with visitor's shoelaces and a hyperactive need to jump and run. Beeeee's other familiar is a handyman named Henry. Henry recently was diagonsed with Nile Virus, but is well on the road to recovery. Bea remains a good and close friend, even if she is a wet-back living over with the savages on the west bank.  Does that explain the relationships.	Asherman	We	 false

San Francisco	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490151	For the Corazon Gathering we planned a host of outside activities. There were multiple short to day-long things for attendees to do if they wanted. Trips to nearby reservations, Madrid (a local Arts Community), and to places like Santa Fe/Taos were available. Nature walks ranging from very easy to moderately difficult along the Rio Grande and into the foothills of the Sandias were mapped out. Locally we had tours of museums, the Old Town Plaza, art galleries, and shopping ranging from inexpensive to pricey. We compiled a list of restaurants, and went and "test drove" the ones we weren't familiar with. There was even horse-back riding, if anyone wanted.  Without leaving Corazon, guests could swim or lounge around the pool. We had Scrabble, Trivial Pursuits, jig-saw puzzles, Dominoes, cards &amp; poker chips, Checkers and Chess available.  What did the participants end up doing, you might well ask.  They sat on our patio drinking iced tea, eating chips and dip, smoking and mostly talking. Dys and Di did drive one afternoon to the top of the Sandias, but the weather that day wasn't clement. Talk is what folks wanted to do, and they did it from early each morning until late each evening. We thought of trying to format at least one evenings discussion, but the group really preferred unstructured conversation that ranged from obscure quotations from long-dead thinkers to what their cat's favorite toy once was. The Corazon group tended to shy away from public restaurants because so many of us are to some degree deaf. Bars, nightclubs, saloons and casinos didn't seem to tempt any of our guests as far as I know. Though some of our members are sensitive about having their pictures taken, that didn't seem to matter in the relaxed atmosphere.  The San Francisco gathering has a ton of wonderful things to do, after all the Bay Area is rich in attractions. Participants will almost certainly end up at a variety of hotels and accommodations. No "in-house" dinners, drinks and snacks are likely, so eating and drinking "out" will be probably be the norm. Not having a central location where everyone can "flop" for up to 16 hours is a handicap, if the participants desires and expectations of what the Gathering should be are the same as we experienced. Folks want to talk and have extended interchanges with internet friends. I believe people want the chance for their acquaintances to deepen into a warmer friendship. It takes a bit of shared time to appreciate how deep, or I suppose how shallow, our companions might be. I think we look forward to sharing some experiences, like a trip to &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;, but mostly we want to talk and hear how our site correspondents think and "fit into" a more "normal" conversation.  I hope that some sort of hospitality suite can be arranged where the group as a whole can regard as "home", and where extended conversation is possible.	Asherman	ton	 false

The next q is whether people are willing to "donate" into a fund to rent a place - say 10 percent (only a suggestion) of what you're already spending for lodging.

I don't know if they've recovered from that yet, but some of the best chinese food I've ever eaten was in San Francisco.  Ah, that reminds me of the street vendors with the hot dogs on Market Street. Those were always good. I used to love Market Street at lunchtime... all the people. So many people, doing so many things... makes my mind wonder, it does.

And the Bay Tours were pretty cool too. Red &amp; White and Blue &amp; Gold. I always liked the Blue &amp; Gold better, myself.  Oh, and there's an aquarium in Peir 39, where you actually go under the tank, and the fish swim around you. *That* was always pretty cool. And they had the 'petting' zoo on one of the levels, the kids got to hold starfish and stuff like that, pet baby sharks. Talk about power... those sharks are nuthin' but muscle.

San Francisco	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193234-6490151	I need to get some feedback on whether I can excuse myself from the San Francisco Gathering in early April. Here's what happened. We had a 49 day memorial service at our home for my mother-in-law who passed away last month. The minister came from Sacramento to perform the service. He informed us today that he is taking a small group on a trip to Japan for 12 days beginning on March 25. My wife asked if he still had space for others to join his trip, and he said "yes." This is an opportunity to travel with somebody that lived in Japan and speaks excellent English. He will be our guide. I will also need to get an excuse from Grand Jury service, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel in a small group with a Buddhist priest. The group will also visit Himeji Castle, where my mother-in-law's grandfather served under the shogun, and their family crest is in that castle which my wife wants to see. How about it? Will you excuse me? c.i.	cicerone imposter	excuse	 false

Of course, in Minnesota, noone sees the UK as any form of mother country, whereas when you're in New England, every cultural place you visit refers to the first settlers who were mostly British.  I've actually found that the less ethnic/cultural ties an American has with the UK, the more anglophile they're likely to be. I was actually amazed by the number of African Americans (ok, someone might point out that being African American probably means some form of European ancestry) who were quite interested in the UK, London etc. It's when those ties are fairly strong, that they don't know how to relate.  I've heard that the support for the IRA has calmed down with people in the US understanding a bit more about the situation.  As for the French being more important: surely you're not referring to that ridiculous comment from Obama that was misinterpreted.  The thing with the US is that a lot of European countries vye for the privilege to be called the special partner but the fact is the US has special partnerships with everyone. The UK should accept that they're behind the political creation of the US and that the majority (for now) of the US speak English and that because of that, there have been strong cultural ties over the years. That will always make the UK important to a certain extent but it most certainly doesn't suggest any form of exclusive relationship. Of course France or Spain or even Ireland will want to stake a claim to being important partners but those countries were also very important in the formation of the US. We were just referring to Texas and Florida who have no historical ties with the British but strong ones with Spain (and France). Louisiana used to take up something like a 1/3 of the US territory and was owned (at least, according to a political claim, noone actually lived there) by the French. Large parts of New England are also quite influenced by the arrival of French-speaking Canadians in the 19th century who were looking for work.  In the case of France, the ties are pretty weak: other than historical (they had a claim over Louisiana but considering that the territory was virtually uninhabited except towards the South with Acadians and obviously the French won the American Revolution for them), not that many people are of French ancestry and because, like the British, the settlers from France arrived such a long time ago, few Americans actually are aware of the ancestry and few have any cultural link. Even in Louisiana, Cajun French is a dying language and is a language that developed independently, in cultural isolation from metropolitan French.	SamTheMan	referring	 false

I'm sure there are many New Yorkers who are not like that, they are not the people who I am criticizing.  A lot of international companies have their HQ's in New York. Jobs in these companies by their very nature demand an incredible amount of energy. Sometimes with this type of job, people end up not getting the balance - between responsibilities to their job, responsibilities to their family, and responsibilities to their community - right.  </quote>  I'll think you'll find that a lot of international corporations also have their HQ's in Texas due to its low corporation tax and no income tax. Yes, some of those jobs will require a lot of time and dedication, but the ones that require absolute dedication (i.e. work becoming the one dominating constant in a person's life) will form the minority of what you'd call an "office job". And getting the balance "right" is completely subjective - there is no "right" balance as everyone has different opinions and aspirations. For some people, having a life that revolves around their work suits them just fine, and it's not really your place to say they're any less of a person because of it.  Calling NYC a hell-hole because it's an economic powerhouse is pretty lame tbh - the vast majority of people in this world view NYC as a bastion of opportunity and liberty.

Plenty of jobs do benefit the community, I have no problem with the people in those jobs.

But, if you remain incapable of adult debate, and wish to leave the thread, there is nothing I can do to stop you.  </quote>  This is hilarious. Now you're taking the moral high-ground because I have better things to do than to argue with an in-denial communist idealist. The "problem" you're outlining (people who are work-orientated) - exists in all facets of society, and it's quite simply mind-boggling how you are attacking NYC with this very general phenomenon. And when you refer to "duty towards the community" or "duty towards the family" could you please name some specifics, because repeating that over and over just undermines your whole arguement with its monotony and vagueness.  Believe it or not, successful businessmen who work in the corporate world are human beings, not faceless drones. They have families, they have kids, they socialise with friends, they help out in the neighbourhood and so on. I know these very sorts of people in my family. I plan to have a career in finance or consultancy, and what you're saying is pretty irritating - as if having a high-flying career automatically means that you are a selfish money-whore. Even at the moment I am juggling internships, family life, volunteering in the community, socialising with friends and studying at university. Stop attacking these people - it seems like you have a chip on your shoulder or something. Even if a high paid investment banker was only cared about his work, he would benefit the community hugely (moreso than the vast majority of people) through his tax payments (income tax, variable taxes on goods and services purchases etc).  You made it personal when you said I'm incapable of adult debate. Well, I'm going to make it personal too. You sound like someone who's life hadn't turned out the way you wanted it to turn out, and now you're hating on the very people that you previously apsired to be. Stop hating. Calling NYC a hell-hole because there are some work-orientated individuals there (and they exist all over the world mind you, even in your precious Texas), isn't really what I'd call "adult debate".  Edit: And please could you outline how someone being work-orientated would negatively harm their community? Back your points with explanations. Again, hardly "adult" debating skills.

Allen West, R-Fla., charged President Obama with "fomenting racism" in his reelection efforts, noting also that Obama is a "literal manifestation" of how Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement succeeded.  "With all of this progress, why is it that we continue to hear charges of racism emanating from the left, and most disturbingly, from the White House itself?" West said in a statement today. "It seems anytime there is criticism of the President or any of his black members of his administration, such as Attorney General Eric Holder, that criticism is decried as racist." West recalled, in particular, that Holder has claimed some of his critics following Operation Fast and Furious were motivated by racial animus.  West said that "this [2012] campaign must be about ideas, policy and the direction of this country, and the President must not hide behind a curtain of so-called racial bias."  He concluded by suggesting that Dr. King would be "devasted" by Obama's handling of racial issues as president:  My message to President Obama is this: 'Mr. President, your very in office demonstrates Dr. King's dream has indeed come true. But how devastated would Dr. King be to know the Americans who are still fomenting racism at the highest levels are the very people for whom he fought for and died?"  read it all..

Dr. King knew that communication and negotiation were essential to progress and sought to end 'the tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.' He strongly believed in the tenets of the Constitution while he wrestled with the concept of 'just versus unjust laws.'  Martin Luther King recognized that the 'appalling silence of good people' could be every bit as harmful as the 'hateful words and actions of bad people.' Through his struggles, he was sustained by love and faith – the source of his continued optimism.  As we note the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, we can rejoice in the progress we have achieved as a nation – a place where a person should be judged by the 'content of their character' rather than the 'color of their skin.' At the same time, we must be mindful of those who have failed to recognize the most basic of civil rights. Today is a day to celebrate our common heritage and our shared struggles.

For the <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41414761/ns/world_news-mideastn_africa/">Muslim Brotherhood opinion</a> :  "A longtime strategist for the Muslim Brotherhood said Thursday that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his senior associates must be put on trial and held to account for their 'crimes' against the Egyptian people.  "Mubarak ' is like Dracula,' said Youssef Nada, an Egyptian-born banker who served for decades as the Muslim Brotherhoods de facto 'foreign minister' and remains an influential adviser. 'He is a ruthless dictator who betrayed his people and killed a lot of people. He must be tried for what he did and held to account.'  "Nadas comments, made in a telephone interview from his home in a tiny Italian enclave in the Swiss Alps, appear to signal a more aggressive -- and potentially dangerous -- stance by the Islamic group on Egypts political crisis.  "Just moments before he spoke to NBC News, the Muslim Brotherhood, which had largely remained quiet during the first few days of demonstrations last week, released a formal statement demanding that Mubarak immediately step down. 'We demand that this regime is overthrown and we demand the formation of a national unity government for all the factions,' it said."  Some of Mubarak's recent crimes have been seen around the world during the last ten days.  Or maybe billionaires answer to a higher law?	georgephillip	like	 false

THEY ARE TAX INCREASES</a> &lt;LINK  BOORTZ: "Nancy Pelosi had an interview yesterday with CNBC's Maria Bartiromo, and Maria actually asked a good question! She challenged Nancy Pelosi on the Bush tax cuts, suggesting to Princess Nancy that allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire would be the same thing as a tax increase. So here's the question: "Does the expiration of the Bush tax cuts mean that there will be tax increases?" This could have been answered in one word: Yes. But Nancy couldn't bring herself to admit it. Instead. <a href="http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2009/10/pelosi_obama_tax_increases.html">Here is what she had to say via The Swamp</a> : "That wasn't a tax increase,'' Pelosi said. "It is.. eliminating a tax decrease that was there... It was controversial to begin with. It is... a boon to those who have had it for now. But I think that you will see that happen. "That affects, what? The upper two percent of our population. What we're trying to do is lower... taxes for the middle class, relieve burdens... on business. So that we can be competitive in job creation. And I think you'll see some interesting things emerge-- from the conversations we're having now. '' What about allowing those tax breaks to expire at a fragile time in an economic recovery, the speaker was asked. "I don't think many people here see, nor do the American people see those tax cuts at the high end as being job-creating,'' she said. "They don't... think that that's part of the reason we're in the fiscal, the budgetary situation that we're in, because those tax cuts cost money. And... they were... a cost to our budget, without any commensurate impact on the economy for job creation. To return money to the treasury. So, nobody sees those as a job-creator. "Return money to the treasury?" Did you get that? Tanking earned income away from a small businessman --- and make no mistake, the vast majority of people who will suffer these tax increases are small businessmen and women --- so taking their money is "returning money to the treasury!"  ____________________  This is dangerous. This woman, these Statists are dangerous. When are these people going to get it through their heads that the wealth of this nation belongs to the people?  Oh?

This fails to take into consideration, however, the inherent imperfection of the various market forces libertarians would depend upon once the Constitution and its case law are removed from the equation.  To assume, for example, that the market would address the problem of a racist hotel owner who refuses to accommodate blacks by being put out of business by outraged consumers who refuse to do business with a racist business, is naïve and unrealistic. Markets were not designed to ensure the consistent application of the fundamental principles expressed by the Constitution, that the laws be applied equally.	C_Clayton_Jones	believe	 false

Honest question.  </quote>  I understand that a bill with "Civil Rights" in its name does not necessarily advance the cause of civil rights, anymore than a bill with the word "PATRIOT" is necessarily patriotic or a bill with "reform" is necessarily a reform. In this case however, I think that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 actually did advance the cause of civil rights. To oppose the bill, then, amounts to opposing certain civil rights.  It is important to note that the portions of the bill restricting the rights of certain private businesses to discriminate on the basis of race were not motivated by an abstract or speculative concern. They were motivated by centuries of history in which both government and private individuals oppressed an entire race. Ron Paul's ideal version of the bill, which I understand to include those restrictions on public entities but exclude those on private entities, would have been a dramatically weaker half-measure.	ladyliberal	half-measure	 false

Ron Paul	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888098	As an African American who was born and raised in Mississippi, and as a republican who plans on voting for Ron Paul in the primary, I'll say this:  I understand Paul's view of the world. I understand Paul's reasoning behind not supporting civil rights legislation. He does not believe that government should intervene in the practices of private businesses. If you don't wish to hire "African Americans" then you shouldn't have too.  I also want to say, though I agree with Paul on many issues (anti-gun control, less regulation, audit the fed, prohibition, freedom of speech, less taxes, control the border, no U.N., end the EPA, smaller government, bring troops home, etc) I completely disagree with him on this issue. I believe that every business has it's own right to govern itself, I also believe I have the fundamental right as a human being to be treated and looked upon as a human being and not as an "African American". No matter how flawed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 may or may not have been, THIS was it's major accomplishment, the assurance that when it came to both the private and public sector my right to be considered "human" rather than "black" was protected.  When I send my application into a job, I should not have to worry about whether or not this job hires "coloreds", neither should anyone else have to worry about whether this job hires their particular shade of color, race, or ethnicity. I should only have to worry about whether or not I am qualified for this particular job (Mind you all that I am NOT arguing the merits of AA, just the idea that individual liberties should be protected). The big difference between myself and Paul here is that I believe I have a right not to be discriminated against because of the color of my skin, while he does not see this as a right, but theorizes that the free market will take care of itself when it comes to discrimination (ie when people see that businesses are racist, they won't go and those businesses will be boycotted/abandoned and either have to close or change their business policies).  There's a fundamental flaw in this theory, and history has shown this from the simple fact that there were thousands of business that had racist practices during Jim Crow that thrived. The flaw is, requiring businesses to treat HUMANITY with equal respect and dignity is not a concept opposed to individual freedoms. Quite the opposite. It protects individual freedoms.  With that said, though I don't agree with Paul on THIS, I still believe he's the best choice for this nation at this present time, and I do not believe his stance on this issue comes from his being prejudice or racist, but because he has a fundamentally different understanding of the issue than I do and many others do. I disagree with his understanding. But I disagree respectfully, seeing the merit in his arguments. The fact is nobody is talking about repealing the 1964 Civil Rights Act, I don't even believe that's possible considering that nobody in congress would vote for such a repeal. If you really want to talk about Paul's record on issues regarding race, let's talk about addressing the government run drug war which Paul understands is statistically detrimental to the African American community.	uptownlivin90	voting	 false

Ron Paul	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888098	I've seen Paul on this subject before. It's easy to jump to the conclusion that his is a racist position, but I don't believe that to be the case. I think it's a radical-libertarian, radical-free-market position. Paul was all for striking down the Jim Crow laws, but thought that was as far as the federal government could or should go. Where he had a problem was in prohibiting a private business from discriminating on the basis of race. He believes in an absolute right of a business owner to conduct his business as he sees fit, no matter how wrong and appalling the basis for his decisions.  I disagree with him, of course. A business does not have any such absolute right, something which follows inevitably from the principle that your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins. As an entity dealing with the public in consequential ways, a business is not in the same category as private behavior engaged in at home. Businesses employ people and so impact people's livelihoods; they sell products and so impact public safety; they conduct operations that impact the environment. In all of these areas they potentially infringe the rights of others more than people do when engaging in purely private behavior. As such, they are subject to a greater degree of scrutiny and restraint. Or at least that is how I see it, and why I believe that Paul and other free-market purists are wrong.  A right of business owners to discriminate on the basis of race is inconsistent with the right of people to employment and housing regardless of race; both rights cannot simultaneously exist. The Civil Rights Act restrains private business as well as state governments for good reason.	Dragon	Where	 false

It involves the idea that government can legislate morality effectively. Looking at the drug war, it obviously can't.  What ultimately ended business discrimination was two things: 1. People over time became more tolerable of those different than them. That fact the Civil Rights act even passed is proof that much of this had already occurred not only without government interference but in spite of government interference in the opposite direction (jim crow laws). 2. It is very unprofitable to run a business that prevents large segments of the population from patronizing it. Not only will you lose minority customers' money, you will likely be boycotted by those who are sympathetic with the minorities. This did not happen prior to the Civil Rights Act because laws were on the books that forced segregation.  Today, the result of government intrusion is that in the name of fighting discrimination, all-women gyms are sued and forced to open to men; a gay softball team is sued for rejecting bisexual members; A wedding photographer in New Mexico is fined thousands of dollars for refusing to take photos of a homosexual wedding. (those are all real world examples that have actually happened).  Instead of just eliminating segregation, the Civil Rights Act imposed mandatory association. Ron Paul is right. Neither mandatory segregation, nor mandatory association, is appropriate in a free society.	ShackledNation	right	 false

Therefore, the only way the federal government could ensure an employer was not violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to ensure that the racial composition of a business's workforce matched the racial composition of a bureaucrat or judge's defined body of potential employees. Thus, bureaucrats began forcing employers to hire by racial quota. Racial quotas have not contributed to racial harmony or advanced the goal of a color-blind society. Instead, these quotas encouraged racial balkanization, and fostered racial strife. Of course, America has made great strides in race relations over the past forty years. However, this progress is due to changes in public attitudes and private efforts. Relations between the races have improved despite, not because of, the 1964 Civil Rights Act." -Ron Paul  You are ignoring all the negative affects of the civil rights act, such as all women gyms being sued for discriminating against men. In many ways, the Civil Rights Act (minus the end of public segregation and Jim Crow Laws of course) increased racial tensions.

Ron Paul	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888098	What does Walter Williams think of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? By the way, Walter Williams is black. So surely he must disagree with Ron Paul, right?  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqod16fhMPE">Walter E Williams - Discrimination and Liberty - YouTube</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqod16fhMPE"> Walter E Williams - Discrimination and Liberty - YouTube</a>  Nope. He agrees completely with Ron Paul. For those who do not watch the video, he says "Title II of the Civil Rights Act is unconstitutional."  "The true commitment, or the test of one's commitment to freedom of association, doesn't come when he allows people to be free to associate in the manner in which he deems ok. The true test of one's commitment to freedom of association is when you allow people to associate in ways you find offensive, that﻿ you find personally offensive."  I don't bring in the opinion of a black economist because I think the fact that he is black automatically makes him an expert on civil rights. I bring his opinion in to try and knock some sense in to many of you on this board that equate opposition to the civil rights act to racism.  One final bit of food for thought: Are there laws outlawing customers from discriminating against employers? No. Not a single one. But do you see white people refusing to go to establishments run by black people because the law does not force them to go there? Again, no. That is evidence enough that you don't need government to outlaw discrimination that is harmful to society.	ShackledNation	agrees	 false

Ron Paul	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888098	As I said above, I understand where Paul is coming from -- not racism, but a belief in an absolute right of a business owner to conduct his business as he chooses, regardless of any other considerations -- but I disagree. I disagree not merely on this point, but in general.  A business cannot be treated like private behavior in the home, because it has great impact on other people: employees, customers, the community. It is for that reason perfectly sound to apply greater obligations and restrictions to business behavior than we do to private behavior in the home. And there is a graduation of obligation depending on the nature and size of the business  If I'm baking bread just for myself and my family, I can do it any way I want. If I'm baking it for sale, though, I have to meet reasonable health-code restrictions and disclose my ingredients.  If I'm the only person working in my business, then I can oppress and exploit my sole employee (myself) anyway I want -- expect long hours, low (or no) pay, etc. But if my business is the source of someone else's livelihood, that creates an obligation towards my employee that doesn't exist if I have none.  Et cetera. Your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins. And a business inherently has a long arm.	Dragon	where	 false

I can't comprehend what more you people (or Netanyahu himself) could have wanted from Obama's speech. What, exactly, did you people want him to say about the conflict? I'm just stunned because from the speech it is entirely clear that Obama is as staunch a "supporter of Israel" as any other American president for the past 50 years. He totally and completely demolished the chances at an international recognition of the Palestinian State in the upcoming UN General Assembly. He said nothing about Jerusalem, and nothing about 7,000,000 refugees that rot in camps across the Middle East. All he did was a re-iterate a position that has been entirely standard over the entire peace process - two state solution based on 1967 borders. Nothing new. Even Israeli prime ministers have said this stuff before. He continued to talk at great length on "Israel's security" while saying nothing about Palestinian's security. OK?!  Nothing is going to happen. You can all go back to sleep and stop worrying. There will be no Palestinian state. The government of Israel will continue to operate countless checkpoints across the West Bank, it will continue to build settlements in the West Bank and operate Israeli-only highways criss-crossing the territory, it'll continue to demolish and ethnically cleanse Palestinian neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, it will continue controlling the airspace over Palestine and the shores of Gaza, the entirety of the Jordan River, all major water resource and fertile land in the West Bank. It will continue to hold Palestinian "political prisoners" like the best of it's enemies do elsewhere in the region (yes, those much more evil, much browner regimes it claims to be so far superior to), it will continue to blockade the Gaza strip in its entirety, discriminate against its Arab minority, and brutally oppress and humiliate the people of the West Bank.  OK?! AREN'T YOU ALL SO VERY HAPPY?! Go on, be happy. Because you can be. Because all you fucking slugs can sit in your nice little suburban houses with your little gardens and white picket fences watching your flat-screen TVs, because there's not a single chance that foreign occupation is going to bulldoze your little dream home, because a foreign soldier is not going to stop you on your way to work to check your papers in your own country. No, it's all well and good in the Town of Bumfuck, America especially when you can call brown people dying a half-world away savages.  But I digress - My point is to you guys, STOP WORRYING! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> You guys are just too uptight about the whole ordeal. Israel is perfectly fine and safe, ok guys? Nothing is going to happen to Israel, least of all from the Palestinians, with or without speech and with or without State. Here, let me show you, just so that you guys can sleep a little better at night:  Israel: - Nuclear Warheads - Among top 10 best militaries in the World - $13 Billion in Military Expenditures - 18th in the World - Developed Economy - $220 Billion GDP - 49th in the World - $29,000 GDP per capita - 27th in the World  Palestine: - Pop bottle rockets - Among top 10 rag-tag militias - Underdeveloped Economy - $13 Billion GDP - would be around 130th in the world - $2,900 GDP per capita - would be around 135th in the world  See?? Israel is perfectly fine! Israel is basically 20 times richer than the Palestinian Territories and Israeli's are 10 times richer than Palestinians. Their military expenditures equal the entire domestic product of the Palestinian "economy." Israel's got nukes, Hamas has pop bottle rockets. So, don't worry! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/> Israel's the one with the capabilities to destroy the West Bank and Gaza, not the other way around. So you know, it's all good! We should all be very concerned if Hamas could do shit to Israel, but since it's only Israel that could single-handedly demolish all of Palestine, then there is absolutely nothing to be concerned about! Hopefully they'll finish the job of eliminating every savage man, savage woman, and savage child in all of Palestine sooner rather than later so that all of you can be very happy and be able to flip that channel with a little more peace of mind.

It pretty much destroyed our reputation as honest brokers in the area.  If our gov't doesn't TRY to break the log jam, the I/P problem is just going to fester and worsen, and Palestinians and other Arab contries will only become MORE militant and MORE resentful of America. Does that sound like it's good for either Israel or America?  Kudos to Obama for at least TRYING to get things moving again by reasserting America as an honest broker at a time when the Arab Spring might actually work in our favor by changing the status quo while also undercutting Islamic militancy.

And in the weeks and months to come, Palestinian leaders will have to provide a credible answer to that question. "-B.Hussein Obama  PS. I wasn't using my logic when referring to Bush and Saddam/KSM, I was using liberal logic to demonstrate liberal's hypocrisy.

Either you know that and are dishonest, or you are just stupid.  </quote>  Nonsense.  The 1967 borders have been the basis of negotiations for years. What Obama AND Bush have in common is being the first president of the US to state something openly. In Bush's case, I believe he was the first president to state that the US supported an independent Palestinian State. And how did PM Sharon respond? Pretty much the same way that Netenyahu responded. Those two Israeli PMs are simply NOT serious about reaching a peace settlement, AND they are not negotiating in good faith.  Now, what does that mean? That means that the Israelis are not just jerking the Palestinians around (which only serves to make them angrier AND more militant), but they're also jerking us around by taking US aid under false pretenses AND causing our gov't to spend one hell of a lot of time trying to resolve a decades old conflict when they're not really serious. The fact that they keep expanding their settlements is proof of that.  If conservatives REALLY cared about American interests, they would support ANY American president who tried to get Israel to stop playing this dangerous game at our expense. But conservatives don't do that. And why? Because regardless of how much they say they love America, they hate Obama more.	Mustang	more	 false

Herman Cain	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8895736	Truth is we whites can get down on our knee's now until hell comes home and couldn't change a thing. The honest truth is we're not the ones that should be sorry for a thing, because we built this civilization. Yes, if it was NOT for whites coming here on our ships this land would still be full of people slaughtering each other. I've posted this in the past on this board with a question; would there be a civilization here? Would you even been born?...You have to ask your self what kind of a future do you went for your children and grand children? Do you even care...Seriously.  Seriously, I don't believe Cain is stupid; heck just the opposite, I'm impressed with his back ground, but this is not what we went to go with as our true enemy's have been working to turn this nation into a third world crap hole haven bluntly flooded our nation with the third world. They wish to destroy CIVILIZATION and the white race..Are you really freaking going to tell me being a white man or woman that whites should just fade away? WTF...We whites deserve a safe place to raise our children that's away from the rest of the third world. Our forefathers wished that...Ask your self is this what you went?  Cain is a intelligent man that has worked his way up and would do much for his people as a leader of a african nation. You surely don't find many african leaders that would do good... He might even save millions of lives and bring some hope, but Not as a leader of our nation. This is playing right into the hands of the globalist that wish to mix and wipe whites off the face of the earth. This will just lead to the end of our CIVILIZATION. In the 18th century Hati was once one of the jewls of the whole world, but we made the same mistake in were slaughtered for it(1803)...Within 30 years Briton will be a minority white nation.. You could if you could time travel NOT one period within the past 30,000 years that it was anything besides white. It is disgraceful and wrong. So is with france and most of the rest of western Europe...See my brothers and sisters we're NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN HOME TO EUROPE. We have given up the whole thing...The muslims will take europe over within 100 years...After 1,400 years of fighting. SAD.  The avg black causes 60 percent of all murder and rape throughout our nation. This is seen throughout the world from Hati, South Africa, Congo and more. There is no question this is the future we're choosing for ourselfs. Again, I'm not pointing at blacks like Herman Cain, but lets use a little honesty.  Ask your self a serious question on what kind of a future do you went, 1# One that your children and grand children will be safe with his or her people. One of high living standards, clean water, food, schooling. 2# or One that he is hated as a minority within what was once his or hers. Living behind gates in fear of being slaughtered like in most of Africa. One that he or she are murdered or raped without a single thought for his/her civil rights. People, the truth is blacks, arabs, ect never developed civil rights or human rights. They don't care...Seriously don't fucking care as a people when it comes right down to it.... A future that our very control of our own future is taken away and we're second class trash. Arabs, Mexicans or any other people won't care about us either. WE have given the house away and sold our selfs down the river.  Cain is smart and is right to stand with the right, but most of his people will never think twice about raping and killing whites in a future black city and a black future(mexican).  We will be wiped from the face of the earth. I will post this as a white that cares to see whites survive as long as there is life on this planet, but my fight appears to be failing. How the hell am I evil you have to honestly ask yourselfs? Because you believe in some globalist mixed race future that is ruled over?  I will fall on my sword to post this as this is what I believe. I don't hate anyone, but believe that we whites won't get a fair hand in the future. I understand that you and the leftist will tar me apart for believeing in anything besides globalism and one mixed race for our future. I will die before I stop. What is insults next to the pain our children and grand children may feel if our nations go the same way as Zimbabwe, South Africa, Hati 1803, Turkey after the fall of the Eastern Empire. INSULT as that is all you have...  If you think I'm so evil then ban me. I don't care.	Matthew	believe	 true

They showed a clip from a Cain interview from yesterday. He was asked why, since he lived in Atlanta, Georgia why he didn't march. He said the marchers were college students and he was in high school. It was pointed out that he was at MLK's college from 1963 to 1967, and in his 20's. He said that his father taught them not to get in trouble and they if they were told to move to the back of the bus, they moved to the back of the bus. Cain was asked what would have happened if Rosa Parks followed his father's advice, where would blacks be today? He said his father didn't give advice to Rosa Parks and at this point, became very, very angry and said, "Don't tell me how to be black".  Now this is a guy who has questioned Obama's "blackness and Americanism" and calls other blacks "brainwashed". A man who sat in the back of the bus and lied about why he wasn't "involved". MLK would would not be a Republican today. Cain received benefits he didn't earn. That much is clear.  </quote>  This post is moronic  You are insinuating that he's an Uncle Tom  I'm sick of white dems speaking for black people like you people have a clue.

Some folks set a good example and inspired others. Before the Civil Rights legislation it was damn difficult for a working class student to attend college and obtain a degree in Mathematics. Even at Morehouse, students had to be better than their white peers (at other Atlanta area colleges) just to be on the same level. For a working class black man getting a job that led to a decent career was next to impossible for years after the legislation was passed unless one was in the true upper crust of intellect.  You think Cain failed to participate in the Civil Rights movement? He was a pioneer. He stuck to the basics his father taught him and has given that same advice for decades. It worked, too.	asterism	pioneer	 false

Herman Cain	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8895736	Yes this topic has gotten off topic, and it was a ridiculous one when it was started. Some guy said he saw this interview on a tv some station where this one guy asked Herman Cain why he didn't march. Cain said he was in HS but then this guy said Cain was actually in college and then Cain said to this guy that pointed this out "don't tell me how to be black".  If this is true, the questions are charged to a certain direction and over the line. Only somebody who clearly has an axe to grind would criticize somebody for picking their battles and beating an oppressor at their own game.

Ann Coulter	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6881908	Coulter is making up this burroshit as she goes along--in the 350 years of the Inquisition, about 5000 people were executed. Her flippant remark about the "Kulaks" (a manufactured term of Stalin's) is typical of her glib insensitivity--literally millions of Russians and Ukranians died, but she would have us believe that this somehow justifies the slaughter christians have perpetrated. I notices she mentions the Inquisition (and displays her ignorance), but fails to mention the tens of thousands of people, mostly women, who were burned as "witches" by Protestants. Dime to a dollar she's Protestant herself, wanna bet on it? Charlemagne spent nearly 40 years slaughtering Saxons because they were not christians, and in one year alone his chroniclers brag that more than 5000 women and children were slain in a single incursion. The Knights of the Tuetonic Order used to hunt down Letts and other peoples of the Baltic as though they were wild animals, and they claimed to be doing God's work, because these Slavs were "pagans." During the Reconquista, the soldiers of Aragon and Castile were left free to plunder any captured city, and slaughter anyone who stood in their way, because they were Muslim, or simply because they lived in a formerly Muslim-controlled city (often, the majority of the population were christians and Jews). After the "Moors" were driven from Spain (the few survivors who were not slaughtered outright), Our Dear Isabella decreed that Jews could convert to christianity, get out of Spain, or be executed. Letting the "Tercios" plunder a city was convenient, also, because then the Queen didn't have to pay them. Her successor, Carlos, who became the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, used the same tactic in northern Italy, where the population simply happened to be in the way. As late as a century later, the Tercios were let loose in Antwerp, and because some (and by no means all) of the population were Protestant, they were given a week to murder, rape and plunder. Once again, this obviated paying them. The wars of the Reformation saw Catholic against Lutheran, and Lutheran against Calvinist, and everybody against the Anabaptists (who were accused of communal living and group sex, as well as principles of free love--the Baptists ? ! ? ! ?... puh-leeze). In France a crusade was carried out against the Albigensians, claimed to be heretics, as well as the Waldensians, who were hunted all over Europe. The Hussites might have been snuffed out, as was their inspiration, Jan Hus, had they not developed fire arms to a high degree, and taken to the road in wagon trains, which they would circle to fight off the Austrians when they were attacked.  I've left out pages of examples--christianity is one of the most blood soaked religions the world has known. That's not "liberal" propaganda, it's something called history. Every time Our Dear Annie opens her mouth, if you can understand her despite having both feet firmly lodged there, you get yet another breath-taking display of her ignorance. I no more consider the murderous excesses of the christians to be evidence of the basic moral corruption of the contemporary christian than i consider the fairy tales embodied in the New Testament to be evidence that the Jews are "Christ Killers." Coulter is an embarrassment to the journalistic profession; but, as Mencken observed, no one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.	Setanta	up	 false

Ann Coulter	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6881908	The scriptures do in fact detail the torture. They speak of 80 lashes, or was it 40? Anyway, when you actually show someone getting lashed 40 times, it's quite horrific. We are somewhat removed from this horror nowadays, but the ancient world understood it perfectly. The horror of the torture of Christ is included in the Scriptures, but they don't display it out in all its gore. But if you pay attention to every single last detail offered, and turn it into full-length images, you get what Gibson created.  The Bible would offend all kinds of people if every last detail was put into accurate imagery. Sex, lust, greed, adultery, gluttony, bestiality, all of the dark side of human nature is crammed into it. The words alone don't make it totally obvious, but when you turn them into accurate images based on the words, you get rated R and then some. Hell, revelation alone terrified me when I was a little kid reading the Bible when no one was prompting me to do so. Hell, I used to know a guy that crashed in life, and then read the Bible obsessively cover to cover without let up, then he killed himself. I'm not sure why, but it's an unusal response, don't you think?  Jesus could have fled the Garden of Gethsamane to avoid what came afterwards. He knew they were coming for him. But he didn't, and submitted to the tortures they inflicted on him to demonstrate that key Christian tenet of sacrificing yourself to save others. It doesn't have much to do with the Jews at all beyond their abandonment of him once Caiaphas starting strutting around. Pilate didn't want to kill Jesus, but the rabblerousers insisted on it. If anyone is to blame, it is Caiaphas, but one Jew does not a people make.	Umbagog	Hell	 false

He is a man of some national prominence, a liberal who is not afraid of taking on conservatives directly. The phone message at his national office is personable and friendly. He is a regular guest on Morning Joe and is not shy about appearing anywhere. His national prominence dwarfs mine of course.  As of this moment 10:03 a.m. EST he has over 45K followers (45737 to be exact) I'm not one of them. He also follows only 194 people.  Until 48 hours ago one of those people was Gennette Noble the young lady who is at the center of this interesting event.  Just to remind you. Gennette Noble is a 21-year-old college student in Seattle Washington. She writes for the college newspaper. She seems a fairly attractive young girl and until 24 hours ago I knew absolutely nothing about her. I doubt many people on the net did. It would be fair to say that her prominence compared to me is of the same proportion of my prominence compared to Joe Scarborough.  Yet until 48 hours ago she was one of the under 200 people Congressman Wiener followed on Twitter.  Runt that through your head for a second.  In the last 24 hours her facebook account has disappeared. Her twitter account have disappeared. Her byline has disappeared from college papers.

Anthony Weiner	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888981	More analysis of Weinergate:  In fact, on his Twitter account, Weiner appeared to dissemble and bumble about for over an hour before firing off the tweet about his Facebook account being hacked.

Reportedly, the young woman the lewd photograph was sent to lives in  Seattle.  Also missing from the NY Posts story is an explanation for how a hacking of Weiners Facebook account could lead to a Yfrog image being posted in his public Twitter feed.

"Do you sense there is some large mass of dark matter, an unseen Scandal Star, the gravitational pull of which is warping the coverage of what seems, on the surface, a pretty dull presidential race? I do. So does Ron Rosenbaum. I thought the Dark Star was the Edwards affair allegation. But Rosenbaum says "everyone in the elite Mainstream media" knows about another juicy scandal that the LAT is supposedly sitting on. I guess this is proof that Im not in the elite, because I dont know what hes talking about.  My vestigial Limbaugh gland tells me it must involve a Democrat, or else the Times would have found a reason to print it.  P.S.: If its just Richardson, that will be very disappointing.  Im placing my money on the lesbian-Hillary angle.  If you examine the candidates connected by the gossip columnists to current sex scandals, Hillary leads the way with her Huma connection (and Bill with his connections).  Within a couple of hours of reading Mickey Kauss report above, I blitzed more than 30 sources (most of them journalists) for what they know about this matter. None of them could identify the purported LA Times story.  My dialogue with my sources left me with no doubt Tuesday night (Oct. 30) that Hillarys made passes at women and that Muslim Huma Abedin is Hillarys most likely source of romantic and sexual love." <a href="http://lukeford.net/blog/?p=1031">Hillary &amp; Huma  A Dark Unseen Scandal Star?</a>  2. My dialogue with my sources left me with no doubt Tuesday night (Oct. 30) that Hillary's made passes at women and that Muslim Huma Abedin is Hillary's most likely source of romantic and sexual love.  Michelle Cottle writes in the Aug. 13, 2007 New York magazine: "Huma Abedin, Hillary's beautiful, enigmatic "body person," spends nearly every waking minute with Hillary and so has the best sense of her daily rhythms and routines."  Even if the Ron Rosenbaum report is complete nonsense (as LAT's editorial assistant editor Matt Welch asserts below), the mainstream media will come under increasing pressure (as Hillary waltzes to the Democratic nomination and assumes front runner status in the general election) to probe Hillary's love life (or lack of it) and to examine the numerous assertions (by such persons as Dick Morris, Edward Klein, etc) that she bats for the other team.  Like the rest of us, Hillary needs love. Unlike the rest of us, Hillary is powerful enough to get what she wants.  Like any woman, Hillary needs hugs and comfort and solace. She's not had that regularly from Bill for many years. Where's it coming from? Huma is the source that makes the most sense." <a href="http://www.lukeford.net/profiles/profiles/huma_abedin.htm">Huma Abedin - Hillary Clinton's personal assistant</a>  3. From the Michael Musto gossip column linked in the above article:  As I recently said on MONICA CROWLEYs radio show, whisper campaigns are claiming that HILLARY CLINTON is GAYLE KINGing her aide de camp, the glamorous HUMA ABEDIN, an Indian/Pakistani goddess from Kalamazoo, Michigan. In other words, Hillary may be putting Huma out there in the press and purposely making her more visible as a pre-emptive strike that amounts to her hiding in plain sight. This way, no Republican can later say, "Who is this gorgeous babe who spends so much intimate time with Hillary that the Observer called her Hills body person? Was GENNIFER FLOWERSs book right about Hillarys sexual taste?" And does either of this couple have the balls to bottom?  4. Now, does this destroy the original Weiner story? And if the Hillary-Huma story is true, why should a good ol' Democrat hide it?  Or...is this another vast right wing conspiracy?	PoliticalChic	Abedin	 false

When one messages on twitter, it can be public or private; easy to make a mistake. Oddly enough, she was one of his links out of 91; so he could private chat with her.

Anthony Weiner	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888981	Again, the impeachment process has nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of the actual crime. It only deals with the impeaching for possible removal  Many hold onto the non-removal from office as complete and full "legal proof" of his innocence or complete and full proof on being "not guilty". It does neither; his non-removal only show that the level of crime he was impeached for, is not enough for removal, according to Senate at the time.  If fact, it could be possible for a president to be removed from office and then later found not guilty in the actual criminal proceedings. Wouldn't that be a political mess even if it was due to a legal technicality like a hung jury or evidence issues.  <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/19/clinton.lewinsky/index.html">CNN:</a>  Clinton admits misleading testimony, avoids charges in Lewinsky probe <a href="http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/William_J._Clinton">President Clinton</a> will leave office free of the prospect of criminal charges after he admitted Friday that he knowingly gave misleading testimony about his affair with <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/588/000025513/">Monica Lewinsky</a> in a 1998 lawsuit.

Anthony Weiner	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888981	Weiner has lawyered up. Apparently, if one's facebook-twitter-yfrog account trifecta are hacked, the appropriate response is to hire a lawyer as opposed to reporting the crime to the proper authorities.  Who knew?  A spokesman for Rep. Anthony Weiner, New York Democrat, told The Daily Caller the congressman's team has “retained counsel” and is exploring the “proper next steps” after his official Twitter account posted a picture of a man's erect penis underneath gray boxer shorts.  The Internet-driven scandal has come to be known online as “#Weinergate,” a pun on the Congressman's last name.  “We've retained counsel to explore the proper next steps and to advise us on what civil or criminal actions should be taken,” Weiner spokesman Dave Arnold said in an email. “This was a prank. We are loath to treat it as more, but we are relying on professional advice.”  Weiner maintains that he thinks the issue is a distraction started and driven by conservatives. “At a time when the GOP is playing games with the debt limit, a member of the Supreme Court is refusing to recuse himself from matters he has a financial interest in, and middle class incomes are stagnant, many want to change the subject. I don't,” Weiner said in an email to TheDC. “This was a prank, and a silly one. I'm focused on my work.”  Read more: <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2011/05/30/weiner-spokesman-we%e2%80%99ve-retained-counsel-to-explore-possible-civil-or-criminal-actions/#ixzz1Nx9BW7k7">Weinergate | Retained Counsel | Anthony Weiner | The Daily Caller</a>  And now he's using the old ruse of just wanting to focus on his work (an update of the old Clinton "fighting for you").	boedicca	lawyered	 false

Anthony Weiner	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181103-8888981	Here's a good summary of the timeline so far for WeinerGate:  For MSM types who wish to start covering Weinergate accurately, or for readers just catching up, heres a quick primer on the undisputed Weinergate facts.  On Friday night, New York Democrat Rep. Anthony Weiners twitter feed sent 21-year-old college student Gennette Nicole Cordova, a Seattle resident, a tweet containing a link to a lewd photo of a man in his briefs. Weiner followed Cordova on twitter, and Cordova followed Weiner on twitter. At the time of the lewd tweet, Weiner had about 45,000 twitter followers but he followed just 91 people, and Cordova was among them. This two-way following relationship allows twitter users to send messages directly to one another without such messages going on either users public twitter feeds. Weiner deleted the tweet with the link to the photo four minutes after it went out on his public twitter feeds, and claimed he was hacked, blaming the lewd photo on the hacker. The link that appeared in Weiners public twitter feed led to the photo on Weiners yfrog account. The photo has also been removed.  Here is a rough Weinergate timeline. If you see errors or items that need clarification, hit me up in comments or email and Ill correct or clarifiy anything that needs it.  1. Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-NY) was very active on twitter on Friday, awaiting a financial disclosure from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a disclosure that Weiner intended to turn into a political attack on Thomas.  2. Weiners twitter feed goes silent for about 3 hours, 24 minutes Friday afternoon/evening, a time during which he is allegedly watching a hockey game. (Weiners spokesman later claimed that he had been tweeting about the hockey game during that time, a claim that has turned out to be false.)..  (more at the link)	boedicca	feeds	 false

Help Me Bring the Weiner Hacker to Justice  I have never been much of a community activist, but I can no longer sit idly while America remains at risk of attack by the most nefarious identity thief in the history of Internet. And cheap page views are to be had.  The Weinergate facts, as we so far know them: on May 28, @RepWeiner, the verified Twitter account of US Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY), posted a tweet of a y.frog photo of a slightly-built white male straining to pitch a pup tent in a pair of grey Hanes Underoos. Within seconds, Congressman Weiner arrived at the scene of the cybercrime and instantly recognized it as the work of a hacker who had simultaneously broken into his Twitter, Facebook and y.frog accounts. Working quickly, and without regard to his own safety, Congressman Weiner used his elite law school-honed internet security coding skills to wrest back control of his accounts, delete the offending tweet and photo, as well as unfollow a Seattle coed to whom it was sent. His Twitter perimeter once again secured, the intrepid Congressmen sent out a new tweet explaining how he was victimized by an Internet criminal mastermind.  (snip)  I say no - we cannot as an online community let this tragic crime go unpunished. That it why I am announcing the Weiner Hacker Prize Fund to award a generous bounty for information leading to the arrest, prosecution and conviction of Pubic Enemy #1 - the pervert who stole Congressman Weiner's underpants identity. To get things rolling, I will seed it with $1000 of my own personal 2010 federal tax refund. I am leaving the comments section on this post open for anyone who would like to add their own contribution to the bounty, as well as tips and clues to pass on to law enforcement officials. Please though - do not interfere with any official crime investigation. Let's leave the detective work to hardboiled gumshoes like Jim Treacher and Ace of Spades.  So let's get involved and work to get this mysterious criminal off our online streets. Until he is brought to justice, remember: You May Already Be a Weiner....	boedicca	Iowahawk	 false

He later said his account was hacked.  Weiner, wearing a coat but no tie, gave a variation of the same answer to multiple questions, including why he hired a lawyer and hasnt asked law enforcement to investigate his allegations of fraudulent access to his account.  Ive put out a couple statements over the last couple days.

After President Obamas official Twitter account was hacked, the FBI managed to track the hacker all the way to France, where he was tried and convicted. If Weiners account was compromised, theres a good chance that law enforcement will find the person who did it.  But if it turns out that Weiner is unwilling to allow an official, transparent investigation, then he cant expect journalists to stop digging for the truth on their own. After all, the public has legitimate questions, and the media is only doing its job. Rumor in the collective is that he has Willie, Wood, Johnson &amp; Schwanz as legal counsel....

Ben Roethlisberger	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181137-9036584	Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger suffered a serious head injury this morning after his motorcycle collided with a car on Second Avenue near the 10th Street Bridge, police said.  Roethlisberger, 24, who was not wearing a helmet, collided with a Chrysler New Yorker shortly before 11:25 a.m. and was thrown off his motorcycle, flying head-first into the car's windshield "with a pretty good force," said a veteran city police officer.  Roethlisberger was talking and moving his arms and legs after the accident. He suffered injuries to his face and lost several teeth, according to city firefighters.  The injured quarterback was taken to Mercy Hospital, said a Steelers spokesman, who declined to provide other information.  The car, which has Maine license plates, was heading west on Second Avenue and was turning left onto the 10th Street Bridge. Roethlisberger was driving east on Second Avenue riding a Suzuki Hayabusa and collided with the car at the intersection of the bridge and the Armstrong Tunnels.  Roethlisberger, who led the Steelers to a Super Bowl championship this year, slammed into the windshield, rolled over the car and landed on the pavement, striking his head again, said a woman who witnessed the accident.  The witness, who declined to give her name, asked Roethlisberger several times if he was OK. He eventually replied, "My name is Ben."  He asked: "Where am I?"  "You're at the Armstrong Tunnel," the witness said.  "What city is that in?" he said.  "Pittsburgh," the woman replied.  Roethlisberger fell silent for about a minute and then tried to stand up.  "I'm OK," he said.  "No you're not," said the woman, who instructed him to stay still.  Pittsburgh homicide detectives are investigating the accident, which is standard procedure when critical injuries are involved, said city police Lt. Kevin Kraus.  Roethlisberger's 2005 Suzuki Hayabusa, which is named after a Japanese bird of prey, was totaled. The front wheel was broken in half. The handle bars were broken. The left pedal was shattered. The 170-horsepower bike, which weighs 500 pounds fully loaded, was targeted by law enforcement agencies worldwide after its 1998 debut because it could reach a top speed of 189 mph.  Suzuki Motorcycles of North America gave Roethlisberger the bike as part of a promotional deal in exchange for him appearing at several Suzuki dealerships in the area, including Andrews Cycle in Salem, Ohio where he picked up the motorcycle last summer. Andrews' sales staff declined comment.  The motorcycle is popular among first-time buyers, said Steve Stiller, a salesman at Northgate Motorcycles in Cranberry, Butler County.  Roethlisberger has said in the past that he prefers not to wear a helmet when riding his motorcycle. He has pointed out Pennsylvania's 35-year-old state law requiring helmets to be worn was amended to make helmets optional.  In May 2005, Steelers coach Bill Cowher lectured Roethlisberger on the dangers of riding without a helmet.  "He talked about being a risktaker and I'm not really a risktaker. I'm pretty conservative and laid back, but the big thing is to just be careful," Roethlisberger said at the time. "I'll just continue to be careful. I told him we don't ever ride alone, we always ride in a group of people, and I think it makes it even more safe."  Earlier this year, Roethlisberger led the Steelers to the NFL title, giving the team the fifth Super Bowl win they had been chasing since 1980.	GotZoom	suffered	 false

Ben Roethlisberger	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181137-9036584	More from the same link; updated story:  Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is in serious but stable condition and underwent surgery following a serious head injury he suffered this morning when his motorcycle collided with a car on Second Avenue near the 10th Street Bridge, police said.  Roethlisberger lost most of his teeth, fractured his left sinus cavity bone, suffered a nine-inch laceration to the back of his head and a broken jaw, and injured both of his knees when he hit the ground, police said.  "He is right now in the (operating room) undergoing some surgery from injuries he received in this accident today," said  Dr. Larry Jones, chief of trauma and burns at Mercy Hospital, Uptown. "He was talking to me before he left for the OR. He's coherent. He's making sense. He knows what happened."  Roethlisberger, 24, who was not wearing a helmet, collided with a Chrysler New Yorker at 11:15 a.m. and was thrown off his motorcycle, flying head-first into the car's windshield "with a pretty good force," said a veteran city police officer.  Roethlisberger was talking and moving his arms and legs after the accident.  The car, which has Maine license plates, was heading west on Second Avenue and was turning left onto the 10th Street Bridge. Roethlisberger was driving east on Second Avenue riding a Suzuki Hayabusa and collided with the car at the intersection of the bridge and the Armstrong Tunnels.  The 62-year-old woman driving the car, who maintains residences in Maine and Squirrel Hill, escaped serious injury, police said.  In May 2005, Cleveland Browns tight end Kellen Winslow Jr. tore knee ligaments in a motorcycle accident and was lost for the season.  Roethlisberger continued to ride after Winslow's accident, and that angered Terry Bradshaw, who quarterbacked the Steelers to four Super Bowl victories during the 1970s.  Visiting the Steelers' training camp last summer, Bradshaw remarked: "Ride it when you retire."  Earlier this year, Roethlisberger led the Steelers to the NFL title, giving the team the fifth Super Bowl win they had been chasing since 1980.  <img src="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/photos/2006-06-12/2006-06-12_benmap-a.jpg"/>	GotZoom	fractured	 false

I hope he isn't arrogant and claim it was the driver and not the helmet issue.  I agree with Bradshaw who supposedly told him to lose the bike until after his career.	jimnyc	lucky	 false

Blatham is fixed on the evils of corporations and Republican government in the United States. (Perhaps the Canadian - or French -- versions of both are beyond reproach.) He trots out the standard litany of left-wing diatribes against the United Fruit Company and the evils done by it and the U.S. government to the hapless peasants of Guatemala (who, left to themselves, were clearly on the verge of creating a prosperous democratic paradise), as evidence of the need to suppress such evils through the adoption of more powers in the hands of government which he presumably would populate with Platonic philosopher kings.  Thomas responds, noting the mixed bag of good and evil done at the hands of both government and corporations, acknowledging the zealotry of some religious right, but noting that it is often no worse than other ubiquitous sources of that commodity. In various ways, he suggests that he rejects formulaic authoritarian answers and prefers instead the free markets of individual choice in economic and political life: even though they too create or tolerate some undesirable things, they do so generally less than the alternatives. George, silently applauds (OK, not silently).  Neither Blatham nor Lola has offered any reliable - or believable - means to the achievement of the ends implied in their criticisms. After they wipe out right wing Christians, Neocons, most U.S. corporations, and (presumably) the Republican Party, what next? Will crime, conflict, and suffering cease? Will the authoritarian structures required in accomplishing all this, themselves, remain immune to bad action or intent? Surely Aesop had something to say about this.  .	georgeob1	applauds	 false

How this for a description?  <img src="http://www.strangecosmos.com/images/picturejokes/3904.jpg"/>  Found this revealing article on him also: "Michael Moore: Class Clown" Link: <a href="http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=11470">http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=11470</a>  Excerpts:  "Those willing to call themselves "liberals" in these 2002 exit polls shrank to only 17 percent  roughly one voter in six  while conservatives increased to include more than one voter in three.  Moores self-deluded book has spent the past 10 weeks on the liberal New York Times Nonfiction Bestseller List (bumped down to #4 this week by fellow Lefty Al Frankens competing anti-American screed). But, truth be told, a Politically Correct author can climb this list with only a few thousand book sales in the right (that is, the Left) bookstores. The larger question with this, as with all of Michael Moores books and film "documentaries," is whether they should be listed as Nonfiction or as fiction.  Moore faces what Karl Marx called internal contradictions. If the nation were as Leftist as he claims, his book would be nothing more than a simpleton repetition of common beliefs......  But Moore knows that his fellow Americans elected Republicans to run the Senate, House and White House and are likely to do so again in 2004. The aim of his latest propaganda polemic is to rationalize and then reverse this, to achieve "regime change" in the United States.  Americans vote Republican, contrary to their own self-interest, writes Moore, because wealthy capitalist oil men have hypnotized them with an illegitimate war in Iraq, fear of terrorists, and a few crumbs from a tax cut (given mostly to the wealthy) that feeds the American Horatio Alger myth that we all can succeed.  "Horatio Alger Must Die," writes Moore. Americans should stop trying to become rich. Instead they should desert the War on Terror and enlist in the Class War. Our best chance for a halfway pleasant life, he argues, is to tax all wealth away from the rich and redistribute it to ourselves in the form of welfare, government healthcare and other benefits.  "You are never going to be rich" like Horatio Alger, writes Moore. "The chance of that happening is about one in a million." (This means that in our nation of 293 million people, we have only 293 millionaires.when in fact we have literally millions of citizens with a net worth in excess of a million dollars  and would have millions more if government greed and excessive taxation could be endedbut is it fair to apply logic to an utterly irrational hyper-Leftist ideologue like Moore?)  The problem with this pudgy messenger born 49 years ago into a working class family in Flint, Michigan, is that Michael Moore IS that one in a million who, in the jargon of Leftspeak, "won lifes lottery."......  But Michael Moore is very secretive about his own private life and how many dollars he makes. The amount of his income might be embarrassing to this foe of capitalism. Somebody might ask how this self-proclaimed champion of the proletariat justifies keeping, after taxes, millions and millions of dollars for himself instead of giving it all to the poor. Or some fellow socialist might ask why Moore takes this tax cut at all instead of telling the big government he loves so much to keep the money, government being so much better at spending our money than we are.  "Michael Moore would never withstand the scrutiny he lays on other people," says his former manager Douglas Urbanski. "You would think that hes the ultimate common man. But hes money-obsessed."...."

Michael Moore	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3142027	Below is an article that was originally published in the Independent. However it has now receeded into the paper's online pay article. Fortunately i found it on several websites.  ---------  All the President's Votes? A Quiet Revolution is Taking Place in US Politics. By the Time It's Over, the Integrity of Elections Will be in the Unchallenged, Unscrutinized Control of a Few Large - and Pro-Republican - Corporations. Andrew Gumbel wonders if democracy in America can survive  by Andrew Gumbel  Something very odd happened in the mid-term elections in Georgia last November. On the eve of the vote, opinion polls showed Roy Barnes, the incumbent Democratic governor, leading by between nine and 11 points. In a somewhat closer, keenly watched Senate race, polls indicated that Max Cleland, the popular Democrat up for re-election, was ahead by two to five points against his Republican challenger, Saxby Chambliss.  Those figures were more or less what political experts would have expected in state with a long tradition of electing Democrats to statewide office. But then the results came in, and all of Georgia appeared to have been turned upside down. Barnes lost the governorship to the Republican, Sonny Perdue, 46 per cent to 51 per cent, a swing of as much as 16 percentage points from the last opinion polls. Cleland lost to Chambliss 46 per cent to 53, a last-minute swing of 9 to 12 points.  Red-faced opinion pollsters suddenly had a lot of explaining to do and launched internal investigations. Political analysts credited the upset - part of a pattern of Republican successes around the country - to a huge campaigning push by President Bush in the final days of the race. They also said that Roy Barnes had lost because of a surge of "angry white men" punishing him for eradicating all but a vestige of the old confederate symbol from the state flag.  But something about these explanations did not make sense, and they have made even less sense over time. When the Georgia secretary of state's office published its demographic breakdown of the election earlier this year, it turned out there was no surge of angry white men; in fact, the only subgroup showing even a modest increase in turnout was black women.  There were also big, puzzling swings in partisan loyalties in different parts of the state. In 58 counties, the vote was broadly in line with the primary election. In 27 counties in Republican-dominated north Georgia, however, Max Cleland unaccountably scored 14 percentage points higher than he had in the primaries. And in 74 counties in the Democrat south, Saxby Chambliss garnered a whopping 22 points more for the Republicans than the party as a whole had won less than three months earlier.  Now, weird things like this do occasionally occur in elections, and the figures, on their own, are not proof of anything except statistical anomalies worthy of further study. But in Georgia there was an extra reason to be suspicious. Last November, the state became the first in the country to conduct an election entirely with touchscreen voting machines, after lavishing $54m (£33m) on a new system that promised to deliver the securest, most up-to-date, most voter-friendly election in the history of the republic. The machines, however, turned out to be anything but reliable. With academic studies showing the Georgia touchscreens to be poorly programmed, full of security holes and prone to tampering, and with thousands of similar machines from different companies being introduced at high speed across the country, computer voting may, in fact, be US democracy's own 21st-century nightmare.  In many Georgia counties last November, the machines froze up, causing long delays as technicians tried to reboot them. In heavily Democratic Fulton County, in downtown Atlanta, 67 memory cards from the voting machines went missing, delaying certification of the results there for 10 days. In neighboring DeKalb County, 10 memory cards were unaccounted for; they were later recovered from terminals that had supposedly broken down and been taken out of service.  It is still unclear exactly how results from these missing cards were tabulated, or if they were counted at all. And we will probably never know, for a highly disturbing reason. The vote count was not conducted by state elections officials, but by the private company that sold Georgia the voting machines in the first place, under a strict trade-secrecy contract that made it not only difficult but actually illegal - on pain of stiff criminal penalties - for the state to touch the equipment or examine the proprietary software to ensure the machines worked properly. There was not even a paper trail to follow up. The machines were fitted with thermal printing devices that could theoretically provide a written record of voters' choices, but these were not activated. Consequently, recounts were impossible. Had Diebold Inc, the manufacturer, been asked to review the votes, all it could have done was program the computers to spit out the same data as before, flawed or not.  Astonishingly, these are the terms under which America's top three computer voting machine manufacturers - Diebold, Sequoia and Election Systems and Software (ES&amp;S) - have sold their products to election officials around the country. Far from questioning the need for rigid trade secrecy and the absence of a paper record, secretaries of state and their technical advisers - anxious to banish memories of the hanging chad fiasco and other associated disasters in the 2000 presidential recount in Florida - have, for the most part, welcomed the touchscreen voting machines as a technological miracle solution.  Georgia was not the only state last November to see big last-minute swings in voting patterns. There were others in Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois and New Hampshire - all in races that had been flagged as key partisan battlegrounds, and all won by the Republican Party. Again, this was widely attributed to the campaigning efforts of President Bush and the demoralization of a Democratic Party too timid to speak out against the looming war in Iraq.  Strangely, however, the pollsters made no comparable howlers in lower-key races whose outcome was not seriously contested. Another anomaly, perhaps. What, then, is one to make of the fact that the owners of the three major computer voting machines are all prominent Republican Party donors? Or of a recent political fund-raising letter written to Ohio Republicans by Walden O'Dell, Diebold's chief executive, in which he said he was "committed to helping Ohio to deliver its electoral votes to the president next year" - even as his company was bidding for the contract on the state's new voting machinery?  Alarmed and suspicious, a group of Georgia citizens began to look into last November's election to see whether there was any chance the results might have been deliberately or accidentally manipulated. Their research proved unexpectedly, and disturbingly, fruitful.  First, they wanted to know if the software had undergone adequate checking. Under state and federal law, all voting machinery and component parts must be certified before use in an election. So an Atlanta graphic designer called Denis Wright wrote to the secretary of state's office for a copy of the certification letter. Clifford Tatum, assistant director of legal affairs for the election division, wrote back: "We have determined that no records exist in the Secretary of State's office regarding a certification letter from the lab certifying the version of software used on Election Day." Mr Tatum said it was possible the relevant documents were with Gary Powell, an official at the Georgia Technology Authority, so campaigners wrote to him as well. Mr Powell responded he was "not sure what you mean by the words 'please provide written certification documents' ".  "If the machines were not certified, then right there the election was illegal," Mr Wright says. The secretary of state's office has yet to demonstrate anything to the contrary. The investigating citizens then considered the nature of the software itself. Shortly after the election, a Diebold technician called Rob Behler came forward and reported that, when the machines were about to be shipped to Georgia polling stations in the summer of 2002, they performed so erratically that their software had to be amended with a last-minute "patch". Instead of being transmitted via disk - a potentially time-consuming process, especially since its author was in Canada, not Georgia - the patch was posted, along with the entire election software package, on an open-access FTP, or file transfer protocol site, on the internet.  That, according to computer experts, was a violation of the most basic of security precautions, opening all sorts of possibilities for the introduction of rogue or malicious code. At the same time, however, it gave campaigners a golden opportunity to circumvent Diebold's own secrecy demands and see exactly how the system worked. Roxanne Jekot, a computer programmer with 20 years' experience, and an occasional teacher at Lanier Technical College northeast of Atlanta, did a line-by-line review and found "enough to stand your hair on end".  "There were security holes all over it," she says, "from the most basic display of the ballot on the screen all the way through the operating system." Although the program was designed to be run on the Windows 2000 NT operating system, which has numerous safeguards to keep out intruders, Ms Jekot found it worked just fine on the much less secure Windows 98; the 2000 NT security features were, as she put it, "nullified".  Also embedded in the software were the comments of the programmers working on it. One described what he and his colleagues had just done as "a gross hack". Elsewhere was the remark: "This doesn't really work." "Not a confidence builder, would you say?" Ms Jekot says. "They were operating in panic mode, cobbling together something that would work for the moment, knowing that at some point they would have to go back to figure out how to make it work more permanently." She found some of the code downright suspect - for example, an overtly meaningless instruction to divide the number of write-in votes by 1. "From a logical standpoint there is absolutely no reason to do that," she says. "It raises an immediate red flag."  Mostly, though, she was struck by the shoddiness of much of the programming. "I really expected to have some difficulty reviewing the source code because it would be at a higher level than I am accustomed to," she says. "In fact, a lot of this stuff looked like the homework my first-year students might have turned in." Diebold had no specific comment on Ms Jekot's interpretations, offering only a blanket caution about the complexity of election systems "often not well understood by individuals with little real-world experience".  But Ms Jekot was not the only one to examine the Diebold software and find it lacking. In July, a group of researchers from the Information Security Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore discovered what they called "stunning flaws". These included putting the password in the source code, a basic security no-no; manipulating the voter smart-card function so one person could cast more than one vote; and other loopholes that could theoretically allow voters' ballot choices to be altered without their knowledge, either on the spot or by remote access.  Diebold issued a detailed response, saying that the Johns Hopkins report was riddled with false assumptions, inadequate information and "a multitude of false conclusions". Substantially similar findings, however, were made in a follow-up study on behalf of the state of Maryland, in which a group of computer security experts catalogued 328 software flaws, 26 of them critical, putting the whole system "at high risk of compromise". "If these vulnerabilities are exploited, significant impact could occur on the accuracy, integrity, and availability of election results," their report says.  Ever since the Johns Hopkins study, Diebold has sought to explain away the open FTP file as an old, incomplete version of its election package. The claim cannot be independently verified, because of the trade-secrecy agreement, and not everyone is buying it. "It is documented throughout the code who changed what and when. We have the history of this program from 1996 to 2002," Ms Jekot says. "I have no doubt this is the software used in the elections." Diebold now says it has upgraded its encryption and password features - but only on its Maryland machines.  A key security question concerned compatibility with Microsoft Windows, and Ms Jekot says just three programmers, all of them senior Diebold executives, were involved in this aspect of the system. One of these, Diebold's vice-president of research and development, Talbot Iredale, wrote an e-mail in April 2002 - later obtained by the campaigners - making it clear that he wanted to shield the operating system from Wylie Labs, an independent testing agency involved in the early certification process.  The reason that emerges from the e-mail is that he wanted to make the software compatible with WinCE 3.0, an operating system used for handhelds and PDAs; in other words, a system that could be manipulated from a remote location. "We do not want Wyle [sic] reviewing and certifying the operating systems," the e-mail reads. "Therefore can we keep to a minimum the references to the WinCE 3.0 operating system."  In an earlier intercepted e-mail, this one from Ken Clark in Diebold's research and development department, the company explained upfront to another independent testing lab that the supposedly secure software system could be accessed without a password, and its contents easily changed using the Microsoft Access program Mr Clark says he had considered putting in a password requirement to stop dealers and customers doing "stupid things", but that the easy access had often "got people out of a bind". Astonishingly, the representative from the independent testing lab did not see anything wrong with this and granted certification to the part of the software program she was inspecting - a pattern of lackadaisical oversight that was replicated all the way to the top of the political chain of command in Georgia, and in many other parts of the country.  Diebold has not contested the authenticity of the e-mails, now openly accessible on the internet. However, Diebold did caution that, as the e-mails were taken from a Diebold Election systems website in March 2003 by an illegal hack, the nature of the information stolen could have been revised or manipulated.  There are two reasons why the United States is rushing to overhaul its voting systems. The first is the Florida débâcle in the Bush-Gore election; no state wants to be the center of that kind of attention again. And the second is the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), signed by President Bush last October, which promises an unprecedented $3.9bn (£2.3bn) to the states to replace their old punchcard-and-lever machines. However, enthusiasm for the new technology seems to be motivated as much by a bureaucratic love of spending as by a love of democratic accountability. According to Rebecca Mercuri, a research fellow at Harvard's John F Kennedy School of Government and a specialist in voting systems, the shockingly high error rate of punchcard machines (3-5 per cent in Florida in 2000) has been known to people in the elections business for years. It was only after it became public knowledge in the last presidential election that anybody felt moved to do anything about it.  The problem is, computer touchscreen machines and other so-called DRE (direct recording electronic) systems are significantly less reliable than punchcards, irrespective of their vulnerability to interference. In a series of research papers for the Voting Technology Project, a joint venture of the prestigious Massachusetts and California Institutes of Technology, DREs were found to be among the worst performing systems. No method, the MIT/CalTech study conceded, worked more reliably than hand-counting paper ballots - an option that US electoral officials seem to consider hopelessly antiquated, or at least impractical in elections combining multiple local, state and national races for offices from President down to dogcatcher.  The clear disadvantages and dangers associated with DREs have not deterred state and county authorities from throwing themselves headlong into touchscreen technology. More than 40,000 machines made by Diebold alone are already in use in 37 states, and most are touchscreens. County after county is poised to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more on computer voting before next spring's presidential primaries. "They say this is the direction they have to go in to have fair elections, but the rush to go towards computerization is very dubious," Dr Mercuri says. "One has to wonder why this is going on, because the way it is set up it takes away the checks and balances we have in a democratic society. That's the whole point of paper trails and recounts."  Anyone who has struggled with an interactive display in a museum knows how dodgy touchscreens can be. If they don't freeze, they easily become misaligned, which means they can record the wrong data. In Dallas, during early voting before last November's election, people found that no matter how often they tried to press a Democrat button, the Republican candidate's name would light up. After a court hearing, Diebold agreed to take down 18 machines with apparent misalignment problems. "And those were the ones where you could visually spot a problem," Dr Mercuri says. "What about what you don't see? Just because your vote shows up on the screen for the Democrats, how do you know it is registering inside the machine for the Democrats?"  Other problems have shown up periodically: machines that register zero votes, or machines that indicate voters coming to the polling station but not voting, even when a single race with just two candidates was on the ballot. Dr Mercuri was part of a lawsuit in Palm Beach County in which she and other plaintiffs tried to have a suspect Sequoia machine examined, only to run up against the brick wall of the trade-secret agreement. "It makes it really hard to show their product has been tampered with," she says, "if it's a felony to inspect it."  As for the possibilities of foul play, Dr Mercuri says they are virtually limitless. "There are literally hundreds of ways to do this," she says. "There are hundreds of ways to embed a rogue series of commands into the code and nobody would ever know because the nature of programming is so complex. The numbers would all tally perfectly." Tampering with an election could be something as simple as a "denial-of-service" attack, in which the machines simply stop working for an extended period, deterring voters faced with the prospect of long lines. Or it could be done with invasive computer codes known in the trade by such nicknames as "Trojan horses" or "Easter eggs". Detecting one of these, Dr Mercuri says, would be almost impossible unless the investigator knew in advance it was there and how to trigger it. Computer researcher Theresa Hommel, who is alarmed by touchscreen systems, has constructed a simulated voting machine in which the same candidate always wins, no matter what data you put in. She calls her model the Fraud-o-matic, and it is available online at <a href="http://www.wheresthepaper.org.">www.wheresthepaper.org.</a>  It is not just touchscreens which are at risk from error or malicious intrusion. Any computer system used to tabulate votes is vulnerable. An optical scan of ballots in Scurry County, Texas, last November erroneously declared a landslide victory for the Republican candidate for county commissioner; a subsequent hand recount showed that the Democrat had in fact won. In Comal County, Texas, a computerized optical scan found that three different candidates had won their races with exactly 18,181 votes. There was no recount or investigation, even though the coincidence, with those recurring 1s and 8s, looked highly suspicious. In heavily Democrat Broward County, Florida - which had switched to touchscreens in the wake of the hanging chad furore - more than 100,000 votes were found to have gone "missing" on election day. The votes were reinstated, but the glitch was not adequately explained. One local official blamed it on a "minor software thing".  Most suspect of all was the governor's race in Alabama, where the incumbent Democrat, Don Siegelman, was initially declared the winner. Sometime after midnight, when polling station observers and most staff had gone home, the probate judge responsible for elections in rural Baldwin County suddenly "discovered" that Mr Siegelman had been awarded 7,000 votes too many. In a tight election, the change was enough to hand victory to his Republican challenger, Bob Riley. County officials talked vaguely of a computer tabulation error, or a lightning strike messing up the machines, but the real reason was never ascertained because the state's Republican attorney general refused to authorize a recount or any independent ballot inspection.  According to an analysis by James Gundlach, a sociology professor at Auburn University in Alabama, the result in Baldwin County was full of wild deviations from the statistical norms established both by this and preceding elections. And he adds: "There is simply no way that electronic vote counting can produce two sets of results without someone using computer programs in ways that were not intended. In other words, the fact that two sets of results were reported is sufficient evidence in and of itself that the vote tabulation process was compromised." Although talk of voting fraud quickly subsided, Alabama has now amended its election laws to make recounts mandatory in close races.  The possibility of flaws in the electoral process is not something that gets discussed much in the United States. The attitude seems to be: we are the greatest democracy in the world, so the system must be fair. That has certainly been the prevailing view in Georgia, where even leading Democrats - their prestige on the line for introducing touchscreen voting in the first place - have fought tooth-and-nail to defend the integrity of the system. In a phone interview, the head of the Georgia Technology Authority who brought Diebold machines to the state, Larry Singer, blamed the growing chorus of criticism on "fear of technology", despite the fact that many prominent critics are themselves computer scientists. He says: "Are these machines flawless? No. Would you have more confidence if they were completely flawless? Yes. Is there such a thing as a flawless system? No." Mr Singer, who left the GTA straight after the election and took a 50 per cent pay cut to work for Sun Microsystems, insists that voters are more likely to have their credit card information stolen by a busboy in a restaurant than to have their vote compromised by touchscreen technology.  Voting machines are sold in the United States in much the same way as other government contracts: through intensive lobbying, wining and dining. At a recent national conference of clerks, election officials and treasurers in Denver, attendees were treated to black-tie dinners and other perks, including free expensive briefcases stamped with Sequoia's company logo alongside the association's own symbol. Nobody in power seems to find this worrying, any more than they worried when Sequoia's southern regional sales manager, Phil Foster, was indicted in Louisiana a couple of years ago for "conspiracy to commit money laundering and malfeasance". The charges were dropped in exchange for his testimony against Louisiana's state commissioner of elections. Similarly, last year, the Arkansas secretary of state, Bill McCuen, pleaded guilty to taking bribes and kickbacks involving a precursor company to ES&amp;S; the voting machine company executive who testified against him in exchange for immunity is now an ES&amp;S vice-president.  If much of the worry about vote-tampering is directed at the Republicans, it is largely because the big three touchscreen companies are all big Republican donors, pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into party coffers in the past few years. The ownership issue is, of course, compounded by the lack of transparency. Or, as Dr Mercuri puts it: "If the machines were independently verifiable, who would give a crap who owns them?" As it is, fears that US democracy is being hijacked by corporate interests are being fueled by links between the big three and broader business interests, as well as extremist organizations. Two of the early backers of American Information Systems, a company later merged into ES&amp;S, are also prominent supporters of the Chalcedon Foundation, an organization that espouses theocratic governance according to a literal reading of the Bible and advocates capital punishment for blasphemy and homosexuality.  The chief executive of American Information Systems in the early Nineties was Chuck Hagel, who went on to run for elective office and became the first Republican in 24 years to be elected to the Senate from Nebraska, cheered on by the Omaha World-Herald newspaper which also happens to be a big investor in ES&amp;S. In yet another clamorous conflict of interest, 80 per cent of Mr Hagel's winning votes - both in 1996 and again in 2002 - were counted, under the usual terms of confidentiality, by his own company.  In theory, the federal government should be monitoring the transition to computer technology and rooting out abuses. Under the Help America Vote Act, the Bush administration is supposed to establish a sizeable oversight committee, headed by two Democrats and two Republicans, as well as a technical panel to determine standards for new voting machinery. The four commission heads were supposed to have been in place by last February, but so far just one has been appointed. The technical panel also remains unconstituted, even though the new machines it is supposed to vet are already being sold in large quantities - a state of affairs Dr Mercuri denounces as "an abomination".  One of the conditions states have to fulfil to receive federal funding for the new voting machines, meanwhile, is a consolidation of voter rolls at state rather than county level. This provision sends a chill down the spine of anyone who has studied how Florida consolidated its own voter rolls just before the 2000 election, purging the names of tens of thousands of eligible voters, most of them African Americans and most of them Democrats, through misuse of an erroneous list of convicted felons commissioned by Katherine Harris, the secretary of state doubling as George Bush's Florida campaign manager. Despite a volley of lawsuits, the incorrect list was still in operation in last November's mid-terms, raising all sorts of questions about what other states might now do with their own voter rolls. It is not that the Act's consolidation provision is in itself evidence of a conspiracy to throw elections, but it does leave open that possibility.  Meanwhile, the administration has been pushing new voting technology of its own to help overseas citizens and military personnel, both natural Republican Party constituencies, to vote more easily over the internet. Internet voting is notoriously insecure and open to abuse by just about anyone with rudimentary hacking skills; just last January, an experiment in internet voting in Toronto was scuppered by a Slammer worm attack. Undeterred, the administration has gone ahead with its so-called SERVE project for overseas voting, via a private consortium made up of major defense contractors and a Saudi investment group. The contract for overseeing internet voting in the 2004 presidential election was recently awarded to Accenture, formerly part of the Arthur Andersen group (whose accountancy branch, a major campaign contributor to President Bush, imploded as a result of the Enron bankruptcy scandal).  Not everyone in the United States has fallen under the spell of the big computer voting companies, and there are signs of growing wariness. Oregon decided even before HAVA to conduct all its voting by mail. Wisconsin has decided it wants nothing to do with touchscreen machines without a verifiable paper trail, and New York is considering a similar injunction, at least for its state assembly races. In California, a Stanford computer science professor called David Dill is screaming from the rooftops on the need for a paper trail in his state, so far without result. And a New Jersey Congressman called Rush Holt has introduced a bill in the House of Representatives, the Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act, asking for much the same thing. Not everyone is heeding the warnings, though. In Ohio, publication of the letter from Diebold's chief executive promising to deliver the state to President Bush in 2004 has not deterred the secretary of state - a Republican - from putting Diebold on a list of preferred voting-machine vendors. Similarly, in Maryland, officials have not taken the recent state-sponsored study identifying hundreds of flaws in the Diebold software as any reason to change their plans to use Diebold machines in March's presidential primary.  The question is whether the country will come to its senses before elections start getting distorted or tampered with on such a scale that the system becomes unmanageable. The sheer volume of money offered under HAVA is unlikely to be forthcoming again in a hurry, so if things aren't done right now it is doubtful the system can be fixed again for a long time. "This is frightening, really frightening," says Dr Mercuri, and a growing number of reasonable people are starting to agree with her. One such is John Zogby, arguably the most reliable pollster in the United States, who has freely admitted he "blew" last November's elections and does not exclude the possibility that foul play was one of the factors knocking his calculations off course. "We're plowing into a brave new world here," he says, "where there are so many variables aside from out-and-out corruption that can change elections, especially in situations where the races are close. We have machines that break down, or are tampered with, or are simply misunderstood. It's a cause for great concern."  Roxanne Jekot, who has put much of her professional and personal life on hold to work on the issue full time, puts it even more strongly. "Corporate America is very close to running this country. The only thing that is stopping them from taking total control are the pesky voters. That's why there's such a drive to control the vote. What we're seeing is the corporatization of the last shred of democracy.  "I feel that unless we stop it here and stop it now," she says, "my kids won't grow up to have a right to vote at all."  © 2003 Independent Digital (UK) Ltd  Also See: Diebold Voting Machine Owner Committed To Give Votes To Bush in 2004 Cleveland Plain Dealer 8/28/2003  Will Bush Backers Manipulate Votes to Deliver GW Another Election?

The pols might drop these corporations a bone every once in a while, but what they are giving them is money or tax breaks. They are not changing their core policies because of the lobbyists.

Michael Moore	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-212-191665-3142027	It is mentioned a few times in "Bowling For Columbine", along with photos of him winning some shooting awards or something, it is part of his "these are my people" bit in Michigan.  Here is MM's explanation :-  MM: "I was a junior member when I was in the boy scouts when I was a kid, but I became a lifetime member after the Columbine massacre because my first thought after Columbine was to run against Charlton Heston for the presidency of the NRA. You have to be a lifetime member to be able to do that, so I had to pay $750 (about £450) to join. My plan was to get 5m Americans to join for the lowest basic membership and vote for me so that I'd win and dismantle the organisation. Unfortunately, I figured that's just too much work for me so instead I made this movie. But I'm still a lifetime member, until they excommunicate me... which is not far off, from what I hear."

But they haven't since Russia collapsed. the real reason is that the Chinese Dragon wont allow them to fall. China is a gaurantor of that regime, and both Nortn Korea and Pakistan are its proxies."  The real reason is because the Chinese would like the North Koreans to remain peacefull, their just as concerned about nukes in thir backyard as the U.S. is.  "Confed buddy the bottom line is the same for everyone, just as it is for this 2 cent lackey ass musharraf, that either fall in line or get it in the booty!.....or better as yet, no mater which way you turn, you are gonna get it in dee ass!"  Wisely Musharraf is following the U.S. and not your lackys Lull, your right he is towing the line, the U.S. line...  "So when the U.S. itself sits on 5000 nuclear warheads and supprts an illegal entity like israel, but strongly opposes another illegal entity like North Korea then no one can trust them!"  You seem to leave quite a few point's out there Lull, Israel is not an elligal entity, its recognized as a nation by the U.N., yes your beloved U.N. Ifthe U.S. is so uncaring about the people in the korean penninsula why don't they just nuke Korea? They don't have missles that can reach the U.S., so with your logic theres nothing to lose right?  "Kinda like a smoking father tellin his retarded son to quit smokin.... First the U.S. and Russia should stand on a neutral/ moral or better yet a non hypocritical platform before preachin bullshit about WMD's."  Father knows best, he knows just what kind of hell smoking has put him through, fighting lung cancer so its a good thing that he tells his kid to quit now and save himself.  "In all honesty I don't think North Korea threatens anyone, as long as they are left alone to do their thing."  You definately don't have a clue do you Lull, ever listen to ol Kim?  "They wont invade the South unless provoked."  They don't invade because they know they will be wiped off the face of the earth.  "Like wise Pakistan, india, israel or Iran don't threaten anyone either. It is ludicrous for the successive Administrations to assume that everyone else is a neanderthal!"  The left seem to think its not ludacrous to call Bush a neanderthal, my how hypocritical!  Pakistan dosn't invade because they have India to deal with, if they play their cards wrong the U.S. supports India and its game over....  India dosn't attack for the same reason as Pakistan, China might join Pakistan.  Israel doesn't invade because they are a civilized nation  Iran dosn't invade because they know they would give us the excuse we need to remove the mulahs from power and establish a free society in Iran, by not attacking they bide time to fight their little poxy wars in Iraq and Afganistan.	smilingassassin	like	 false

Tim Tebow	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181137-9028752	I have nothing against Tebow, I'm a huge Gators fan-and he was great for them. For me the thing is that he's getting shoved down your throats everywhere now-not just the sports channels either, it's all over the place. Enough is enough.  I was randomly scanning on my radio the other day (I was bored) and I actually heard a preacher talking about how great Tebow was-and that true christians should get behind him-and route for the Broncos because they're a christian team compared tot he others. I decided to hear it out, out of curiosity. And the preacher went on for a good 10-15 mins on Tebow. Now being a Catholic I believe in Jesus, and I'm a very religious person, so I'm not anti-christian by any means-but this guy isn't Jesus, it's annoying that so many talk about him like he's some sort of profit or something.

There are some bad eggs. But the networks in general treated her as a serious candidate when she looked like one, and laughed her off when she'd earned the laughing off.  Of course, Palin didn't help herself either. She was pretty provocative with her "Real Americans" dialogue. In the same way every time Obama mentions Fox news, he just shoots himself in the foot.

To then turn around and feign outrage over sarah being treated the same way is just disingenuous... which is kind of what my point was in the first place...  and for that, i got called names by someone who couldn't even respond appropriately as to why sarah should be treated any better than hillary was.  I don't think that was an unreasonble question.	jillian	satirized	 false

It can't be her statesmanship because she has expressed the idea that there are parts of America more "American" than others.

Rape is all about power and control and has very little to do with sexual desire. The rapist rapes when opportunity knocks, not when he is aroused by attire or attitude.  Never did I say the things said about her were fair or civil. However, what she has said about Democrats, liberals and President Obama is bound to elicit a response - some civil, some profane and even vulgar. That is what I meant by "she brought it on herself".  Now, I suppose your thinking (if in fact you do) that Sandra Fluke is responsible and deserved the vile and hateful comments broadcast about her to the nation by Mr. Limbaugh was deserved. That you may not know the difference between a public figure and a private citizen is understandable - partisanship gets in the way of rational thought.

Dottie Sandusky	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-203-185943-18624858	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. - December 8, 2011 (WPVI) -- About one month after her husband was charged with child sex crimes, and a day after he was arrested on additional charges, the wife of former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky broke her silence.  In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, Dottie Sandusky said:. I want to thank our children, our family, our extended family of former Second Mile participants, and all our friends for standing by us through these difficult times. Jerry and I want to express our sorrow for all the hurt that has come to those who have supported us and our beloved Penn State and State College Communities. I have been shocked and dismayed by the allegations made against Jerry, particularly the most recent one that a now young man has said he was kept in our basement during visits and screamed for help as Jerry assaulted him while I was in our home and didn't respond to his cries for help. As the mother of six children, I have been devastated by these accusations. I am also angry about these false accusations that such a terrible incident ever occurred in my home. No child who ever visited our home was ever forced to stay in our basement and fed there. All the kids who visited us ate with us and our kids and other guests when they were at our home. Our children, our extended family and friends know how much Jerry and I love kids and have always tried to help and care for them. We would never do anything to hurt them. I am so sad anyone would make such a terrible accusation which is absolutely untrue. We don't know why these young men have made these false accusations, but we want everyone to know they are untrue. I continue to believe in Jerry's innocence and all the good things he has done. Jerry's many success stories with his Second Mile kids and positive memories of those kids keep me going. I am asking everyone to please be reasonable and open-minded until both sides of this case are heard, and Jerry has the opportunity to prove his innocence. I would like to thank all those individuals who continue to support Jerry and hope they will continue to support us through the conclusion of this very sad time in our lives. Earlier Thursday, Jerry Sandusky left jail after posting $250,000 bail. Sandusky secured his release using $200,000 in real estate holdings and a $50,000 certified check provided by Dorothy Sandusky, according to online court records. The jail's warden said he was quiet and cooperative during his overnight stay. A judge ordered the accused child sex abuser and former Penn State assistant football coach to be electronically monitored after he posts bail. Sandusky's attorney says he will need to be out of jail to continue working on an aggressive defense against the allegations that he molested and sexually assaulted 10 young boys who were part of his Second Mile program. RELATED: <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/feature?section=news&amp;id=8458482">WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT - Read the latest Grand Jury Report on Victims 9 and 10</a> (Mobile users: <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/uploadedFiles/Press/Sandusky-Presentment2-12-7-2011.pdf">CLICK HERE</a> ) At Sandusky's home Thursday morning the only activity was his wife, and a man who appeared to be his son, leaving. There will be conditions to Sandusky's electronic monitoring. We don't know if he will be allowed to leave his home at certain times or to meet with his attorney. "It will be the equivalent to house arrest," said Sandusky's attorney Joe Amandola. "Of course with the media people staked outside his house for the last 4 weeks, 5 weeks, he's basically been confined to his house except when he's come to see me." We do know the judge ordered Sandusky to stay away from Penn State's campus and he can have no contact with minors or his alleged victims who are expected to testify in a preliminary hearing next week. "My biggest immediate concern is for the protection of not only the victim who I represent but for the other victims who need to testify next week and preserving not only their identities but preserving their ability to lead normal and active full lives," attorney Tom Kline told Action News. Sandusky was arrested Wednesday and charged with 12 new sex abuse counts involving two new alleged victims. He has maintained his innocence. The latest accusers are the ninth and 10th alleged victims described in grand jury reports that claim Sandusky befriended and then molested boys he met through his Second Mile charity for troubled youth. A grand jury document released Wednesday echoed an earlier report, saying Sandusky gave the boys gifts while also making sexual advances toward them. One of the new accusers said Sandusky kept him in a basement bedroom during overnight visits to Sandusky's home, forced him to perform sex acts and assaulted him. "The victim testified that on at least one occasion he screamed for help, knowing that Sandusky's wife was upstairs, but no one ever came to help him," the grand jury report said. Sandusky was charged last month with abusing eight boys, some on campus, over 15 years, allegations that were not immediately brought to the attention of authorities even though high-level people at Penn State apparently knew about them. In all, he faces more than 50 charges. The scandal has resulted in the ousting of school President Graham Spanier and longtime coach Joe Paterno.	RedheadBak...	COLLEGE	 false

Dottie Sandusky	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-203-185943-18624858	Well, add her to a long list of political/spotlight wives who have decided to act like doormats.

It's one thing to humiliate you in that way as a private citizen, it's another to do it in such a spectacularly public way. Also, it's one thing to have an affair, it's another to rape little boys.

I would have loathed open showering, and TTT, we rarely if ever showered after PE in either middle school or high school.

The use of these herbicides has consistently produced health complaints from people in the Colombian countryside. Those complaints have gone largely ignored by Washington and Monsanto. A month before Wellstone was doused, Colombian indigenous leaders visited Congress to speak out against the fumigation. "The 12 indigenous peoples have been suffering under this plague as if it were a government decree to exterminate our culture and our very survival," said Jose Francisco Tenono, the only leader who was not afraid to use his real name. "Our only sustenance - manioc, banana, palms, sugar cane and corn - have been fumigated. Our sources of water, creeks, rivers, lakes, have been poisoned, killing our fish... Today, hunger is our daily bread. In the name of the Amazonian Indigenous people I ask that the fumigations be immediately suspended." So far, Tenorio's pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Last summer, Congress approved $1.3 billion for "Plan Colombia" to carry out the drug war and more funds are forthcoming.  </quote>  <a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Drug_War/Monsanto_DrugWar.html">Monsanto and the 'Drug War'</a>  Agent Orange anyone?

Monsanto	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8790264	In reality, Monsanto is a perfectly upstanding organization who has no intent to take advantage of any of the folks who use their products. They deserve an international "do-gooder" award.  The fact that farmers can no longer generate germinating seeds of their own once they switch to a Monsanto product is inconsequential and is over-ruled by the fact that Monsanto gave these seeds free of charge, and by the fact that they have built-in pesticides.  If you have negative opinions of these activities it's obvious that you have forgotten your meds, or you have yet to be diagnosed. But don't worry.

It took two years for the pre-trail motions and paper-work to be completed. During this time, Monsanto dropped their charge that Percy had illegally obtained the GMO seed. Because this was a patent case, the case would not be heard by a jury but by one federal judge. The trial took two and one-half weeks.  The federal judge decided that it did not matter how the GMO crops got into his field, he must pay Monsanto their fee of $15/acre. In addition, the judge ordered that Percy pay Monsanto all of the profits from his 1998 crop, and that he must turn over all of the plants and seeds to Monsanto. Two of Percys fields were not contaminated with Monsanto GMOs and 60% of the GMOs Monsanto found were in the ditch by the road.  </quote>  <a href="http://www.savethepinebush.org/News/04FebMar/PercySchmeiser.html">Who Owns Life?

That said I still see Monsanto as an unethical corporation, I still can't get pass this;  <quote> In December 2000, Dutch journalist Marjon Van Royen investigated local health reports in Colombia and found that there had been "consistent health complaints," including "burning eyes, dizziness and respiratory problems." According to Elsa Nivia, a Colombian agronomist who works with the Pesticide Action Network, local authorities reported 4,289 humans suffering skin or gastric disorders in the first two months of 2001. Some 178,377 animals (cattle, horses, pigs, dogs, ducks, hens and fish) were reported killed by the spraying. Digging further, Van Royen found something alarming: another additive called Cosmo-Flux 411 F was being added to increase the toxicity of Roundup Ultra The Roundup/Cosmo-Flux mixture has never been scientifically evaluated nor has the public - either in the US or in Colombia - been informed of this practice. In a talk at the University of California at Davis in May 2001, Nivia said: "The mixture with the Cosmo Flux 411 F surfactant can increase the herbicide's biological action four-fold, producing relative exposure levels which are 104 times higher than the recommended doses for normal agricultural applications in the United States; doses which, according to the study mentioned, can intoxicate and even kill ruminants." The use of this enhanced Roundup would not be acceptable in the US without prior testing and scientific evaluation. The Roundup label warns: "Do not apply this product in a way that will contact workers or other persons, either directly or through drift. Only protected handlers may be in the area during application." "Drift" is a major issue, as Senator Wellstone discovered first hand. The small crop duster airplanes and helicopters that spray chemical herbicides in Colombia often fly too high to accurately target the drug crops. Labels warn that spraying must be done on windless days. But nature does not often provide windless days in the tropical Andean valleys. A small plane flying as low as 65 feet is subject to high crosswinds that characterize rainforest ecology. These winds easily blow the herbicide toward non-target areas, contaminating crops, rainforests or bodies of water. Last spring, the German government lodged complaints against the fumigation program when chemical "drift" destroyed Colombian aquaculture projects they had underwritten- fishponds meant to provide protein for campesino subsistence.  </quote>  <a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Drug_War/Monsanto_DrugWar.html">Monsanto and the 'Drug War'</a>  </quote>  Covering their asses says it all. They get to unenlightened farmers by sharp sales practices, sell them a "license agreement" written, of course, by a team of lawyers, and therein it states in a long paragraph of fine print that said farmer must buy from Monsanto every succeeding year.

I'd rather voluntarily pay a little more for a product made in our nation, which has strong labor and environmental laws, than be taxed involuntarily to pay welfare and unemployment for unemployed Americans.  I also prefer to buy products made as close to home as possible because shipping things a long ways is wasteful of fossil fuels and harder on the environment.  I'm not a pro-union person, but Walmart has employed what I view as unethical union-busting tactics. They also play a lot of games with schedules in order to keep their employees under the amount of hours needed for benefits. And, they have crabby employees, generally. I also dislike being greeted at the door, I find it incredibly phony and intrusive.	Middleman	shop	 true

Wal-Mart Stores Inc	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-68495	Buy American... Good idea, "if"... American made stuff wasn't so high priced due to the inflated salaries that union members demand. There are pros and cons associated with shopping at Wal-mart. It's true that the majority of their stuff is made outside of America but America produces so little things "made in America" because of the cost of union labor. Wal-mart employs a lot of people in my area that would not have a job if it wasn't for them. There is a Wal-mart distribution warehouse not so far away from where I live. I know many people who work there. The pay there isn't great but if you don't farm, in my part of the world the jobs are few and far between. Everybody bitches and moans about Wal-mart but if they closed up shop today, there would be a large amount of people out of a job across America. So, whine about that. You can't have your cake and eat it too. It's a very noble thing to "Buy American" and I wish we lived in the time again when just about everything we purchased was made in America but these days very little is produced here and it gets worse every day. Quit whining.	Big Black Dog	associated	 false

Wal-Mart Stores Inc	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-68495	Walmart's prices are lower because they are masters at capturing efficiencies of scale at every juncture, from manufacturing to transport to retail pricing.....things that a small, local business cannot do. Let's say you needed a case of paper, Dis. Your local stationer's will sell you American made paper for $15, and Walmarts will sell you Chinese made paper for $12.  Save $3 at Walmarts?  Not when you factor in the unemployment a Walmarts caused when it forced many local small businesses to close (your local stationers' will likely be next), the environmental impact these stores have, the loss of local culture as everything we buy becomes homogenized, etc.  Chances are, your local stationer's is also helping keep that American paper company in business. Once it closes, that plant is in greater jeoprady.  I'm not saying you can always choose to pay more for American....I'm saying there's a terrible, hidden cost to buying foreign-made goods at Walmarts. Mayhaps you can sometimes choose to Buy American?

Somebody at Wal-Mart must have pissed you off. The point I am trying to make is that Wal-Mart doesn't have a monopoly on bad employees. All companies have both good and bad employees. 95% of the time I get great service at Wal-Mart and that seems to be about on par with everywhere else I shop. Chill out.

I found out *later* that it has no harsh chemicals, leaves no residue, and is made from only plant extracts. Aded bonus? Sure - but not one I was considering at the time.  Quality wins out. I've stopped even *trying* other brands - I have to go out of my way to get it from an Aveda salon, but it's a small price to pay for not having to look around anymore, and play the guessing game.  I'll tell you this, tho..

The people they replace in your community bought cars and homes and including themselves hired 3-4 times as many of your local neighbors. The business destroyed supported local sports programs like little league. The pissant jobs they offer are not living wage jobs. The profits go out of your community and the bulk of what is spent goes to China. All so cheapskates like you can get a slightly better deal. You are selfish and short sighted. The benefits to a community before a Walmart shows up include people sending their kids to college among many others.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181113-68495	Her is a short list of companies/items to boycott:  Here are 18 Iconic Products That America Doesn't Make Anymore:  Rawlings baseballs  Last production date: 1969  Rawlings is the official supplier of baseballs to Major League Baseball. The St. Louis shop was founded in 1887 by George and Alfred Rawlings. In 1969 the brothers moved the baseball-manufacturing plant from Puerto Rico to Haiti and then later to Costa Rica.  Etch a Sketch  Last production date: 2000  Etch A Sketch, an iconic American toy since the 1960s, used to be produced in Bryan, Ohio, a small town of 8,000. Then in Dec. 2000, toymaker Ohio Art decided to move production to Shenzhen, China.  Converse shoes  Last production date: 2001  Marquis M. Converse opened Converse Rubber Show Company in Massachusetts in 1908. Chuck Taylors– named after All American high school basketball player Chuck Taylor– began selling in 1918 as the show eventually produced an industry record of over 550 million pairs by 1997. But in 2001 sales were on the decline and the U.S. factory closed. Now Chuck Taylors are made in Indonesia.  Stainless steel rebar  Last production date: circa 2001  Many forms of this basic steel product are not available domestically. Multiple waivers to the Buy America Act have allowed purchase of rebar internationally.  Note: The Buy America Act requires government mass transportation spending to use American products.  Dress shirts*  Last production date: Oct. 2002  The last major shirt factory in America closed in October 2002, according to NYT. C.F. Hathaway's Maine factory had been producing shirts since 1837.  *We know there are other shirt manufacturers in America. They do not produce in large quantities or supply major brands.  Mattel toys  Last production date: 2002  The largest toy company in the world closed their last American factory in 2002. Mattel, headquartered in California, produces 65 percent of their products in China as of August 2007.  Minivans  Last production date: circa 2003  A waiver to the Buy America Act permitted an American producer of wheel-chair accessible minivans to purchase Canadian chassis for use in government contracts, because no chassis were available from the United States. The waiver specified: "General Motors and Chrysler minivan chassis, including those used on the Chevrolet Uplander, Pontiac Montana, Buick Terraza, Saturn Relay, Chrysler Town &amp; Country, and Dodge Grand Caravan, are no longer manufactured in the United States."  Note: The Buy America Act requires government mass transportation spending to use American products.  Vending machines  Last production date: circa 2003  You know that thing you put bills into on a vending machine? It isn't made in America, according to a waiver to the Buy America Act.  Neither is the coin dispenser, according to this federal waiver.  Note: The Buy America Act requires government mass transportation spending to use American products.  Levi jeans  Last production date: Dec. 2003  Levi Strauss &amp; Co. shut down all its American operations and outsourced production to Latin America and Asia in Dec. 2003. The company's denim products have been an iconic American product for 150 years.  Radio Flyer's Red Wagon  Last production date: March 2004  The little red wagon has been an iconic image of America for years. But once Radio Flyer decided its Chicago plant was too expensive, it began producing most products, including the red wagon, in China.  Televisions  Last production date: Oct. 2004  Five Rivers Electronic Innovations was the last American owned TV color maker in the US. The Tennessee company used LCoS (liquid crystal on silicon) technology to produce televisions for Philips Electronics. But after Philips decided to stop selling TVs with LCoS, Five Rivers eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Oct. 2004. As part of its reorganization plan, the company stopped manufacturing TVs.  Now there are ZERO televisions made in America, according to Business Week.  Cell phones  Last production date: circa 2007  Of the 1.2 billion cell phones sold worldwide in 2008, NOT ONE was made in America, according to Manufacturing &amp; Technology publisher Richard McCormick.  After studying the websites of cell phone companies, we could not identify a single phone that was not manufactured primarily overseas.  Railroads (parts including manganese turnout castings, U69 guard bars, LV braces and weld kits)  Last production date: circa 2008  Here's another standout from dozens of waivers to the Buy America Act: railroad turnouts and weld kits.  Manganese turnout castings are used to widen railroad tracks, and they were used to build our once-great railroad system. U69 guard bars, LV braces and Weld Kits, along with 22 mm Industrial steel chain are basic items that were certifiably not available in the US.  Note: The Buy America Act requires government mass transportation spending to use American products.  Dell computers  Last production date: Jan. 2010  In January 2010, Dell closed its North Carolina PC factory, its last large U.S. plant. Analysts said Dell would be outsourcing work to Asian manufacturers in an attempt to catch up with the rest of the industry, said analyst Ashok Kumar.  Canned sardines  Last production date: April 2010  Stinson Seafood plant, the last sardine cannery in Maine and the U.S., shut down in April. The first U.S. sardine cannery opened in Maine in 1875, but since the demand for the small, oily fish declined, more canneries closed shop.  Pontiac cars  Last production date: May 2010  The last Pontiac was produced last May. The brand was formally killed on Halloween, as GM contracts Pontiac dealerships expired.  The 84-year-old GM brand was famous for muscle cars.  Forks, spoons, and knives  Last production date: June 2010  The last flatware factory in the US closed last summer. Sherrill Manufacturing bought Oneida Ltd. in 2005, but shut down its fork &amp; knife operations due to the tough economy. CEO Greg Owens says his company may resume production "when the general economic climate improves and as Sherrill Manufacturing is able to put itself back on its feet and recapitalize and regroup."  Incandescent light bulb  Last production date: Sept. 2010  The incandescent light bulb (invented by Thomas Edison) has been phased out.  Our last major factory that made incandescent light bulbs closed in September 2010. In 2007, Congress passed a measure that will ban incandescents by 2014, prompting GE to close its domestic factory.	uscitizen	percent	 false

Perhaps we just have a really sucky Wal Mart, but I've been to several throughout the country in different places I've lived and roamed.

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	Kevin Martin, chair of the FCC, is now moving to implement a plan for weakening media ownership rules which, when Powell attempted it two or three years ago, created enough of a loud and bipartisan public outcry such that the plan was dropped, or more correctly, pushed out of sight for a while. He has now said he wants to get this done by this December.  This is a very important issue and I encourage everyone to make a lot of noise about it.  Who is Kevin Martin?  <quote> Controversy In October 2007, Chairman Martin proposed an advanced timetable for amending FCC regulations on media consolidation. Like his predecessor, Micheal Powell, Martin's plan is controversial because it "relaxes the decades-old media ownership rules, including repealing a rule that forbids a company to own both a newspaper and a television or radio station in the same city."[5] The plan has also raised eyebrows because of the speed with which Martin wants to enact his proposals and the lack of opportunities for accepting public and Congressional input on the matter.  [edit]Background Martin, a Republican born in Charlotte, N.C., was selected March 16, 2005, by President Bush as FCC Chairman to replace Michael Powell, who announced in January 2005 that he was leaving the top post. "Because he already is a member of the FCC, Martin's promotion, which had been widely expected, does not need to be confirmed by the Senate." [6]  "Kevin Martin, was one of the first national Bush-Cheney people to arrive in Miami from Washington, on Nov. 8, 2000. He had been a deputy general counsel for the Bush campaign and before that worked for Ken Starr, the independent counsel in the Monica Lewinsky affair." [7] [8]  Martin previously worked in the Office of the Independent Counsel, at the law and lobby firm Wiley, Rein, &amp; Fielding, and advised former FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth. [9]  Martin is married to Cathie Martin, former communications director for Vice President Dick Cheney and currently a member of President George W. Bush's communications staff.

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	Bernie, the following is all i could find pertaining to the FCC - and the Washington affiliation. Senator Boxer will undoubtably be vocal if and when new FCC regulations are presented.  FCC to Review Media Study Ron Orol The Deal September 18, 2006  Provided by The Deal Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin will review a contentious media ownership study that a former agency lawyer had said was destroyed.  Martin said he and his staff were unaware of the study, which suggested that looser limits on media mergers would hurt local television news coverage, according to a letter he sent late Thursday to Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.  But he added that it brought up matters relevant to the commission's media ownership proceeding, which began in July, and he planned to include the study in the agency's body of data that will be reviewed.  "I was not chairman at the time that this report was drafted," Martin wrote in a letter to Boxer released late Thursday. "I had not seen, nor was I aware of this draft report before you brought it to my attention. No one on my staff had seen this report nor were they aware of it."  A former lawyer from the FCC's media bureau, Adam Candeub, said the agency ordered its staff to destroy all copies of the draft study written in 2004. Boxer released the study during Martin's Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.  Candeub, now a law professor at Michigan State University, said senior management at the agency ordered the report destroyed.  In July, Martin launched the agency's third attempt to craft media merger regulations. The new round of regulatory initiatives followed a 2003 effort completed by Martin's predecessor, Michael Powell, permitting more media consolidation.  Harold Feld, director of Washington-based public interest law firm Media Access Project, said Powell apparently sought only to produce studies that complemented his plan for media ownership rules.  "It appears that it was Michael Powell, not the public, who preferred to make decisions based on 'personal ideology,'" Feld said in a statement.  In 2004, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia rejected the agency's new criteria and ordered the commission to produce new media rules.  Martin is expected to try to eliminate the prohibition on one company owning a television station and the major newspaper in a particular market.  His letter responds to one Boxer sent him on Wednesday expressing dismay "that this report, which was done at taxpayer expense more than two years ago, and which concluded that localism is beneficial to the public, was shoved in a drawer."  Two economists in the FCC's media bureau conducted the study, "Do local owners deliver more localism?"  It analyzed a database of news stories broadcast in 1998. It showed that local ownership of television stations added almost 5-1/2 minutes of total news to broadcasts and more than three minutes of "on-location" news.  The FCC's media ownership rules are intended to protect diversity of local opinions available to consumers.  A study demonstrating that consolidation reduces the amount of local news available to consumers would make it difficult for Martin to proceed with plans to ease restrictions on media mergers.  Martin is expected to argue that consumers have access to more local news and information through the Internet and new community newspapers than they did even in 2003, the last time the agency considered changes to the media rules.

And last week, he easily won re-election for a second term and is now being talked up as the Republicans' vice presidential nominee next year.  <quote> WASHINGTON -- The last time federal regulators tried to change the rules on how many media outlets companies could own, the effort bombed like a bad movie. The sequel appears to be headed for the same fate. </quote>  Monday, September 18, 2006  Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) wrote to FCC Chairman Kevin Martin bringing to light a second report on media ownership that seems to have been suppressed by the FCC. Following is Senator Boxer's letter to Chairman Martin:  September 18, 2006  Chairman Kevin J. Martin Federal Communications Commission 445 12th Street SW Washington, DC 20554  Dear Chairman Martin, Since I last wrote to you, another draft FCC report that was never made public has come to my attention.  I have now received a copy of the Commission's draft 2003 "Review of the Radio Industry." The report found, among other things, that while there was a 5.9 percent increase in the number of radio stations in the country between March 1996 and March 2003, there was a 35 percent decrease in the number of radio owners. The report also found that Clear Channel Communications, the largest radio group owner, went from owning 62 stations in 1996, to 1,233 in 2003.  For reasons I do not understand, this report was never finalized even though the FCC had released similar reports in 2002, September 2001, January 2001, and 1998. Moreover, the Commission has not released a "Review of the Radio Industry" report since 2002. This is in spite of the fact that this information would be highly relevant to the Commission's ongoing proceedings on localism and media ownership.  Recently, it was reported in Radio and Records that Clear Channel had visited two Commissioners' offices on August 31, 2006 "to influence their positions on expanding ownership cap limits in the largest radio markets."  I trust that you will update and release this report prior to the conclusion of the media ownership proceeding so that the Commission will be able to make its decision based on the most current industry data.  Chairman Martin, this is the second report in a week that I have received that appears to have been shelved by officials within the FCC and I am growing more and more concerned at these developments.  In light of this new discovery, I will ask the Inspector General of the FCC to thoroughly investigate not only the draft 2003 "Review of the Radio Industry" and the 2004 localism study, but also to examine whether it was then or is now the practice of the FCC to suppress facts that are contrary to a desired outcome. Although I understand that you were not Chairman at the time these documents were produced, I wanted to bring this new incident to your attention and urge your office's full cooperation with the Inspector General.  Sincerely,  Barbara Boxer United States Senator	Stradee	Boxer	 false

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	I have no opinion concerning the veracity of the quote. However I do know that Ted Turner himself has invested heavily in and created media enterprises and used them to advance his own political views. I found it rather odd that anyone would use him to vocalize the same accusation against Murdoch. More than a hint of blatant hypocrisy there - a laughable case of the liberal pot calling the conservative kettle black.  Second, there were many reasons for Blair's ascent to power. I believe his actions in inducing the British Labor Party to abandon its utterly discredited Trades union identity was the chief reason for his victory, and not the machinations of Rupert Murdoch. They may well have helped, but to ignore the other factors is simply to ignore history.  <quote orig_author="blatham"> Second, I've noted the clearly partisan nature of the FCC chair's prior positions and activities. </quote>  The current dispite within the FCC is quite partison on both sides. No one argues that the current rules aren't anachronistic - they harken back to an era in which there was intense competition in most U.S. cities between multiple newspapers and a wide open field for investment in the then new TV industry. Both sides of this question have changed in profound ways, and the need for reform is now clear.

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	FCC To Vote On Ownership Rules Review FCC To Vote On Ownership Rules Review  WASHINGTON -- November 20, 2007: The FCC is set to vote on at least part of its media-ownership rules at its next open meeting, set for Tuesday, November 27.  The just-released agenda for the meeting says the FCC will vote on a Report and Order in the 2006 quadrennial rules review and consider a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking "concerning initiatives designed to increase participation in the broadcasting industry by new entrants and small businesses, including minority- and women-owned businesses."  It's unclear what actions, if any, the agecny may take in the R&amp;O, and which rules will be subject to further consideration under the FNPRM.  Among the rules under review are the local radio ownership rules, which regulate how many stations one company can own in a market. Also on the table are the agency's radio-TV cross ownership and cross-media ownership rules.  FCC Chairman Kevin Martin last week released a proposal to eliminate the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership ban in the top 20 markets if certain conditions are met, with no changes to the radio ownership limit, the radio-TV cross-ownership rules, or the TV-duopoly rule, which are also under review.  That proposal was greeted with protests from Capitol Hill and FCC Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein, and the vote has been scheduled despite pleas from lawmakers to delay any rules changes until a separate localism proceeding has been completed -- and despite the introduction by Sen. Byron Dorgan of the Media Ownership Act of 2007, which would delay an FCC vote on new ownership rules until after it has held a new localism proceeding and considered the recommendations of a diversity task force.

From Reuters November 21, 2007  WASHINGTON -- A group of Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives raised objections Tuesday to a Federal Communications Commission proposal that could lead to tougher regulation of cable television operators.  A letter signed by 23 House Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee expressed serious doubts about the prospect of a regulatory crackdown on the cable industry, raised in a report that FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin has circulated among the agency's other commissioners.  "Such actions are unsupported by the record of significant competition in the video programming marketplace, and would be harmful to innovation and consumers," the lawmakers wrote.  The prospect of further cable regulation is contained in the latest annual report on video competition.  The report finds U.S. cable subscription levels have exceeded 70% where service is available, passing a threshold that would give the agency more authority over companies such as Comcast Corp. and Time Warner Cable Inc.  The study has met with resistance from Martin's fellow Republican FCC commissioners, Robert M. McDowell and Deborah Taylor Tate.  McDowell and Tate have raised doubts about how Martin arrived at the figure because it conflicts with findings in the same report in previous years.  McDowell said Monday that without further substantiation, he would not support the 70% finding in the video competition report.  The letter from House Republicans could make it more difficult for Martin to get the three votes that he needs to accept the report, one Capitol Hill source said.  The lawmakers' letter said Martin's proposed 70% finding was "suspect not only on legal grounds, but also on factual ones."  The Republican lawmakers also expressed opposition to any requirement that the industry adopt a system, supported by Martin, that would offer channels individually to customers on a so-called a la carte basis.  "Invasive program carriage obligations interfere with the ability of cable operators to package content," the Republican lawmakers said.	BumbleBeeBoogie	oppose	 false

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	FCC Sets Media-Heavy Nov. 27 Public Meeting FCC Sets Media-Heavy Nov. 27 Public Meeting RELATED ARTICLES Republican FCC Chairman Martin Needs Help from Democrats  NCTA: Multicast Must-Carry Is No Boon to Minorities Agenda Includes Video-Competition Report, Media-Ownership Review (Minus Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership), Broadcaster Reporting Requirements  By John Eggerton -- Broadcasting &amp; Cable, 11/20/2007 4:43:00 PM The Federal Communications Commission released the agenda for its Nov. 27 meeting, and it's loaded with media items.  As expected, chairman Kevin Martin scheduled a vote for a release of the video-competition report, which means that he either has the two Democratic commissioners lined up, since the Republicans expressed their concerns about an FCC finding that cable has met a deregulatory threshold, or he adjusted the item.  Republican commissioner Robert McDowell said Monday that he could vote to approve the report if the so-called 70/70 threshold part were deleted.  Commissioner Deborah Taylor Tate also expressed reservations about the data the FCC used to come up with its conclusion, as has the cable industry en masse, which said its subscriber counts and household penetration have actually gone down with competition from satellite-TV providers and telephone companies.  Others -- Media Access Project, most notably -- said, as MAP said in a letter to the FCC Tuesday, that the 70/70 test has been met and that powerful cable operators have "squeezed out independent minority and religious programming."  The commission is also scheduled to vote on the media-ownership review that has been ongoing for years, but not the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership part, since the chairman is accepting comments on that proposal through Dec. 11 and is expected to vote on that Dec. 18 unless Congress applies sufficient pressure to delay that timetable.  While the agenda does not spell out specifics, the item is described as "concerning initiatives designed to increase participation in the broadcasting industry by new entrants and small businesses, including minority- and women-owned businesses."  That is likely the chairman's proposal to allow designated entities, including minorities, women, and small businesses, to lease digital broadcast spectrum from TV stations as a way to give them a broadcast "voice" without the entry costs of buying or building a station.  Minority advocates and Hill and FCC Democrats have been underwhelmed by the proposal, with some picking up on the phrase popularized by FCC commissioner Jonathan Adelstein that it is akin to spectrum "sharecropping." But Martin likely has two other Republican votes for the plan.  The chairman has also scheduled a vote on his proposal to increase broadcaster reporting requirements to include more detailed accounts of their public service.  Also on the agenda is an item to cut cable leased-access rights, perhaps by as much as 75%.	BumbleBeeBoogie	FCC	 false

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	While further posts from me may be pointless, given that Blatham has already described what George would say on this matter, let me briefly outline my basic thoughts.  Federal regulation of private actions is justifiable in certain circumstances to prevent grevious harm or injury to individuals or groups of people. In addition in certain circumstances preventive Federal regulation is justified to protect the public good in preventing gross distortion of markets or other processes on which the public depends and for which no other means are available. (Here the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission is a good example).  In general government regulation is recognized by our constitution as a generally undesirable thing, allowable only under certain circumstances and in support only of specifically named powers of government. It is explicitly excluded in numerous areas of life (notably including freedom of speech) as part of that same constitution. This is of course based on the principle that government processes too readily lend themselves to abuse through corruption, usurpation and the persistent venality of human nature when the power of government is in its hands.  The so-called fairness doctrine in broadcast communications was a direct result of the now obselete practical necessity of a government monopoly on access to instant mass communications, then available only through the broadcast frequency spectrum -- in past years with this the only instant means of wide area communication, chaos would surely result without such government control of access. Once government became the gate keeper, it became necessary to ensure that this power was exercised with impartiality and fairness. The fairness doctrine was initiated chiefly as a limitation on the government's actions in licensing broadcasters and preventing it from intentionally or merely inadvertantly allowing existing printy and other media entities from dominating the broadcast spectrum merely by virtue of their presence in the market.  Now, in an age of vastly improved signal density in the broadcast spectrum and of ubiquitous cable and internet networks that don't use the broadcast spectrum at all, the situation is entirely different. There is no longer a local shortage of broadcast spectral access, and equally effective alternate means of instantly accessing the same audience through the internet and cable networks that are quite beyond this regulatory regime are readily available to all. The justification for the regulatory regime and the attendant evils it permits, including particularly the inherent limitation of the freedom of speech it entails, no longer exists.  These are the arguments that were correctly used some years ago to eliminate the so-called "Fairness Doctrine" limiting public speech on the airways. Note that the issue before us now is the elimination of other equally obsolete and no longer justifiable government restrictions on the free enterprise of media companies and their owners. Given the fact that these rules apply only to a small part of mass media - those using the broadcast spectrum - the absurdity of the "fairness" arguments being offered in support of the return of these now obsolete, no longer justifiable restrictions on freedom of speech is obvious for all to see.  All of this leads the discerning observer to look deeper for the real motives behind this issue.  We have all seen Blatham's bland acceptance of the Turner Broadcasting empire or those of the Washington Post Co. or even the New York Times -- and the stark contrast with his fear of evil conspiracy behind the otherwise similar empire headed by Rupert Murdoch. I hesitate to suggest that the persistent success of Rush Limbach and lesser lights like Michael Savage in attracting and retaining a wide audience on radio stations owned by Clear Channel Communications, the Sinclair network and others may be behind this rather obvious attempt to silence a political voice he happens to dislike. However the evidence in this case is rather clear. This is an attempt to misuse the power of government to suppress the political speech of voices they oppose. It is all done with high-sounding rhetoric and vague appeals to virtue, but the motives and the goals are hardly different from those of the brownshirts who proceded them in this kind of forced suppression of disagreement.	georgeob1	quite	 false

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	I have no opinion whatever concerning the motives of most of the individuals involved in this debate. There are numerous central and side elements of the issue on which various actors can hang their hats.  However, in a world in which mass communications is increasingly dominated by the completely unregulated internet and cable networks, the attempt to single out a relatively small segment of broadcast networks for government regulation of both content and ownership, strikes me as absurd. The anti monopoly and fairness arguments offered in support of it are utterly enviscerated by the simple facts that the most ubiquitous mass communications networks are utterly unregulated by the FCC, and that the one segment they are attempting to restrain, broadcast networks, happens to be a favored venue of their political opponents.  Finally, the physical facts on which the constitutional justification of the former regulatory regime was based no longer exist in a world of HD radio, the internet, and cable radio &amp; TV. There is no longer any justification for this limitation on constitutionally guaranteed freedoms.  I have made my position clear. Perhaps Blatham would care to enlighten us with an explanation of just what is the logical basis for his advocacy of this continued infringement on individual freedom.	georgeob1	based	 false

After listening to "news," I need to hear the other side or a counter-balance.  A good example of the need for a balance was the CNN Democratic debate, which was scripted for Clinton, but was presented as balanced. If I view or hear something biased, I would at least like to hear the source admit to the bias, and all conservative talk show personalities that I know of admit that they present their views from a conservative bias. I can't tell you how many liberals I've heard that claim to be moderates or centrists, and it is nothing but their egotistical claim to being balanced, which is a crock to say the least.

If Air America had taken off and crushed Rush &amp; Co in the ratings, it is very unlikely that we would be hearing Democrats caterwauling about fairness on the air-waves, and if, in such a scenario, Republicans tried to bring back the Fairness Doctrine, I would find fault with them as well.  I'm feel fairly confident that blatham with contest this next statement, but the airwaves of America are open to all points of view.

Clearly the dismal failure of Liberal Talk-radio and the crowning achievement of Conservative Talk-radio is not a one for one representation of the political leanings of the American people. If it were, we would have very little to worry about Hilary residing in the White House yet again.  That it is not, only makes the efforts of Liberals to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine that much more (charitably) pathetic, and (reservedly) dangerous.

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	We may have finally hit on the central legal aspect of this issue.  The function of the FCC is not to administer anti trust law. It is instead to regulate the issuance of licenses to broadcast media. The fairness and ownership regulations that grew up with the FCC were designed in recognition of the fact that, at the time, some regulation of this (then, before HD radio) very limited spectral resource was a practical necessity, and that some rules to limit the government's behavior in inadverdantly biasing the content of or creating local monopolies on public media were needed to accomplish that regulation in a beneficial way.  The explosive growth of other unregulated media, notably including the internet, internet "radio", cable "radio" and TV, as well as the huge increase in the the available radio spectrum with HD radio broadcast, have profoundly altered the conditions that obtained when these now archaic regulations were created. Joe from Chicago has described these changes very well.  The Justice Department remains in charge of the enforcement of Anti Trust law, and the very large body of case law that has evolved with it. In no other aspect of our economy or society is Anti trust law made and enforced by an administrative agency such as the FCC. We have laws and courts, with the attendant appeal process to deal with these matters.  All this is a good example of the mindless rigidity of government. Bureaucracies, Agencies and rules tend to remain in place long after the reasons for them have passed from the scene. In this case Democrats are trying to extend the life of now pointless restrictons to liberty merely to silence some of their rather effective political critics. This is a clear attempt to abridge free speech for political purposes. It is merely hidden behind a lot of irrelevant rhetoric about non-existant monopolies.	georgeob1	agency	 false

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	FCC Chair Forced to Compromise on Cable Regulation FCC Chair Forced to Compromise on Cable Regulation By Frank Ahrens Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday, November 28, 2007; D01  The Federal Communications Commissions voted for a set of watered-down cable regulations late last night, as increasing tensions among the agency's five members allowed the industry to largely avoid tough rules.  Under the new regulations, cable companies will for the first time have to give the FCC the most complete data available on how many subscribers they have. The FCC also lowered the price that cable systems charge smaller programmers, such as religious community broadcasters, to lease space on unused cable channels.  Yesterday's meeting followed a flurry of late-night activity Monday and throughout the day Tuesday, as commissioners sparred with embattled FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin, who they say has rushed the commission toward unmerited action on cable and other issues.  The fight over new cable regulations was so contentious that yesterday's meeting began 12 hours after its scheduled start, as Martin and the four other commissioners edited and re-edited the proposals, and concluded after 11 p.m.  Martin is taking heat from the cable industry as well, which accuses him of unfairly trying to crack down. The industry says Martin is attempting regulatory maneuvers designed to achieve his ultimate goal: requiring cable companies to offer their channels on an a la carte basis, allowing subscribers to buy only the channels they want.  Martin has said consumers should not have to pay for channels they may find objectionable, such as MTV or FX. The cable industry says that adopting an a la carte system would actually raise prices and limit selection by forcing a number of lesser-watched channels off the air.  Leading up to last night's meeting, Martin fought with the cable industry and some commissioners over a new study he championed that suggests that more than 70 percent of Americans who can subscribe to large cable packages do so, opening the door for long-dormant federal regulations designed to keep cable companies from growing too big.  If it were determined that the 70 percent threshold has been met, the cable industry could face a raft of regulations, including a national ownership cap.  But after days of struggle, Martin capitulated last night and acknowledged that the new study may not be definitive enough to trigger new regulations. Instead, he and the four other commissioners compromised on a measure that would require the cable industry to provide more detailed information than it currently does on its number of subscribers.  "I think it's important that the commission is taking steps not only to try to provide the opportunity for diverse programmers to get on cable but also to make sure we're gathering the most accurate and reliable data to determine what conditions exist in the video industry today," Martin said in an interview last night.  Increasing tensions within the five-member commission boiled over leading up to last night's vote. Martin received the harshest criticism from fellow Republican commissioner Robert M. McDowell and Democrat Jonathan S. Adelstein.  Both said they were prevented from seeing the FCC's data on cable subscribers until they asked Martin's office for the data Monday night. They showed that only 54 percent of U.S. households that can get cable subscribe to large packages -- a number well below the 70 percent threshold required for new regulations.  "They're trying to hide the ball from their own team," Adelstein said in an interview last night. "That's why the data was suppressed -- because it conflicted with the outcome he sought."  Adelstein accused Martin's office of trying to "cook the books" to arrive at the 70 percent threshold.  McDowell called Martin's study "the only fig leaf that could be found to trigger an avalanche of unnecessary regulation" on the cable industry.  Last night, Martin said that nothing was suppressed and that he was trying to give fellow commissioners the most accurate data.  "We applaud the leadership of each commissioner who questioned and withstood the attempt to use incomplete data in order to justify greater regulation that is completely unwarranted by the competitive marketplace," said Kyle McSlarrow, president of the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association, the trade group of big cable companies.  The messy fight over cable has caused some to question Martin's leadership of the FCC.  Last week, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) sent a letter to Martin questioning his management style and asking how much time he had given the public to comment on certain issues and given fellow commissioners to study them.  "To maintain public confidence in the working of administrative agencies, it is critical that the agency decision-making process is transparent and open to public review and comment," Conyers wrote to Martin. "Yet recent media reports suggest that under your chairmanship, the FCC is conducting its decision-making in just the opposite manner."  An FCC official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of continued dealings with Martin, said: "We are getting a growing number of questions from the Hill asking about commission processes. There are a lot of legitimate concerns and problems."	BumbleBeeBoogie	Compromise	 false

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	Senate to examine FCC media rules Senate to examine FCC media rules By Brooks Boliek Dec 13, 2007  WASHINGTON -- FCC chairman Kevin Martin goes into the firing line again Thursday as the Senate Commerce Committee takes a hard look at his plans to reshape the media landscape.  Martin is likely to find himself under attack from both the left and the right over proposals he is pushing the commission to approve on Dec. 18 that would significantly unfetter media companies that wish to own both newspapers and TV stations in the same market, while at the same time he is pushing a rule that would prevent any cable company from serving more than 30% of pay-TV subscribers nationally  His push to alter the rules, in a particular the newspaper-TV station cross ownership ban, are garnering considerable controversy as no one seems to like the plan.  Broadcasters and newspaper publishers have criticized the Martin plan to allow one company to own a newspaper and TV station in the top 20 markets if the TV station is not among the top four stations in that city as being too tame. The Tribune Co., which has the most at stake in the cross-ownership battle, has asked the federal appeals court to strike down the order, even as Martin's proposal appeared to be a gift to the company which numbers the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and several TV stations among its properties.  The company argues that temporary waivers allowing the combinations should be permanent. The waivers were necessary because FCC rules generally prohibit one company from owning both a broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same market. The commission has allowed exceptions but does not permit any existing cross-media combinations to be transferred to new owners.  Tribune's lawsuit amounts to a legal maneuver to get the court strike down the cross-ownership ban entirely.  The FCC's waivers required Tribune to sell properties within two years or until six months after all litigation related to the agency's overall media ownership rules is complete, whichever takes longest  The affected combinations are in New York, Los Angeles, Hartford-New Haven, Conn., and Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Tribune received a permanent waiver in Chicago.  At the same time people who fear that easing the rule will concentrate too much media power in too little hands contend that the proposal is too bold.  In a late filing with the FCC a coalition of consumer groups attacked the proposal.  "Unless Chairman Martin remedies procedural flaws, eliminates dangerous and vague exceptions, and thoroughly expands meaningful minority ownership and local programming needs, his plan will not serve the public interest or meet minimum legal fairness requirements for FCC rules," said a statement from Free Press, Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union.  While the debate over media concentration issues does not break down exactly on party lines, more Democrats appear to support tougher controls than do Republicans.  Martin likely to run into a tough time before the committee as it has already approved legislation that would require the FCC to postpone action for up to six months.  The chairman's plan to impose the 30% ceiling on cable subscribers has also come under attack.  FCC Democrats Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein are expected to join Martin, giving him the 3-2 vote he needs to get it through the commission. It is unclear whether FCC Republicans Deborah Taylor Tate and Robert McDowell will end up voting with Martin.  The 30% cap was struck down by a federal court in 2001. Comcast has denounced Martin's cable ownership cap as totally unjustified given a video market that is far more competitive today than it was six years ago. Comcast is highly likely to take the FCC to court.  In another late filing with the commission, Comcast argued that imposing a de-facto ownership limit on cable operators while lifting the newspaper-TV cross ownership ban makes no sense.  "The very same types of concerns that appear to be animating the chairman's proposal to relax the newspaper-broadcast cross ownership rule compel the conclusion that a 30% cap on cable ownership can no longer be justifies," the company wrote.

Martin endured three hours of aggressive questioning from the Senate Commerce Committee, with lawmakers accusing him of rushing to help big media companies at the expense of the public.  Kevin J. Martin tells senators that adopting new rules for media cross-ownership will help newspapers.  WASHINGTON -- Facing growing criticism of his agenda and tactics, a defiant Kevin J. Martin, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, refused senators' requests Thursday to delay a vote next week on his plan to loosen restrictions on owning a newspaper and broadcast station in the same city.  Martin endured three hours of aggressive questioning from the Senate Commerce Committee, with members accusing him of rushing to help big media companies at the public's expense.  "If you move ahead and do it, you're a braver man than I am," said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). She accused Martin of having an "obsession" with changing media ownership rules that was distracting the FCC from the more important issue of guiding the nation's 2009 transition to digital television.  Amid complaints from within the commission and Capitol Hill about a lack of openness at the FCC, Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) called for Congress next year to overhaul the agency's procedures and alter its deregulatory bent.  "I am becoming increasingly concerned that the FCC appears to be more concerned about making sure the policies they advocate serve the needs of the companies that they regulate and their bottom lines rather than the public interest," Rockefeller said. "We cannot allow this to happen."  Martin was grilled about pushing the FCC to vote Tuesday on his plan to ease a 32-year-old restriction on the ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market. Martin wants to lift the so-called cross-ownership ban in the top 20 U.S. markets and allow such combinations in smaller markets if the FCC determines that they would be in the public interest.  Critics say the FCC chairman is moving too fast and failing to take into account public opposition to the plan. Asked by Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) if he would delay the vote, Martin replied, "No."  Martin, a Republican, said the FCC had been reviewing its ownership rules for 18 months and that the commission needed to act to help the financially struggling newspaper industry.  He said he was open to making revisions to his proposal, such as tightening what critics have called loose standards for determining if a newspaper/broadcast combination would produce more local news.  But when Kerry urged him to seek consensus on cross-ownership before voting on a rule change, Martin responded, "I'm not convinced on media ownership there ever will be consensus."  Lawmakers and public interest groups had expected the FCC's periodic review of its media ownership rules to extend into next year. But Martin accelerated the process in October, rushing to hold the final two public hearings with minimal notice and proposing to vote on a plan Tuesday, just a week after public comments were due at the FCC.  The moves outraged the FCC's two Democrats, Michael J. Copps and Jonathan S. Adelstein, as well as many members of Congress, who accused Martin of short-circuiting the process.  Fearing the consequences of more media consolidation, they said the FCC first should complete a long-pending review of ways to ensure that broadcasters serve their local communities and take steps to increase ownership of radio and TV stations by women and minorities.  The Senate Commerce Committee unanimously approved legislation last week that would force at least a six-month delay in the cross-ownership vote and summoned Martin and the other commissioners to testify.  "The FCC is poised to make some bad decisions, and it seems to me at this point only congressional oversight can get us back on track," Copps said, acknowledging that Martin had the votes on the five-member commission to approve the rule change.  After the FCC recently granted waivers to Tribune Co. of the cross-ownership rule in Los Angeles and four other cities, allowing it to close its $8.2-billion deal to go private by year-end, Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said there was no reason to rush a vote on such a controversial issue.  "Why give us an argument to attack you all?" Lott said. "I would plead with you to take a little more time."	BumbleBeeBoogie	refuses	 false

However the issue has not been taken up by the full Senate and no companion bill has been introduced in the House. </quote> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/mediaNews/idUSN1324303220071213?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0">http://www.reuters.com/article/mediaNews/idUSN1324303220071213?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0</a> </quote>  You are correct. At most the Committee can promise revenge in subsequent legislative actions. Very likely Martin knows full well he won't be around in the next term and is therefore thoroughly immune to their threats. Undoing this action - even with a Democrat Congress and Administration - will have its political costs, so the battle is well worth the fight now.  Sometimes Bernie the forces of freedom, light and happy virtue triumph over those of regulation, tyranny and darkness.	georgeob1	Bernie	 false

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	yup  Congress Asks FCC to Answer Questions about Private Equity Ownership of Media Properties In March, we wrote about the concurring opinion of Commissioner Copps in connection with the sale of Univision Communications, where the Commissioner asked whether it was in the public interest to allow the sale of broadcast companies to private equity firms. That theme has now been picked up by Congress, as Congressman John Dingell, Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Ed Markey, Chairman of the Telecommunications Subcommittee, jointly sent a letter to the FCC asking for answers to a series of questions about the impact of private equity ownership of media and telecommunications facilities. The letter, here, cites the Univision case, the acquisition of Clear Channel and the sale of a number of Radio One radio stations to private equity firms, and suggests that these firms may be more interested in cutting expenses and maximizing profits to the detriment of the public interest. The letter asks a number of questions about whether the FCC has adequate information about such ownership to assess its impact on the public interest.  The questions posed by the letter include the following:  Whether the FCC currently tracks ownership of media properties by private equity companies. Whether the FCC has assessed the impact of private equity ownership on localism and, if it has not, should it Whether the FCC has adequate information to assess the impact of media ownership by these companies on multiple ownership considerations Whether the Commission's Equity-Debt Plus rules need to be revised to take account of private equity ownership If the ownership of these entities is sufficiently public and transparent for the Commission to review that ownership. The letter was addressed to Chairman Martin, and he was given until July 20 in which to respond.  As we wrote before, one wonders if the Commission has the manpower and expertise to assess the true impact of private equity in the broadcast field. How could the Commission make distinctions between private equity funds and other companies that provide financing and investment to broadcast entities? Don't all companies have the same incentive to maximize profits? Various banks, finance companies and investment funds have invested in broadcast properties forever, and the Commission's rules seem to have been able to deal with such investment without serious problem. Why would these investment vehicles be any different? The Commission has rules, like the Equity-Debt Plus rules that limit the financial investments that companies can have in competing media outlets. One would think that the enforcement of these rules would be sufficient to govern any potential for anitcompetitive effects of private equity. Similarly, private equity should not affect localism any more than any other non-local management.  Nevertheless, these issues will no doubt be considered in the upcoming proceedings on localism and multiple ownership (whenever those issues are ultimately considered by the FCC). As Congress examines the role of private equity in other sectors of the economy, expect that these issues won't disappear anytime in the near future.	Stradee	whether	 false

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	Divided FCC Enacts Rules On Media Ownership Divided FCC Enacts Rules On Media Ownership By Frank Ahrens Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday, December 19, 2007; D01  The Federal Communications Commission relaxed one media-ownership rule yesterday and held the line on another. Both decisions are likely to be challenged in federal court.  By a 3 to 2, party-line vote, the commission partially lifted a 32-year-old ban that prevents a newspaper owner from also owning a radio or television station in the same city.  In a separate, 3 to 2, split-party vote, the FCC reestablished a national cable television ownership ceiling at 30 percent, meaning one company cannot have more than 30 percent of all cable subscribers.  The meeting lasted more than three hours and included some heated language among commissioners. One, Michael J. Copps, called the newspaper-broadcast ruling "today's terrible decision."  The partial lifting of the ban would allow a newspaper in one of the nation's top 20 media markets to merge with a radio or television station in the same market, as long as the television station is not among the four highest-rated in that city. Mergers could occur in smaller markets, but they would have to pass a number of tests, including a demonstration that the newspaper was in financial distress.  The commission also approved waivers in a number of cities, including Phoenix and Myrtle Beach, S.C., that will allow existing newspaper-television combinations to continue.  The relaxation of the so-called cross-ownership rule was championed by FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin and supported by his fellow Republican commissioners, Robert M. McDowell and Deborah Taylor Tate. Copps and fellow Democratic commissioner Jonathan S. Adelstein opposed it.  Adelstein called the new rule "a monumental mistake" and, with Copps, called it a gift to media companies that will enable consolidation and restrict the diversity of voices on the airwaves.  Martin responded by taking the unusual step of directly addressing Copps's and Adelstein's complaints that the process was conducted without sufficient public comment, citing instances in the past where he said each of them had negotiated deals that were outside the public's view. Martin said he would never achieve a commission consensus on media ownership and that Copps and Adelstein were determined to delay action on the matter to avoid a resolution.  "I don't raise these issues to attack any of my colleagues," Martin said, detailing the many months of study that led to yesterday's vote. "Every time as I was crossing the goal line, the goal posts were moved."  The cross-ownership rule met with criticism from Sens. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) and Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) and some anti-consolidation groups. All said the rule would lead to fewer local voices in news and information.  Kerry and other senators have threatened congressional action to overturn the cross-ownership rule or deny federal funding to the FCC to implement it.  Proponents of the rule change said it would mean more local news, with television stations drawing on newspaper reports and newspapers able to offset the cost of newsgathering with television advertising revenue.  Newspaper companies fought hard for the rule change five years ago, but showed less interest in it this time because of changing market conditions in the television business. In the past, newspapers saw the high profits of television stations and envisioned significant cost-saving synergies between the properties. But that strategy was crippled by the rise of Internet video, which ate away at newspaper readers, television viewers, and the revenue of both mediums.  The Newspaper Association of America offered mild applause to the cross-ownership ruling. It is "a baby step in the actions needed to maintain the vitality of local news, in print and over-the-air, in all communities across the nation," association President John F. Sturm said in a written statement.  This was the FCC's second attempt to relax the rule. A broader attempt in 2003 was remanded to the FCC by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia, which said the agency did not adequately justify its reasoning. The new rule is expected to face legal challenge from a number of groups, including the Media Access Project.  A 30 percent national cable ownership cap was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit several years ago. Yesterday, Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, with about 27 percent of all subscribers, predicted that it would be reversed in court again, calling the FCC vote "perverse."  Copps and Adelstein joined Martin in voting for the ownership cap, while Tate and McDowell opposed it.  In an interview, Copps predicted that yesterday's vote would withstand a court challenge because the FCC has better justified its reasoning.	BumbleBeeBoogie	Divided	 false

Federal Communications Commission	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6842924	Bernie, here's the latest info {i've read} regarding Senate action  Senate Rejects Media Consolidation By Christopher Kuttruff t r u t h o u t | Report  Friday 16 May 2008  On Thursday night, the US Senate initiated the process of overturning an FCC ruling made in December to allow for greater media consolidation.  The joint resolution (S.J Res. 28) passed by an overwhelming margin in a voice vote on the Senate floor.  The resolution, originally sponsored by Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-North Dakota), was cosponsored by Sens. Hillary Clinton (D-New York), Barack Obama (D-Illinois), Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), and a long list of others.  "Today, the Senate stood up to Washington special interests by voting to reverse the FCC's disappointing media consolidation rules that I have fought against," said presidential candidate Barack Obama. "It is essential that the FCC promotes the public interest and diversity in ownership."  Senator Dorgan's communications director Justin Kitsch noted to Truthout, "The next step is for the House to take up the resolution. Senator Dorgan certainly hopes it will move quickly."  Congressman Jay Inslee (D-Washington) has introduced a measure similar to Dorgan's in the House.  The vote demonstrated a strong rebuke of the FCC's controversial rule, (FCC 07-216), which eliminated the 1975 ban on a company from owning both a newspaper and broadcast outlet within a single market.  "The FCC is supposed to be a referee for the media industry, but instead they've been cheerleaders in favor of more consolidation," Dorgan said in a statement regarding the Senate resolution. "Diverse, independent and local media sources are essential to ensuring that the public has access to a variety of information."  The FCC's decisions in December, and its policies since early in the Bush administration, have drawn a flood of criticism from individuals angered by what they see as an irresponsible and partisan stance of broad deregulation.  Chairman Kevin Martin has been accused of divisive leadership, lacking in accountability and transparency.  Martin has become the subject of a Congressional investigation headed by Congressmen John Dingell (D-Michigan) and Bart Stupak (D-Michigan).  Staff members of the FCC voiced their discontent with Martin's tenure in a memo to Dingell and Stupak. "The bottom line is that the FCC process appears broken and most of the blame appears to rest with Chairman Martin," the memo said.  The December FCC ruling on media ownership was split 3-2 along party lines and prompted fervent disapproval from citizens and government officials (both Republicans and Democrats). STOPBIGMEDIA.com claimed that the Senate received thousands of calls and around 250,000 letters urging response to the FCC's actions.  "The FCC must not be allowed to relax its media cross-ownership rules," Dorgan said. "More consolidation means fewer choices for consumers, and that is not in the public's best interest. There has been massive public outcry to these new rules, and they must be overturned."  President Bush has threatened to veto any legislation that overturns the FCC's decision.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------	Stradee	overturning	 false

The ratings for the Obama sympathizing media have followed the same path as Obama's fall from grace, they have lost trust, dignity and all sense of balance. They show the desperation, lack of understanding and shock that the progressive movement went sour with a great percentage of the American people. They also have developed a habit of hurling insults and undermining the average American citizen just for wanting to be involved.	Lumpy 1	whined	 false

Now watch the SAME PEOPLE who use gay as a PERJORATIVE, just about explode with outrage over that!  Read the sig. It's only okay to be offensive to conservatives. It's not okay to be offensive to liberals.  Self righteous hypocritical PHONIES!  AND I BET YOU STUPID LIBS THOUGHT YOU THOROUGHLY INTIMIDATED ME INTO NEVER DOING THAT AGAIN!

While he did note violence is the last resort, it is one that he believes will ultimately become a part of the American DNA. Ratigan met his ideas with placid approval.

That means that since the voter will do what they want, violence should be used against us to FORCE us to do what they want.  "Reform the process" means the Constitutional system allowed people to vote them out of power. They don't like that!

It's a serious question. You are taking one sentence out of her comments to support your blind views. What the fuck did she mean by the bold part in the following quote, "I hope that's not where we're going, but, you know, if this Congress keeps going the way it is, people are really looking toward those Second Amendment remedies and saying my goodness what can we do to turn this country around? I'll tell you the first thing we need to do is take Harry Reid out."  The second amendment refers to the right to bear arms. She hopes that isn't where we are going......but if Congress keeps going the way it is.......people are looking towards remedying the situation with their guns......and asking what they can do to turn things around......followed immediately by......the first thing we need to do is take Harry Reid out. Was she talking about the election process in her comments? No. Was she talking about armed insurrection to turn the country around and the need to take out Reid? Yes.  Just once TPS.....just once......do us conservatives proud and be fucking honest. Take the tin foil hat off and come out of the backyard bunker and be "fair and balanced".  </quote>  The problem with Angle is, she thinks they are all just as educated as she is and would understand the comment.  As usual, she was not taking into account how stupid and ignorant liberals are, of their own history.  <quote> God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion.  The people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty.... And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to the facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure." Thomas Jefferson  </quote>  This is what she was referring to. Obviously, Angle's rhetorical citing of this, and her allusion to taking Reid out at the ballot box is lost on you.  If she seriously meant shooting Reid, why hasn't she tried to do so since Reid won?  Why hasn't the Tea Party?  Because it was never about armed resistance but resistance at the ballot box.  But Rall and the MSNBC commentator aren't talking resistance at the ballot box, THE ELECTION IS OVER!  They are talking violence NOW THAT THE ELECTION IS OVER AND THEY LOST!  QUITE THE DIFFERENT THING!  Of course, you are going to go on desperately trying to say they are the same thing, but dividing line of the ACTUAL ELECTION will always stand against that nonsense.  Had Rall said this before the election, in allusions to voting, no one would object.  BUT AFTER THE VOTING IS DONE and they lost?  Quite the different thing and you know it, or would know it, if you had an honest bone in your body.

They're so ignorant, dumb that they throw these challenges out there (for example, "show me where liberals are violent! Go on and show me!

Always civil, the areas always cleaned up after every event with merely average folks looking out for the good of their country. In other words, tea party = patriots. If you could give me some solid examples of some instances where the tea party attendees have brought violence, I'd be amazed, as there are absolutely none.  Now for examples of home grown violence from the left...  -Out of 30 attempts of home grown terrorist attacks in the US since 9/11, 1/3rd of them have come from those on the left. You don't hear it because of... drum roll please..... OUR WONDERFUL MEDIA!!! -Yes, you're correct in bringing up the WTO in Seattle. -And let's not forget the G20 meetings? Those are always fun... -Major Nidal Malik Hasan and the recent Fort Hood shootings. -David Coleman Headley, an American who was arrested for planning the murder of the Danish Cartoonist a couple of years back. -William Ayres. Enough said. -Then there is that little punk from the San Fran area. That little rich punk- John Linden what's his face. Although not domestic violence, he was certainly headed in that direction and would have gladly killed fellow Americans on American soil if given the chance. In fact, he did end up shooting one of our own, only it was done overseas. -Then there is John bedell, the democrat who went down as the "holocaust museum shooter." -And let's not forget the ECO-terrorists who go around blowing up Humvees. The group ELF ring a bell? -James Blanning. The lib who placed the bombs made from gas and a cell phone trigger with a note that ranted on about Bush and Cheney. -The weathermen group, led by the aforementioned- Bill Ayers. PS, he now is a professor at yet another one of America's wonderful elite college establishments. -Carol Burger. The nut who stabbed her roommate to death with a screwdriver after getting so worked up at a Palin rally. Yeah, she hated Palin that much! -ALF or animal liberation front... they'll blow up just about anything and go as far as burning down the actual animal clinics they claim to be doing all this for! -Then there are those who showed up to Ann Coulter's college invite this year. They threatened her life and chased her and her body guard off the campus. The campus invited Ann to speak. Nice. -The olympics this year in Canada? Remember that fun time? All the whinning Canadian dopey socialists running around blowing up random stuff, flipping cars and breaking store windows all in the name of "anti capitalism". As usual, when asked by the reporters "what point you're trying to prove", they rambled on about how capitalism ruined their lives and how Che Guevera and Mao Tsetung are their "guys". Funny how they always keep their faces covered with black masks. If they were so proud of their actions, why bother trying to keep yourself concealed? Hey dopes, I've got news for you. Even if you were 'anti capitalists', is blowing stuff up and destroying everything in site, costing people tons of money who have done nothing wrong, the way to go about it? I love the thought process on the left! Wait a minute, there isn't one! -And how about all the nuts in the Obama administration? For starters, Van Jones, the avowed communist who calls for revolution just about every time his fat mug is on tv. Then there is Anita Dunn, whose favors Mao Tsetung in her top 5 list. Then there is Cass Sunstein. How could we forget him? A proud advocate of population control through eugenics. John Holdren says the same. -Ed Shultz, that idiot on MSNBC or some dopey radio station, who screams, rants and raves about kicking in the teeth of conservatives. Wonderful person. Perhaps he should focus more on eating less donuts instead of worrying about kicking people's teeth in. Oh would I love to hear him say he'd like to kick my teeth in... fat pile of guano! -Then there is the black panthers who show up with clubs and threaten people in PA during the 2008 elections. -And let's not forget the ACORN, ALF CIO and SEIU who send their thugs to rallys where they beat up on conservative African Americans this year. -How about the idiot liberals who show up at the funerals of fallen soldiers and try to start fights? -How about, how about, how about....??????  And let's not forget that every major war has been fought with democratic/liberal presidents. Wilson, WW1. FDR and Truman, WW2 and then the Truman and the Korean war. Then we have Eisenhower, a republican, who gets the country out of war with Korea. Then Kennedy ends up escalating US involvement with Vietnam only to have his brother, Ted set the agenda for the early pull out which led to the slaughter of approximately 2.5 million Vietnamese. Nice. Truman drops a bomb on the Japanese. Wasn't enough. He then takes us right into war with Korea. Must really hate those Asians! And don't forget the racism that comes from the left. The fact that it was the left that started the KKK, it was the left that embraced and started jim crow laws, it was the left that fought AGAINST civil rights acts... all to keep their agenda in place. The agenda that tricks people into thinking the left is some how this compassionate machine that can take care of everybody when in fact, the truth is compassion on the left doesn't exist and the sole purpose of those in power on the left is to race bait and create classes based on any and everything that separates us as humans- race, gender, poverty level, skill level and anything else they can think of. This way, they control the entire game. It's in plain site. But unfortunately many on the left have been dubbed into believing otherwise. Idiots. True idiots.  And the list goes on and on and on and on...  I'm sure you could grab an example of a crazy right winger, perhaps 1 example, maybe even 2 on a good day but that's it. You know why? Cause you people on the left come from a different mold. And in general, those on the right feel as though they have a higher being "GOD" to explain things to when the pass over. This keeps them in line more so than those on the left who are generally unscrupulous atheists with an overall evil agenda. You're classless, shameless and moral-less thugs who claim to care for people through the redistribution of other people's money. Wonderful. Like a bunch of spoiled 16 year olds who get their first car from daddy and wreck it into a tree. Why should you care about a car that you didn't pay for? Same simple theory. Why would you care about money that you didn't earn? Not to mention, when you throw in the fact that liberals don't understand simple economics, when you throw in the fact that liberals don't grasp simple ideas like "you can't raise minimum wage across the board and expect that major layoffs don't occur!", it just makes things even worse. Go ahead, give me some examples of some solid cases in which you can put a finger on some issues where violence came from the right? You can't. I guarantee you, you CANNOT. I'm not talking about one or two issues that happened 30 years ago either. I want issues. I want to see if you can show me a pattern of violence, as I've done with the above examples. Libs really have mental issues. They just don't get it. Which makes them stupid. And for those who do get it, well then they're just evil. If you don't get it because you're a dope, then shame on you. If you do get it but you let your ego get in the way of admitting you've been incorrect all these years, then you're worse than a dope. You're evil. If you let your ego get in the way what's right for the country, you're evil. Plain and simple. Now, get outta here you dopey numnut libs!	liberals r evil	idiot	 false

Humane Society of the United States	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-193260-6567673	Despite the words "humane society" on its letterhead, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) is not affiliated with your local animal shelter. Despite the omnipresent dogs and cats in its fundraising materials, it's not an organization that runs spay/neuter programs or takes in stray, neglected, and abused pets. And despite the common image of animal protection agencies as cash-strapped organizations dedicated to animal welfare, HSUS has become the wealthiest animal rights organization on earth.  HSUS is big, rich, and powerful, a "humane society" in name only. And while most local animal shelters are under-funded and unsung, HSUS has accumulated $113 million in assets and built a recognizable brand by capitalizing on the confusion its very name provokes. This misdirection results in an irony of which most animal lovers are unaware: HSUS raises enough money to finance animal shelters in every single state, with money to spare, yet it doesn't operate a single one anywhere.  Instead, HSUS spends millions on programs that seek to economically cripple meat and dairy producers; eliminate the use of animals in biomedical research labs; phase out pet breeding, zoos, and circus animal acts; and demonize hunters as crazed lunatics. HSUS spends $2 million each year on travel expenses alone, just keeping its multi-national agenda going.  HSUS president Wayne Pacelle described some of his goals in 2004 for The Washington Post: "We will see the end of wild animals in circus acts  [and we're] phasing out animals used in research. Hunting? I think you will see a steady decline in numbers." More recently, in a June 2005 interview, Pacelle told Satya magazine that HSUS is working on "a guide to vegetarian eating, to really make the case for it." A strict vegan himself, Pacelle added: "Reducing meat consumption can be a tremendous benefit to animals."  Shortly after Pacelle joined HSUS in 1994, he told Animal People (an inside-the-movement watchdog newspaper) that his goal was to build "a National Rifle Association of the animal rights movement." And now, as the organization's leader, he's in a position to back up his rhetoric with action. In 2005 Pacelle announced the formation of a new "Animal Protection Litigation Section" within HSUS, dedicated to "the process of researching, preparing, and prosecuting animal protection lawsuits in state and federal court."  HSUS's current goals have little to do with animal shelters. The group has taken aim at the traditional morning meal of bacon and eggs with a tasteless "Breakfast of Cruelty" campaign. Its newspaper op-eds demand that consumers "help make this a more humane world [by] reducing our consumption of meat and egg products." Since its inception, HSUS has tried to limit the choices of American consumers, opposing dog breeding, conventional livestock and poultry farming, rodeos, circuses, horse racing, marine aquariums, and fur trapping.	cjhsa	affiliated	 false

This is the Charity Navigator mission statement:  Charity Navigator works to guide intelligent giving. We help charitable givers make intelligent giving decisions by providing information on over five thousand charities and by evaluating the financial health of each of these charities. We ensure our evaluations are widely used by making them easy to understand and available to the public free of charge. By guiding intelligent giving, we aim to advance a more efficient and responsive philanthropic marketplace, in which givers and the charities they support work in tandem to overcome our nation's most persistent challenges.  Charity Navigator is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization under the Internal Revenue Code and does not accept any contributions from any charities we evaluate.  If you attempt to get an evaluation on the National Rifle Association at Charity Navigator, you get the following message:  We don't evaluate National Rifle Association.  Why not? We don't evaluate 501(c)(4) organizations because they are allowed to spend a substantial portion of their revenue on lobbying our government and not every donation to them is tax-deductible. You may be interested in our evaluation for The NRA Foundation.  The Charity Navigator does rate the NRA Foundation very highly.  The HSUS spends more than 75% of their money on programs. Their fundraising efficiency is given as $0.13, which means they spend 13 cents for every dollar they raise--anyone familiar with charitable organizations and fund-raising for charitable organizations will recognize that this is an extremely low efficiency rating, which means the HSUS is very efficient at raising funds without spending the money raised on the fund-raising process. The fund-raising efficiency of the NRA Foundation is $0.05, which is even more impressive.  In both cases, the efficiency of the fund-raising is likely a product of regular donations by interested parties which do not require the expense of solicitation.  ******************************************  This is the second time i've done this research and trotted out the results in response to a rant by Cjhsa. It seems he likes to trot out this obsession now and again, and i will always be happy to point to this information when he does. In case anyone missed the implications, the National Rifle Association was not rated because it is not a charitable organization--the Humane Society of the United States, however, is a charitable organization.

I strongly agree with Dr. Robert Miller, who states that "animals do not have rights; humans have responsibilities". I can't say it better than that.

Brown Berets	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8810166	Sent: Monday, July 18, 2005 2:26 PM Subject: BULLETIN! Reinforcements needed in Campo, Ca.  Dear Americans,  Reinforcements are needed in Campo, Ca. immediately to support Jim Chase's California Minutemen, who have deployed for border observation and reporting activities from July 16 through at least August 7 (and beyond).  I visited Jim Chase's group, accompanied with a California state senator and his aides, last Saturday. We witnessed the literal seige of VFW Post #2080 by about 60 belligerant, death-threatening anti-Americans twice during that day. The hate-spewing members of the racist, American-hating organization known as the Mexican brown berets, stormed the VFW Lodge, damaging signs and other property. They were eventually repelled by the late-arriving San Diego County Sheriff's Dept. No arrests were made.  The California state senator and his aides took serious note of the hostilities and violence conducted by the Nazi-like, anarchist brown berets. Americans...these goons are incurably evil and have a history of routinely suppressing the First Amendment rights of Americans through acts of violence and threats of death.  Our First Amendment rights of freedom to peacefully assemble and speak are in serious jeopardy, and it is time a stand is taken to preserve these rights.  The rampage was orchestrated by Armando Navarro, a known anti-American racist, who holds a comfortable, taxpayer funded, tenured position as a professor (of hate and blood-letting?) at the University of California - Riverside, Ca., and who has devoted his life to promoting the Mexican conquest of the seven southwestern US states. He calls for the conquest to be carried out by force, if necessary. Navarro, and his minions whose combined IQ was that of a dead house plant, all appeared to be under the influence of drugs.  One California Minuteman volunteer, Jim Woods, was physically assaulted by a gang of ten of Navarro's thugs as he sat in his car alone at a border outpost. He was physically restrained in his car seat by the brown berets, who threatened to kill him. They stole his keys from the ignition and left him stranded without food or water for several hours. When Jim Woods identified two of the gang members to the Sheriff's Dept. and asked for an arrest, no action was taken by the Sheriff's deputies. One deputy just responded to Mr. Wood's plea for help with "Oh, you just lost your keys," despite repeated pleas to the contrary from Mr. Woods.  I am returning to Campo this week. Volunteers from anywhere in the United States are welcome to join me as soon as possible. Two minuteman groups from Texas have already committed to arrive this week. I am also requesting reinforcements from Chris Simcox's Minuteman Civil Defense Corps in Tombstone, Az. and from select members of another well-known California border watch group that operates independently from The Minuteman Project.  Navarro's anarchist's attempted to shut down, and trash, the VFW lodge because the lodge allowed thirsty and hungry California Minutemen volunteers to purchase food and water from its restaurant. Their attempts to bring down the U.S. flag were thwarted by Jim Chase's California Minutemen.  Our goals here are twofold:  1. Protect the rights of ALL Americans to freely and peacefully assemble without being physically assaulted, or threatened with violence to maim or kill them by the mindless minions of the Univ. of California's "Professor of Hate", Armando Navarro.  2. Protect America's war veterans at VFW Lodge 2080, in Campo, Ca. from being battered by literal thugs with clubs and to protect the property of that lodge from being destroyed.  3. Simultaneously, volunteers are forming to protest at the Univ. of Ca. - Riverside, demanding the ouster of Navarro from his department at a state funded institution, which Navarro has selfishly turned into a department of tyranny.  Americans, saddle up! Let's Roll! Contact California Minutemen in Campo, Ca. at 760-272-0525...asap. The VFW lodge address is 301 Sheridan in Campo, Ca.  Ca. Minuteman Web Site: <a href="http://www.californiaminutemen.com">www.californiaminutemen.com</a>  Be warned that the roving gangs of adversaries engaging the California Minutemen WILL physically attack you if they outnumber you. I repeat, they WILL physically attack you. Stay in groups, and stay LEGALLY armed with pepper spray...tasers...etc. Sidearms are legal in certain areas in Campo. Confer with Jim Chase on the issue of sidearms. I am remaining unarmed, but will have legally armed body guards with me while I am in Campo.  Remember, remain passive. However, that does not mean you cannot defend yourself against threats to your safety by incoherrent mobs of gangsters who are determined to do you physical harm.  It truly is a sad day in America when the First Amendment rights are preserved only for those who carry the biggest stick. The alternative is to remain a cringing little mouse and forever relinquish your unalienable rights to peacefully speak or assemble.  Good Luck, Americans. May God, patriotism, and country be with you. See you in Campo.

The American Civil Liberties Union	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181109-51663	You are right Willow. But this suit is about a public school; not a private university. My primary concern is that there is a concerted effort by the ACLU and other "civil rights lawyers" that is purposefully eroding respect for authority. Kids have a hard enough time accepting that adults have certain rights, privilieges, and responsibilities that are different than children. And if adults condone ANY and ALL behavior on the behalf of children's "constitutional rights", we are headed for big, big trouble in this country. It's moral relativism.	chanel	lawyers	 false

The American Civil Liberties Union	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181109-51663	My impression of the ACLU is not that they are anti-Christianity. I do think some of their cases about religion and state have been petty. However, I think the reason for this is not because the ACLU is ant-Christianity. In the 50s through the 70s the ACLU did heroic work in civil rights and enforcement of our Bill of Rights (which includes free speech and freedom to practice any religion we individually desire).  Once these egregious violations of the Bill of Rights died down, the ACLU had fewer and fewer cases so they considered complaints about city logos and displays in state buildings, for example, that to you and me seem petty.  With the popularity of anti hate speech laws elsewhere in the world (and at the UN), we've seen this sort of 'that's hate speech' rhetoric pop up more frequently in discussions. There seems to be a growing support for hate speech laws. Because of this, I think the ACLU may once again have some cases where fundamental protections of our free speech should be applauded.

The family of Jeffrey Curley of Cambridge claims in its lawsuit that the North American Man/Boy Love Association and its Web site incited the molestation and murder of the boy in 1997.  The Massachusetts chapter of the ACLU said Thursday it will defend NAMBLA because the group's activities are protected under First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of association.  "Under the First Amendment, there are no illegal ideas. Those who commit illegal acts can be punished for wrongful conduct, but the expression of even offensive ideas is protected by our Constitution," the ACLU said in a statement.  The ACLU has long accepted unpopular clients and despised causes, including Ku Klux Klansmen and neo-Nazis. In 1977, the ACLU defended the right of Nazis to march in Skokie, Ill.  home to many Holocaust survivors. Thousands of ACLU members quit and contributions plunged.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20000831/aponline171914_000.htm">ACLU To Represent NAMBLA</a>  ManTwat!

In other words, as paraphrased by biographer William Donohue, who conducted extensive interviews with Baldwin before his death, "The occasional defense of right-wing extremists opens up the courts, thereby making it easier for the ACLU to defend its ideological kinfolk on the left."

Maybe, but what if they stand to benefit from such moves? Corporations? I don't think so, altruism isn't big in business. So it comes down to an organisation like the ACLU in the absence of other organisations. Yes some organisations such as the AFL-CIO might well take a case up but it will not be in the general interest, only the specific interests of the organisation.

That ban become the first state ban to be defeated on the ballot, in Nov. 2006.  Now this bill is specifically crafted to criminalize the activities of Minutemen, including the vast majority who do nothing but sit on the border, and call the Border Patrol when they see something. The hook is, of course, if even one of the Minutemen has ANY KIND of weapon at the time (sidearm, pocketknife, boxcutter or etc.), then the entire group are now "domestic terrorists", including the ones on another part of the border twenty miles away who don't even have a sharpened pencil.

Aren't you?  -----------------------------------------  <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com">http://www.worldnetdaily.com</a>  Law would make Minutemen Guilty of 'domestic terrorism'  'Patrolling to detect alleged illegal activity' while carrying any weapon would be felony  By Jay Baggett Posted: January 20, 2007 1:00 a.m. Eastern © 2007 WorldNetDaily. com  An Arizona lawmaker has introduced a bill to revise the state's statutes on organized crime and fraud by defining "domestic terrorism" in such a way that members of the Minuteman Project or other border-patrol groups could be prosecuted and forced to serve a minimum six-month jail term.  Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Phoenix, introduced HB 2286 in the Arizona House on Thursday.  Sinema, formerly of the Green Party, had earlier submitted a bill asking the legislature to make changes to a law used to prosecute customers of immigrant smugglers as conspirators under Arizona's human trafficking law.  "None of us every dreamed it would be used in a co-conspirator fashion," Sinema said.  As WND reported, it was federal inaction that motivated Arizona lawmakers to approve the new law creating the crime of smuggling in 2005. Maricopa County District Attorney Andrew Thomas announced he would interpret the law to mean illegals caught with a smuggler could be prosecuted as co-conspirators if they paid a coyote to transport them across the border.  Now, Sinema is targeting border-security groups like the Minutemen with new legislation that would define anyone not formally affiliated with law enforcement, who patrolled in search of illegal activity while armed, as a domestic terrorist. If it becomes law, the bill would impose a mandatory minimum jail sentence, even if prosecutors recommend probation.  HB 2286 reads:  Sec. 2. Title 13, chapter 23, Arizona Revised Statutes, is amended by adding section 13-2320, to read:  13-2320. Domestic terrorism; classification  A. An individual or group of individuals commits domestic terrorism if the individual or group of individuals are not affiliated with a local, state or federal law enforcement entity and associate with another individual or group of individuals as an organization, group, corporation or company for the purpose of patrolling to detect alleged illegal activity or to individually patrol for the purpose of detecting alleged illegal activity and if the individual or group of individuals is armed with a firearm or other weapon.  B. Any city, town or county that suffers injury arising out of a violation of this section may maintain an action in superior court for the recovery of damages or for an injunction, or both. The court may award the successful party reasonable attorney fees.  C. If the court sentences the defendant to a term of probation, the court shall order that as an initial condition of probation the defendant be imprisoned in the county jail for a period of not less than six months. This jail term of incarceration shall not be deferred, deleted or otherwise suspended and shall commence on the date of sentencing. This subsection does not apply to persons who are sentenced to serve a period of incarceration in the state department of corrections.  D. A violation of this section is a class 5 felony.  Sinema and other Democrat legislators joined the ACLU and the American Friends Service Committee as legal observers during the Minutemen's project on the Arizona-Mexico border in April 2005.  "I've been monitoring the Minutemen for a year now," Sinema told vigilantewatch. org at the time, "and they're just scary." _________________	mysteryman	criminalize	 false

The Minutemen	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6852616	Thomas, I don't like the concept of self-imposed minuteman patrolling our borders, and having seen some of their leaders (locally) here on TV and having read that one or two of them have allegedly ties to white supremacists, makes it all the more disturbing. The law cannot define resp. test whose a fanatic or not, allowing such minuteman formation should be prohibited altogether for that matter.  On page 2 I've quoted a newspaper clip from last year where 2 illegal aliens were shot in an area patrolled by minutemen. The illegals weren't robbed of anything, which made an accusation of murderous bandits quite unbelievable. The direct involvement of minutemen could not be proven, however. Everyone draws their own conclusions.  Last year before many migrant camps were closed, the police was on a daily basis called to the migrant camps in a town called Vista which is north of San Diego and heavily populated by Hispanics. Local TV crews and papers have reported extensively about the altercations between so called minutemen and day-laborers.  Do I think this is domestic terrorism? No, it is pure harassment of a minority group that has no way of defending themselves publicly.	CalamityJane	could	 false

The Minutemen	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192783-6852616	Re: Dem wants to make the minutemen "terrorists"  <quote orig_author="mysteryman"> HB 2286 reads:  Sec. 2. Title 13, chapter 23, Arizona Revised Statutes, is amended by adding section 13-2320, to read:  13-2320. Domestic terrorism; classification  A. An individual or group of individuals commits domestic terrorism if the individual or group of individuals are not affiliated with a local, state or federal law enforcement entity and associate with another individual or group of individuals as an organization, group, corporation or company for the purpose of patrolling to detect alleged illegal activity or to individually patrol for the purpose of detecting alleged illegal activity and if the individual or group of individuals is armed with a firearm or other weapon. </quote>  OK, first:  I dont like the Minutemen none. I dont agree with what they stand for, with their tactics, nor their rhetorics.  And I'd be very, very wary indeed about groups of volunteers scouring around the neighbourhood to uncover crimes, wearing weapons. It would certainly be forbidden in Holland, in Hungary too, and I'm glad. That said:  This notion of legally defining people as "terrorists" when they have neither executed nor planned any terrorist attack is at least as scary to me. "Domestic terrorists" - that should be about McVeigh and political assassins, not about some bozos posturing as would-be cops.  Unlike in Holland, you do have the right to bear arms. Depending on where you're from, people carry guns regularly enough. So if you have a neighbourhood watch group, for example, the same as you would have over here, in Bumfuck Texas, the same guys would be carrying guns, yeah. Not a particularly comfortable thought, but considering that neighbourhood watch groups are often a good thing, and people are by rule allowed to carry guns, it seems odd to suddenly outlaw neighbourhood watch groups from carrying guns - let alone define them as "domestic terrorists". Yet that is what this law would do, the way I read it - its phrasing hardly applies to volunteer 'border guards' alone  A minumum sentence of six months jail strikes me as insanely disproportionate. On those grounds, I'd oppose the proposal if I had anything to say about it.  Finally, however, I want to ask a question. This is Arizona. The proposal sounds to me like something that has no chance in hell to be passed in that state's legislature. Am I right?  If I'm right, we're talking about some one State House member proposing a bill thats going nowhere. Whence the national interest, the Fox News story? This thread here?	nimh	dont	 false

NAMBLA	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8814876	With the recent defense of queers and their sick lifestyle by MissleMan and Wolvie, all no doubt to the pleasure of our board queer, nakedemporer, quite possibly friends of his he pursuaded to come and join the board for that very reason, I would like to see ANY ONE of them, DEFEND THIS!!! This is your homo world.  <a href="http://www.nambla.de/">http://www.nambla.de/</a>  <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/tx/reachme/NAMBLA.html">http://www.angelfire.com/tx/reachme/NAMBLA.html</a>  North American Man/Boy Love Association  On December 17, 1994., I was watching Americas Most Wanted, when they aired a story concerning an organization called North American Man/Boy Love Association or NAMBLA. John Walsh stated That he and the FBI has tried for years to stop NAMBLA, and that all members of NAMBLA are sexually abusing young boys. Stephen Davis Lewis was wanted for child sexual abuse and Leyland Stevenson who has been in prison for child pornography, said in his interview, that he and all the members have sex with young boys; they go to the park, library, and such, to pick up young boys for sex and there is nothing wrong with it.  I called NAMBLAs phone number in New York City and a recorded message said If you want information about NAMBLA send a stamped self addressed envelope to PO Box 174, NY, NY 10018. I sent the request and received a pamphlet concerning NAMBLA and a membership form. In order to stop NAMBLA we needed to gather information on them. I sent a $25.00 American Express money order and became a member using an alias.  NAMBLA was featured on Americas Most Wanted again, this time they arrested Stephen Davis Lewis, he was with a 15 year old boy.  I received my membership package. It contained a NAMBLA Bulletin with hand drawings of young nude boys, and stories of men sexually abusing young boys. It also contained a list of reading material anyone can order by sending a check payable to Zymurgy Inc. I called the New York Secretary of State to check on Zymurgy Inc., and was told they were incorporated on September 9, 1994., as a Type B Non Profit Corporation. Which means it was incorporated to foster and advance greater knowledge and understanding of human sexuality through workshops and lectures. A Type B corporation in New York is the same as an IRS 501(c)3. This means that Zymurgy Inc., is granted special privileges including discounted postal rates, sales tax exemptions, and the right to solicit tax-deductible contributions. To sum it up, we (the taxpayers) are providing support to the people who sexually abuse our children. I ordered a copy of the Articles of Incorporation on Zymurgy Inc., for a list of directors and other information. I requested from American Express a copy of the negotiated $25.00 money order and received the copy with NAMBLAs bank account information (Apple Bank for Savings in New York City). I sent a request for the reading material, with an American Express money order, in the amount of $6.50, payable to Zymurgy Inc.  Upon reviewing the Articles of Incorporation it stated that the three directors were; Peter Melzer, an New York Teacher; Robert J Rhodes, an Veteran Administration clerk; and William Andriette, the editor of the NAMBLA Bulletin. All three are verified NAMBLA members, Melzer was suspended because of his membership. With this information I sent a letter to The New York State Department of Education (copy attached), with copies to: the Attorney General, Dennis C Vacco; the Governor, George E Pataki; and the Secretary of State, Alexandra Treadwell. After five weeks of numerous calls, there was no response. On May 30, 1995., I called again and left a message that if I didnt receive a call by the 31st, I would contact the media. On May 31st, I called Mike Gallagher, a reporter with the New York Post and gave him the information. On June 1st, the story appeared in the paper and I received a faxed response from the New York Department of Education (copy attached). It stated they turned this over to the Attorney General to dissolve Zymurgy Inc. Also, there was a press release from the Governors office stating that New York would dissolve Zymurgy Inc. On June 2nd, Assistant Attorney General, Steven Hicks filed a petition to dissolve Zymurgy Inc., in New York State Supreme Court.  The following months I worked with the Assistant Attorney General to gather more information on Zymurgy Inc./NAMBLA. NAMBLA would have to answer to the court as to why Zymurgy Inc., shouldnt be dissolved. They lied on their application for incorporating Zymurgy Inc. If they had told the truth, they would not have been accepted for non profit status.  In July, 1995., as a member of NAMBLA I received a magazine called Gayme. The content page stated Gayme is currently published two times per year by Zymurgy Inc., Press run for this issue: 7000., and All nude models depicted herein are at least 18 years of age That means there are 7,000 copies mailed. They also stated Make checks payable to Zymurgy Inc. for purchase of additional magazines. The Gayme magazine contains 15 front nude photos of boys, and these boys appear to be between the ages of 12 through 16 years. In my opinion their disclaimer was false, therefore I immediately sent a copy to the Assistant Attorney General. When they received it, their opinion was the same. Thus, they filed a Amended Petition to include the Gayme Magazine.  In August, 1995., the judge made his decision to allow Zymurgy Inc., to retain their non profit status. When I received the judges decision I could not believe it. I called Judge Robert D. Lippman, and asked him, How? Just how could you make that decision after seeing the Gayme Magazine? He said, The magazine was not filed in his court. When I contacted the Attorney General, he said that it was filed and he sent me verification. Which indicated to me that the Judge didnt bother to look at the magazine before he made his decision. The Gayme Magazine is an example of Zymurgys Inc., Education in Human Sexuality. The Secretary of State, Dennis Vacco, in his press release stated that New York State would appeal the Judges decision.  I receive another NAMBLA Bulletin in November, 1995. Enclosed with the bulletin was an announcement of NAMBLAs Victory over New York State (copy attached). I faxed this to the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of State. For the next five months the Assistant Attorney General worked on their appeal. In April, 1996., the appeal was filed.  On January 31, 1996., the New York Senate presented a bill, bill #7879, to dissolve Zymurgy Inc. Then on June 24, 1996., the Senate passed the bill and the governor of New York, George E. Pataki, signed the bill into law. This action is extraordinary, a bill just for Zymurgy Inc. I believe Zymurgy Inc.,/NAMBLA celebrated their Victory to soon.  On July 11, 1996., Governor George E Pataki, directed the Secretary of State Alexandra Treadwell, to accept and file a copy of a new law, 7879 (copy attached), as a certificate of dissolution for Zymurgy Inc., forthwith. Zymurgy Inc., is no longer a charity or corporation.  I sent Senator William Larkin, one of the senators who initiated the bill, a copy of the Gayme Magazine, with confidence that child pornography charges will be filed against Peter Melzer, Robert J Rhodes and William Andriette. If we work together we can make a difference, this is proof.  On November 14, 1996, the Attorney General of New York won their appeal against Zymurgy Inc./NAMBLA. The Appellate Court overturned Judge Robert D. Lippmanns decision, and dissolved Zymurgy Inc. Zymurgy Inc. was dissolved twice once by a new law and once by the Appellate Court. Now the Attorney General will do discovery, which will include the accountability of the money that was collected in the name of Zymurgy Inc., and if they find that NAMBLA used any of the charity money from Zymurgy Inc., for NAMBLAs operation then that will constitute charity fraud. I know that the State of New York will prosecute the three main NAMBLA people.  I received the copy of the negotiated American Express money order payable to Zymurgy Inc., the bank is located in Boston, Massachusetts. Now that Zymurgy, Inc., is not a non profit corporation, all their assets will be confiscated by New York State and the Attorney General has a bank account for their audit.

NAMBLA	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8814876	One of the things that puzzles me about this situation is the ACLU's enthusiastic defense of these degenerates. If there was an organization which promoted men having sex with eight to sixteen year old girls, I wonder if the ACLU would come charging in. I used to believe that the ACLU was a worthwhile organization. But over time I have come to realize my mistake. The ACLU is simply a pack of idiot anarchists who will support any cause, no matter how sick or repugnant, if they can obstruct justice in the process.  NAMBLA's motto used to be (is?) "Sex before eight or else it's too late". Apparently the ACLU thinks that falls under the protection of free speech.  It should be legal to shoot every one of these disgusting perverts on sight.

However, none of the gay men I know would support their activities, and find them every bit as abhorent as you or I do. Nor, is NAMBLA about the informed consensual relationships between two adults, that most relationships, gay or straight, are.  To associate all gay men with the perversions of a few is the logical fallacy of guilt by association, your arguments are without merit.  &lt;blockquote&gt;While most pedophiles who engage in or fantasize about same-sex children do not participate in heterosexual adult sexual relations, they also deny being homosexual. Instead, the pedophiles are more sexually aroused by male and female children than by either gender of adults. &lt;/blockquote&gt;  Source: &lt;a href=http://www.umkc.edu/sites/hsw/issues/pedophil.html&gt;The Human Sexuality WEB&lt;/a&gt;  So, you see, to associate gay men with pedophiles is not only fallacious, it is also misguided.

I mean, when was this last really successfully done. The whole 'ending immigration' is quite a new thing with respect to the state of humanity over millenia. In the past it was more than possible for people to migrate and settle elsewhere. Think of the Irish in America, think of the Aryans in India, think of the Arabs in Persia etc. It's arguably absurd to permanently restrict people's movement.  I think 'forced deportation' would be very difficult to accomplish as well. I mean, for starters who would you choose to deport. Every migrant? What about descendants of migrants who were born in Britain who had earned their citizenship. What about those migrants who had paid far more in tax than their British counterparts? What about those who were legally married to somebody of British ethnicity. What about their children who would be of mixed ethnicity - (e.g. half-English, half-Polish). And how would religion come into this - would Catholics be deported? Which would matter more - religion or ethnicity? Would an ethnical.y British Sunni Muslim be deported in favour of an ethnically Persian Protestant? Would Europeans be allowed to stay (remember the EU treaty and freedom of movement). Which kind of Europeans? Western? Eastern? Both? Neither?  Don't you think there would be severe resistance to the 'forced deportation' policy. What if the people you intend to target resist? Don't you think that a sizeable proportion of the ethnically British population would fight alongside them? What if some resorted to crippling attacks like suicide bombing? How would you propose to capture London - 40% of the people there are migrants. If there is no alternative to your 'forced deportation' don't you think many people who may be going back to a warzone/poverty may consider fighting to the death - better to die in European prosperity than live in abject poverty in the developing world.  Even in the highly unlikely event that the BNP manage to create their 'Fortress Britain' what would happen to trade? What if various embargos were imposed? What about sanctions? What about the brain-drain? Many of the most intellectually capable people in Britain are of foreign descent. Would you allow British people to leave (voluntarily?). What if Britain becomes a pariah-state. What if all other nations block entry of any 'Britons'. What if a coalition decides to take military action and there is an invasion. Also consider your ageing population. What about when younger people are necessary to keep the economy aloof? Etc, etc.	xps.systems	ethnicity	 false

I do think it's quite radical for a British person to oppose multiculturalism, incidentally. Yet that's just because I think it's quite radical to care about someone elses' race. Granted, I've heard your arguments for why you think it is rational to care about someone's race; so I guess it's a matter of personal preference. However personal preference can be accomodated within a multiculturalist society. Nobody forces anyone else to associate with another race inside your own property, yet multiculturalism allows British people to have the opportunity to do precisely that if they so wish.  And given the history of the BNP, I think it's understandable that they're seen as quite an extremist party - their protests, their "power by the boot" slogan they used to adopt, their previous policies (incidentally, it's no surprise that most people who deny the Holocaust, as Griffin did, often come with some political baggage...) They've changed their PR, but I think the same BS still lurks deep down inside the majority of their fan base.	Melancholy	shores	 false

Spend their lives enslaved to alcohol? Surely they must have aspirations. They are so lucky that their native tongue is a universal language - which is useful in most countries on the planet. What if your native tongue is something like Swahili? And then you have to learn English/Mandarin if you want to get anywhere globally? How do such people go about being bilingual? You have an education system in the UK which makes it compulsory for children to attain qualifications until the age of 16 - I don't think this is the case in many developing countries - can't you see how good you have it? Nearly 100% of people in the UK are literate - again unlike in many developing countries. I think these people need to take a long hard look at their culture and realize that it is THEM who need to do something about it and that it is NOT the fault of immigrants that it is they way it is. How on earth is it possible to "steal" a job as well? Possibly the immigrant was selected for the position over the native since that person was more suited to the job specification. I'm sure there are times when a native gets selected over an immigrant - again most probably because the native applicant had a more appropriate skillset for the job. Jobs aren't "stolen" - and it is very arrogant to think that!

But then when has science been consulted by people who have agendas, except to manipulate it to your own ends. I suggest you read something that isn't propaganda by the Right wing.  The human races diversity is so minor that the term race for humanity is meaningless. Scientists tend to look at gradations according to geography as populations become more widespread historically or further apart geographically now. No species in the animal kingdom that shared 99.5% of each others DNA would ever be delineated at all, even into sub groups, let alone split into separate categories. Such a distinction is purely historical and is based on ignorance not scientific methodology.  The gene differences between Europeans are even less significant and barely worthy of note except in a historical/anthropological note, to see where we came from and where we spread to.  The genetic differences between a single population are more pronounced than those between other "races".  Encyclopaedia Britannica  <quote> "[T]he idea that the human species is divided into distinct groups on the basis of inherited physical and behavioral differences. Genetic studies in the late 20th century denied the existence of biogenetically distinct races, and scholars now argue that “races” are cultural interventions reflecting specific attitudes and beliefs that were imposed on different populations in the wake of western European conquests beginning in the 15th century."  "The modern meaning of the term race with reference to humans began to emerge in the 17th century. Since then it has had a variety of meanings in the languages of the Western world. What most definitions have in common is an attempt to categorize peoples primarily by their physical differences. In the United States, for example, the term race generally refers to a group of people who have in common some visible physical traits, such as skin colour, hair texture, facial features, and eye formation. Such distinctive features are associated with large, geographically separated populations, and these continental aggregates are also designated as races, as the “African race,” the “European race,” and the “Asian race.” (Some experts suggest there are five or more geographic races.) Many people think of race as reflective of any visible physical (phenotypic) variations among human groups, regardless of the cultural context and even in the absence of fixed racial categories."  "Although most people continue to think of races as physically distinct populations, scientific advances in the 20th century demonstrated that human physical variations do not fit a “racial” model. There are no genes that can identify distinct groups that accord with the conventional race categories. DNA analyses have proved that all humans have much more in common, genetically, than they have differences." </quote>  Wiki: race and genetics	JMonkey	species	 false

Couldn't people just hide? Also how do you propose to physically remove approximately 5 million ethnically non-British people? Especially in London. What about all those ethnically British people who support the fact that they live alongside foreigners - or at least those who are prepared to fight alongside them in the event of the BNP/NF ever attempting to carry out such a procedure. What are you going to do about mixed race children? And are you forcibly going to break up married couples where both partners are from different ethnic groups? What are you going to do about non-Protestant places of worship? What jobs do you propose that any remaining immigrants will do? Will it be OK for a couple where both partners are of different ethnicities to have sex? Will they be sterilized to prevent them from reproducing? I fail to understand why it would be the state's business to interfere in those private lives. Will it be OK for migrants who have never claimed benefit (and don't intend to do so) to stay? How would you classify white and non-white. What about people from areas such as Andalusia, Italy and Eastern Europe, where their ancestry is often a mixture of indigenous Europeans and Moorish/Berber/Hunnic/Mongoloid/Iranian nomads/invaders. Will there be some form of genetic test that will need to be undertaken to prove 'whiteness'? What criteria are going to be used? Can somebody appeal against the result?

It is clear, and has been for some time, that the BNP is overwhelmingly benefiting from disenchanted Labour voters, voting for the Right (Con) is tribally frowned upon so is not even given an educated thought and they do not trust nor understand the Libs. It is an uncomfortable truth for Labour ministers and MPs to accept but their voters set of beliefs and attitudes are actually rather distant from themselves and they have engenered within their own tenure an uncomfortable swing to nationalism as a direct response to their policies.  Without being facetious or anything, Labour is a two-term party, three terms and one finds economic downturns and increased intolerance/community/social problems, thus the topic of this thread.

Also, overwhelming numbers of British people uneqivocally support the UK armed forces and feel Labour has let them down (plus the wars), support for monarchy/old institutions is also rather indelible, and the upper working classes find it insulting when Labour perhaps try to rewrite a nation's history in a matter of years.

OK, there is one sense in which the term might be legitimate: take Jade Goody for example, a lot of people who do not inspect phenotype too closely might think that she is of fully British descent, but in fact she is ~1/4 negroid, i.e. well outside even the European genetic region. A 1/8 negroid will tend to be somewhat hard to distinguish in the majority of cases. So, you have people who can pass for British/European but are not British/European in genetic terms. In this case, it might be fair to say that racial purity has diminished, although perhaps the term is still inadvisable given its non-scientific connotations.  What I am concerned about is not 'racial purity' though, it is reproductive success, a necessary condition of which is that we do not permit massive non-reciprocal immigration into Britain, or into Europe. Clearly this population movement is occurring; Britons and Europeans in general are being racially replaced. This is not generic race mixing, which I would not necessarily oppose, but replacement.  </quote>  No they are not.  <quote> As for why I am concerned about reproduction: it seems that this is an internal motivation, like parental or brotherly love for example.

Biodiversity Research Centre, Université catholique de Louvain, Place Croix du Sud 5, 1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. <a href="mailto:sofie.vandewoestijne@uclouvain.be">sofie.vandewoestijne@uclouvain.b e</a>  BACKGROUND: Theory predicts that lower dispersal, and associated gene flow, leads to decreased genetic diversity in small isolated populations, which generates adverse consequences for fitness, and subsequently for demography. Here we report for the first time this effect in a well-connected natural butterfly metapopulation with high population densities at the edge of its distribution range. RESULTS: We demonstrate that: (1) lower genetic diversity was coupled to a sharp decrease in adult lifetime expectancy, a key component of individual fitness; (2) genetic diversity was positively correlated to the number of dispersing individuals (indicative of landscape functional connectivity) and adult population size; (3) parameters inferred from capture-recapture procedures (population size and dispersal events between patches) correlated much better with genetic diversity than estimates usually used as surrogates for population size (patch area and descriptors of habitat quality) and dispersal (structural connectivity index). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that dispersal is a very important factor maintaining genetic diversity. Even at a very local spatial scale in a metapopulation consisting of large high-density populations interconnected by considerable dispersal rates, genetic diversity can be decreased and directly affect the fitness of individuals. From a biodiversity conservation perspective, this study clearly shows the benefits of both in-depth demographic and genetic analyses. Accordingly, to ensure the long-term survival of populations, conservation actions should not be blindly based on patch area and structural isolation. This result may be especially pertinent for species at their range margins, particularly in this era of rapid environmental change. </quote>  General principal of evolution.  That was after five minutes. But I think Pavlik needs a basic lesson in evolutionary biology. Isolated population &lt; diverse population with exchange of genetic material between populations. In diverse population successful mutations are more likely to occur where there is a mix of genetic material. The only process for genetic diversity to occur in isolated populations is genetic drift, a slower and less genetically vigorous method for promoting beneficial mutations in a species, this can lead to gain of advantages, but because of the isolation it also means advantages can be lost. Also the lack of diverse genetic material means mutation and diversity are less likely, speciation may occur but the population will tend to become increasingly specialised and if exposed to conditions such as disease and or environmental changes may be less able to adapt.  I'm pretty sure that no reputable scientist claims isolation is better for species fitness than exchange of genetic material between populations either. It would tend to make evolution false. Anyway lets sum up evolution for the beginner. Evolution is the survival of those most able to adapt. Of prime importance to this is diversity of population and to some extent size of population, which means more genetic traits are developed, leading to it being less likely they will be lost due to genetic drift. Which basically means population interbreeding promotes evolutionary viability. Now you might think that this does not apply to humans, but traits such as lactose tolerance, malaria resistance, plague resistance, smallpox resistance, are more efficiently passed on in terms of diversity through the species by interbreeding between populations and cultures, not by isolation. This is just basic genetics.  Oh and by the way replacement migration is not what happens in European populations. What happens is cultural integration over time, English people aren't being sent to death camps. That's more the racialist style. Start off with a hypothesis that does not reflect population mechanics and then claim something happens that is detrimental. I'm not impressed but then I suspect the paper has been manipulated to support something else? AS usual the science is apt enough but the proviso is entirely specious when applied to the UK.  <quote> Which modern events affect ethnic genetic interests? This interest is ultimately a matter of population size, which can be directly reduced through warfare, genocide, and the loss of limiting resources such as territory. The fact that a 30 percent loss of population is a 30 percent loss of ethnic genetic interest is obvious. But competition can have powerful effects without any behavior that is aggressive in the usual sense of the word. The prime example in the contemporary world is peaceful migration between states and high rates of reproduction by one ethnic group within multi-ethnic states. Like the bands and tribes in which humans evolved, states are territorially based and act to police their borders. The special quality of a defended territory is that it insulates a population from the vicissitudes of demographic disturbances in the metapopulation, namely the connected phenomena of uneven population growth and migration. When an ethny controls the borders of a territory that is large enough to support the population, loss of fitness relative to other ethnies is not necessarily fatal; it need not lead to replacement. A decimated, defeated, or impoverished population can quickly recover if it retains control of its territory, but a large-scale influx of genetically distant immigrants has the potential permanently to reduce the genetic interests of the original population. Territory adequately defended guarantees continuity and the chance to ride out a temporary downturn in numbers relative to other populations. </quote>  30% population loss? Er wut? Large scale influx? Er nope.  This reminds me of the usual smoke and mirrors tactic of the BNP. If you want to know what science thinks try studying the field, not reading propaganda from anti immigration/far right web sites. Nice to see the far right is willing to up its game according to the education of the subject though. It's still bs but it's bs with citations, instead of just bs generally foisted off on the average BNP voting mushroom.  Anybody know any genetic biologists on this site?

Very interesting. But the point is that the ancient Britons were a northern European tribe who were invaded for the best part by other northern European tribes. These tribes all melded together over the course of several hundred years and resulted in what we today call "the British" That process essentially ended 1000 years ago with the last major invasion from Europe; that of the Normans.  But, after a 1000 years, the British now face a new invasion of people who are definately not of European stock and many of whom do not share the cultural and social norms of the host nation. That's what concerns so many people.	Howard	face	 false

I've traced my ancestry and it turns out I'm descended from German Jews, English (presumably Anglo-Saxon), Scottish and French.  I highly doubt many other people within the United Kingdom are 'pure' Britain, and if you think otherwise you'll be deluding yourself. In my opinion as long as the laws of this land are respected I couldn't give a damn about the races that live here, and besides, it's proven that breeding with less similar genotypes is beneficial to descendants, so any interracial breeding can only be a good thing as far as the human race is concerned.	halbeth	pure	 false

Perhaps, but they will hardly pose a major threat. The point is, if we make strong efforts to prevent any permanent settlement, and because they generally stand out from indigenous Britons, they will have great difficulty in executing anything. Eyes will be on them at all times.  Of course I see them, they are always around. But passing as European in general and passing as British are two different things. You put a bunch of Turks together though and they have trouble passing as any Europeans, let alone Britons.  There are not many Muslims who have a history of living in Britain at all, excepting Albanians and some Russians, who do not really pose us a threat like Middle Easterners, Pakistanis etc. do (and we are not going to allow them into Britain anyway).  The IRA are indistinguishable from us though. And they live next to us.  But yes, maybe they could pull off the odd thing somehow. But terrorism would cease to be any kind of major problem. If you think we are incapable of stopping the vast majority of any immigration (particularly of people who do not look like us) and periodically ejecting those who made it through the first stage, you are wrong.  It is quite possible to ensure that the vast majority of temporary visitors are just that, especially bearing mind that the public in a BNP Britain would not have the same ideological make-up as today (i.e. they would be vigilant).  </quote>  I genuinely can't believe how naive you are.  Do you really think that we can stop terror at the doorstep. And not only that many of the terrorists weren't even Pakistani. This is shockingly unreflective lunacy to believe terrorism can be made to respect borders, when it has never done so in history. Yeah of course MI5 have a special paki detector, or cypriate detector or Saudi detector, that sniffs out Muslim genes and can track them down to a location anywhere in the UK, no matter how they enter legally or by boat from Norway.  Honestly its a nice slant on the we are threatened and will be less threatened honest under the BNP, but its garbage. You can't inhibit legitimate business and diplomatic movement into a country without destroying trade. And terrorists can quite happily pose as either diplomats or businessmen. The Iranians have had a history of using either or both as do Al Qaeda although mostly through business contacts. Believe it or not some of the most dangerous terrorists in terrorist organisations have set foot on English shores with or without legal entry, and they will continue to do so, with or without permission from The Queen.

Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6756105	ELDORADO, Texas - Sect leaders at a polygamist compound in West Texas refused Saturday to let authorities search a temple for a teenage girl whose report of abuse led to the raid, and authorities said they were preparing "for the worst."  If no agreement is reached with sect leaders, authorities will forcibly remove the sect's followers "as peaceably as possible," Allison Palmer, a prosecutor in Tom Green County, told the San Angelo Standard-Times.  Medical workers are being sent "in case this were to a go in a way that no one wants," Palmer said. Law enforcers are "preparing for the worst," she said.  "Within the religion that we have encountered, their place of worship is very special to them," Palmer said. "It appears to be of great concern to them if a person from outside their congregation even attempts to step inside their place of worship."  A search warrant authorized troopers to enter the retreat, run by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. They are looking for evidence of a marriage between the girl and a 50-year-old man.  Court documents the girl had a baby eight months ago, when she was 15.  State welfare officials on Friday removed 52 girls from the compound. Marleigh Meisner, a spokeswoman for Child Protective Services, said another 131 residents were removed overnight. By Saturday afternoon, 137 children and 46 women were being housed and interviewed at local community centers.  "They seem to be doing fine," Meisner told The Associated Press. Investigators remained inside the compound looking for additional children, she said.  The whereabouts of the 16-year-old mother who sparked the investigation are unknown, Meisner said. State troopers who raided the religious retreat were looking for the girl, her baby girl and 50-year-old Dale Barlow.  Under Texas law, girls younger than 16 cannot marry, even with parental approval.  Officials in Texas declined to comment Saturday on whether they had found Barlow, citing a gag order, but the man's probation officer told The Salt Lake Tribune that he was in Arizona.  "He said the authorities had called him (in Colorado City, Ariz.) and some girl had accused him of assaulting her and he didn't even know who she was," said Bill Loader, a probation officer in Arizona.  Barlow was sentenced to jail time last year after pleading no contest to conspiracy to commit sexual conduct with a minor. He was also ordered to register as a sex offender for three years while he is on probation.  His lawyer in that case, Bruce Griffen, said he had not spoken to Barlow in a year.  The search warrant instructed officers to look for marriage records or other evidence linking her to the man and the baby. The warrant authorized the seizure of computer drives, CDs, DVDs or photos.  Those inside the retreat did not respond to requests for comment.  The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints broke away from the Mormon church after the latter disavowed polygamy more than a century ago.  The compound sits down a narrow paved road and behind a hill that shields it almost entirely from view in town. Only the 80-foot-high, gleaming white temple can be seen on the horizon. Authorities blocked access to the gate, keeping onlookers miles away.  The 1,700-acre property had been an exotic game ranch. It is surrounded by dusty, wind-swept land where sheep are raised and mohair produced.  Eldorado (pronounced el-dor-AY'-do) is a two-stoplight town of fewer than 2,000 people and located nearly 200 miles northwest of San Antonio. It consists of a cluster of government buildings, a couple churches and a few blocks of houses.  State officials said they did not know how many people lived at the retreat, although local officials estimated about 150 two years ago.  The FLDS has been led by Warren Jeffs since his father died in 2002. In November, Jeffs was sentenced to two consecutive sentences of five years to life in prison in Utah for being an accomplice to the rape of a 14-year-old girl who wed her cousin in an arranged marriage in 2001.  In Arizona, Jeffs is charged as an accomplice with four counts each of incest and sexual conduct with a minor stemming from two arranged marriages between teenage girls and their older male relatives. He is jailed in Kingman, Ariz., awaiting trial.	edgarblythe	broke	 false

Overall, Texas has the 5th highest pregnancy rate for minors in the country at 62 per 1000.  Extrapolating that out, the compound is running at a rate of 25 per 1000 - less than half of the state rate.  Now, I'm not saying that someone shouldn't be asking if these girls are being abused but if this is the sort of evidence the state is using to justify everything going on then there are going to be some huge issues very quickly here. </quote>  The issue for the compound is minor girls impregnated by ADULT males. Doesn't the pregnancy rate for minors in Texas overall involve UNDERAGE males? </quote>  From what I've been reading the State of Texas has NO IDEA who impregnated them and they had no idea how many were pregnant when they began the raid. (There has been discussion about running DNA tests on every member from the compound to try to sort out some of that.)  They are justifiying their "suspicion" on the fact that 5 of the 200 girls were pregnant. If that (in itself) is adequate cause for suspicion that the girls were impregnated by adults then they'd better lock down the rest of the state and get busy testing.  The question I am raising is "Did they have justification for the raid when they went in or did they conduct the raid to find evidence to create "after the fact" justifation?".  The longer this is going on, the longer it is looking like the latter is true.	fishin	true	 false

I think we need to seperate things here a bit. There is a difference between seperating a child and their parents for an interview (or even multiple interviews) and seperating them for weeks/months at a time while teh entire investigation runs through it's process. We aren't talking about an afternoon interview here. The latter is what I was speaking to.  The stats I can find here for the State of MA show 46% of all initial complaints are screened out in any given year. The remaining 54% are considered to warrant investigation. Of those, less than 10% result in the child being removed from the home during the investigation.	fishin	speaking	 false

Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6756105	[CODE]SAN ANGELO, Texas - The state of Texas made a damning accusation when it rounded up 462 children at a polygamous sect's ranch: The adults are forcing teenage girls into marriage and sex, creating a culture so poisonous that none should be allowed to keep their children.  .  Rod Parker, a spokesman for the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, contends that the state has essentially said, "If you're a member of this religious group, then you're not allowed to have children."  Attorneys for the families and civil-liberties groups also are crying foul. They say the state should not have taken children away from all church members living at the Yearning For Zion Ranch in Eldorado.  Church members said that not all of them practice polygamy, and some form traditional nuclear families. One sect member whose teenage son is now in foster care testified that she is a divorced single mother.  "Of course, we condemn child abuse and we don't stand up for the perpetration of that," said Lisa Graybill, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas. But "what the state has done has offended a pretty wide swath of the American people with what appears to be an overreaching action to sweep up all these children. "	hawkeye10	spokesman	 false

In addition, caseworkers assess critical areas of individual and family functioning to determine whether any child in the referred family is at risk of abuse or neglect; and initiate protective services for children who need protection.  To determine whether any child in the family has been abused or neglected and is still at risk of abuse or neglect, the investigative worker may interview family members and appropriate collateral sources. At the end of the investigation, staff must assign a disposition to each allegation identified for the investigation. Dispositions include the following:  Reason-to-believe. Based on a preponderance of the evidence, staff conclude that abuse or neglect has occurred. Ruled-out. Staff determines, based on available information, that it is reasonable to conclude that the abuse or neglect has not occurred. Unable To Complete. An "unable to complete" investigation is one that cannot be concluded and assigned another disposition because the family could not be located to begin the investigation, or the family was contacted but subsequently moved and could not be located to complete the investigation or the family refused to cooperate with the investigation. CPS policy outlines several required actions the caseworker needs to complete with the "Unable To Complete" disposition. Unable-to-determine. Staff concludes that none of the dispositions specified in [1 through 3 above] is appropriate. Administrative closure. Information received after a case was assigned for investigation reveals that continued Child Protective Services intervention is unwarranted. The worker must also determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that a child will be abused or neglected in the foreseeable future. There are two alternatives.  The worker concludes that the children are not at risk if (a) no significant risk factors have been identified, and abuse or neglect has not been found to have occurred in the current investigation; or  (b) the family appears willing and able, through use of family and community resources, to deal with risk factors in their lives in such a manner as to ensure the safety of the child(ren) for the foreseeable future. If the worker concludes that the children are not at risk, then the case may be closed.  The worker concludes that the children are at risk of abuse or neglect if: (a) the worker has identified significant risk factors, and  (b) the family appears unable or unwilling to utilize family and community resources to deal with the risk factors in a manner that will ensure the safety of the child(ren) for the foreseeable future.  If the worker concludes that the children are at risk of abuse or neglect, then the worker may recommend:  services to address the problem, open the case for family based safety services or file a petition to initiate civil court action to protect the victim.

Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-199-192823-6756105	Polygamist sect gets millions from U.S. government By Jack Douglas Jr., staff writer with the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram. Posted on Saturday, April 12, 2008  FT. WORTH, Tex. _American taxpayers have unwittingly helped finance a polygamist sect that is now the focus of a massive child abuse investigation in West Texas, with a business tied to the group receiving a nearly $1 million loan from the federal government and $1.2 million in military contracts.  The ability of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or FLDS, to operate and grow is largely dependent on huge contributions from its members and revenue from the businesses they control, according to a former accountant for the church, and government officials in Utah and Arizona, where the sect is primarily based.  One of those businesses, NewEra Manufacturing in Las Vegas, has been awarded more than $1.2 million in federal government contracts, with most of the money coming in recent years from the Defense Department for wheel and brake components for military aircraft.  A large portion of the awards were preferential no-bid or "sole source" contracts because of the company's classification as a small business, according to online databases that track federal government appropriations.  NewEra, previously known as Western Precision Inc. and located in Hildale, Utah, also received a $900,000 loan in 2005 from the federal Small Business Administration, the data show.  The president and chief executive of the company is John. C. Wayman, identified as an FLDS leader and a close associate to Warren Jeffs, the sect's "prophet," who was convicted last year as an accomplice to rape for arranging the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin.  When Jeffs, who was one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, was arrested in the summer of 2006, he was driving Wayman's late-model red Cadillac Escalade, government officials say.  Wayman did not return phone calls seeking comment.  On NewEra's Web site Wayman says the company is "an honorable and valuable asset to our country" in helping build military and commercial airplanes that carry people throughout the world. He does not mention its ties to the FLDS.  Steve Barlow, human resources manager for NewEra, said last week that it would be inappropriate to comment, "Given everything that's going on. I could only give you the company motto: 'Good parts on time.'. "  U.S. Rep. Kay Granger, the Fort Worth Republican who sits on the House Appropriations Committee that deals with issues of defense, military and homeland security, said she is surprised that the federal government is doing business with a group accused of mistreating women and children.  "It makes me very uneasy," Granger said. "It needs to be investigated without a doubt."  To begin with, she added, federal authorities should look into NewEra's financial records.  John Nielsen, who worked for the company when it was Western Precision in Hildale, said in a 2005 affidavit that he and other FLDS members were made to work for little or no wages, even as the company was bringing in lucrative government contracts and other work.  At the same time, $50,000 to $100,000 in company profits were going each month to FLDS "and/or" Jeffs, Nielsen said in the affidavit, filed as part of a civil lawsuit.  He said he and other sect members thought their working for free or for extremely low wages would bring them redemption. Instead, Nielsen said in the affidavit, he was found to be "wanting" by the sect's leadership, ordered off the property and separated from his five young children and his wife. She was "reassigned" to another man, becoming the fourth of his six wives.  "It broke my heart," Nielsen said in the affidavit. He declined to comment when reached by phone Friday.  In Texas, authorities raided the FLDS' sprawling YFZ Ranch near Eldorado on April 3, beginning an exhaustive search of its 1,691 acres. Authorities were acting on a tip from a 16-year-old girl inside the compound who said she had been beaten and raped by a 50-year-old man whom she was forced to marry.  Since then, a state district court judge has ordered the removal of 416 children, many of them young girls who have children or are pregnant after forced encounters with their "spiritual" husbands in the sect's towering white limestone temple, officials say.  "There's a lot of bad shit in there," said a high-ranking official with the federal Justice Department who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case. On Tuesday, the Justice Department executed a sealed FBI search warrant at the ranch.  While the men of the sect have held close rein on their "plural wives" and children, seldom allowing them to associate with the outside world, the male leaders have fanned out into successful public business ventures. They work as government defense contractors, dairy farmers, engineers, construction contractors, log-cabin homebuilders and suppliers of lanyards, the cords used on eyeglasses or nametags.  In addition, JNJ Engineering, a company owned and operated by FLDS leaders, has made millions of dollars in Las Vegas, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported in September. The company won $11.3 million in contract work from the Las Vegas Valley Water District; all but one of the project workers came from the twin towns of Hildale and Colorado City, Ariz., where most of the sect's 10,000 members live.  Jethro Barlow, a former accountant for the FLDS whom Warren Jeffs excommunicated in 2003, said Jeffs ordered sect members, their families and the companies they operated to "give till it hurts....  "And people did."  Jeffs was able to rally church members to tithe heavily, even if it hurt them financially, because he had convinced them that they had to prepare for the end of the world, Barlow said.  The fever-pitched preparation continued, even after several apocalyptic deadlines had passed. It motivated the rapid construction of the temple at the YFZ Ranch and the erection there of manufactured cabin-like homes made by sect members in Canada, he said.  Barlow, who remains in Hildale, said he believes he and his family were kicked out of the FLDS because they were not among the favored ones in Jeffs' flock.  Although Jeffs is now behind bars, sect members still consider him their leader and prophet, said Bruce Wisan, a nonmember appointed by the state of Utah to replace Jeffs as manager of a the FLDS' trust. Established in 1942 to "preserve and advance the religious doctrines" of the church, it is now estimated to be worth between $100 million and $150 million.  Under Jeffs' direction, Wisan said, sect households are required to tithe at least 10 percent of their gross income to the church, plus an extra $1,000 a month.  Tim Bodily, an assistant attorney over the tax division of the Utah attorney general's office, said Wisan has received little cooperation from those within the sect, which has traditionally shown distrust for outsiders.  "He's been provided no records at all, and no one inside the organization has provided any inside knowledge.... It's a very difficult thing to do," Bodily said. "Progress moves slow when dealing with these people. Texas has its hands full."	BumbleBeeBoogie	search	 false

I think that so long as a child claims to be church married to an adult that the state can not successfully go after the adult for crimes. The law is too weak. Texas very well might try, but I doubt it. They are going to very quickly run up against the conservatives, who will see such laws as an over reaching by the state into the sanctity of marriage, which they view as a religious institution. There will in short order be a polical price to play for using such laws against the cult, because those on the right know that any law used against the cult members are laws that can be used by the state against others.	hawkeye10	long	 false

Also, most FLDS members are still Utah and Arizona, they did not all go to Texas to escape prosecution or for any other reason.  It is also wrong to paint the FLDS as "his followers". Warren Jeffs has for several years been a controversial figure even with-in the FLDS. Jeff's did intend for YFZ to be the model FLDS community based upon his vision for what the FLDS should be, the families then went to Eldorado were picked by him in part because they were most willing to follow him in his challenge of societies right to make laws and enforce laws against marriage of girls under the age of Majority. There is no doubt that Texas has a right to enforce its laws, and the Jeffs and the families he put into YFZ challenged that. However, Texas reacted badly by going into persecution mode. The Jailing of Jeffs on its own would have gone far to getting the YFZ families to stop the marriage practices.

Third District Judge Denise Lindberg granted the increased power to manage the assets of the United Effort Plan (UEP) to Bruce Wisan, who has warned of the possibility of property sales and evictions of residents in Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Ariz., if the trust is unable to cover an upcoming $1.2 million tax bill.  The judge also granted a request made by Wisan and the Utah and Arizona attorneys general to hold off on appointing new trustees to the UEP, an arm of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Lindberg agreed that she needed more information on nominees before deciding who and how many to appoint.  Who will control sect's $100 mil?The two dozen nominees have 20 days to provide more background information, including financial data and statements about why they want to serve as trustees (see box). Interested parties then will have time to file objections or statements of support for candidates.  A hearing is set for Oct. 25, when Lindberg could name three to nine trustees or forgo appointments and leave the trust's management to Wisan.  Lindberg took the matter under advisement after after hearing arguments from lawyers representing various candidates and interested parties. Many alleged that most candidates have a conflict of interest that would affect their work. In a report filed Tuesday, Wisan said most of them are viewed by the FLDS faithful as dissident, apostate or anti-polygamy crusaders.  The nominees range from anti-polygamy activists, including Flora Jessop, to Winston Blackmore, a Canadian formerly associated with the FLDS. One nomination is for the �dream team� of outgoing Dixie State College President Robert Huddleston, certified public accountant Gregory Kemp and physician Craig Booth; their lawyers argued they would provided neutral oversight.  Don Timpson, a nominee who is affiliated with the Centennial Park community near the twin cities, agreed with the judge's decision.  "I think she did exactly what she had to do," he said. "It's a big trust and it's better to do it right."  But Carl Holm Jr., a nominee who left Colorado City years ago, said the disclosure requirements are just a way "to eliminate a lot of people from the board of trustees. I don't know how they figure there are so many qualifications to represent the people down there. Somebody is going to get rich."  Wisan is being paid $205 an hour for his work. His accounting firm and his lawyers also are being paid at their standard rates.  Nearly all the land, homes and buildings in the twin cities are held in the UEP trust set up by the FLDS, which considers plural marriage a central tenet of the faith. About 8,000 followers in the community are considered at-will tenants by the church, which thought of improvements such as new construction and remodels as donations. In the past, the church sought cash donations from members to pay tax bills.  Wisan has valued the Hildale-Colorado City property at $91.6 million. The FLDS also has established outposts in Texas and Colorado.  Wisan was appointed on May 27 to inventory and protect UEP property after Utah and Arizona officials became alarmed by the FLDS' purported attempt to transfer two pieces of property without receiving any compensation for the trust.  Wisan filed suit in May to stop the transfers. His attorney, Jeffrey Shields, said Thursday he is close to finalizing a deal to sell the land, which could bring about $1.5 million to the trust.  Authorities also were alarmed by the failure of UEP trustees and FLDS President Warren Jeffs to defend against three lawsuits, two in state and one in federal court.  The defendants could lose by default, which means the plaintiffs could get damages that would deplete the trust and potentially cost residents their homes.  The trustees, including Jeffs, were stripped of their power in June. Jeffs, who also faces sex charges in Arizona, has not been seen publicly in the past year and a half and his whereabouts are unknown. He is wanted on state and federal warrants and there is a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.  </quote>  <a href="http://www.religionnewsblog.com/11927/judge-expands-power-of-flds-trust-fiduciary">http://www.religionnewsblog.com/11927/judge-expands-power-of-flds-trust-fiduciary</a>  You are so out of the loop that you don't even know that the "church" property is owned by a trust which has been controlled by a judge since 2005.

There will be existing preconceptions formed regardless of the "facts of the case"...which is why I stated that we had insufficient information in the first place.	Saladin	against	 false

I believe it was a terrorist act because of what they did, specifically the mutilation and display of the bodies. Someone being killed on the battlefield is a little bit different. What they did was designed to send a message, which is the point of terrorism.  You can describe these guys as mercenaries if you like, but the fact is they were driving through town as part of a convoy. And I believe the convoy was carrying food (IIRC from Jeremy Skahill's book "Blackwater" where he discussed the ambush in some detail) so it's not exactly like this was 2 opposing forces meeting on the battlefield. They were essentially minding their own business, cruising with the convoy when they were ambushed and murdered.	Amanda	IIRC	 false

London	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810481	This is very much subjective, but which city do you prefer? Both cities I guess are pretty comparable, both roughly the same sized, both of similar world notability and both very diverse.  However, I'd have to say I prefer New York, despite being the same sized, in my opinion New York has a much grander feel about it, modern and historic buildings work really well together, while in many parts of London arcetechture is really **** and imo distracts from the good aspects of London.  Also, on the two occasions I've been to New York, Manhattan feels significatly safer than Central London in terms of getting mugged, beaten up, etc. And even in the rougher parts of New York, if you keep yourself to yourself in the day you're fairly safe, which is more than I can say for some parts of London.	ak56	prefer	 false

London	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810481	NYC has advantages:  Travel : Its the same population on half the space so commuting is cut down significantly.

Tubes run 24hrs, and express trains run much faster with fewer stops, and their tube are more reliable to boot (their map system is damn confusing <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/> though)  Nightlife: Central London closes down far too early, ridiculously early for a hub city. Even with the new licensing laws it's a ghost town past 23:00. The crappy clubs outweigh the good ones in the centre. You have to travel east for a decent nightlife. Even then you struggle for a quiet spot-and you can forget about fresh food.  I easily found a quiet bar open at 2am where I could enjoy a conversation up till 5 am.  Food: NYC has incredible quality cheap food. The Pizzas are cheap and out of this world! The Calzones were utterly indescribable and for that price. insane.  You can order good quality food, at that quiet late night bar you easily found opened. Piping hot, brought to your table, and thoroughly enjoyable and affordable.  A very nice club seated my friend and I where we enjoyed light sea food platters, before hitting the dance floor. The club was amazing, pricey but the same experience in the UK would have been beyond our means as students.  Attitude: Strangers came up and talked to me in bars and clubs.

I was talking to people from around there that some of some family friends know and was warned not to walk around the area at all if possible. Driving around that day I even saw a couple of people roaming around with guns on display (I admit this took me by surprise). Although some of these are small areas, nothing even close to this exists in London so it is not some "mentality".  But I think you do have a point that, as a tourist, your unlikely to see anything like this, and some people may feel safer there than London. The problem is that this is a concerted effort by the city to make it feel safe. It does not mean it is any more safe than London at all, it just feels that way. If London were to make even half that effort (and it would only need to be half the effort after the difference I saw) then it would feel just as safe to these people.  You also have a point about the areas being defined more, but I would rather be a city that happens to have a small criminal element around the place like any normal area would, than one that has a huge effort to keep safe areas but with huge almost no go areas existing. On the streets of London you may have more of a chance to get you pocket picked. On the streets of New York, get lost and you could be in serious trouble.	mabrookes	If	 false

Plus there's too many people, the traffic is awful, and it's too loud. Also, I heard the metro in New York is awful, though I've never been on it before.  London is much nicer. The metro is easy to understand and it's more open, if that makes sense. The tall buildings in NY make it feel like you're in a maze.	fufuakaspeechless	nicer	 false

London	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810481	This is a really tough question and one that I contemplate quite often. I've applied to university both in New York and London, which has prompted me to compare the two quite a deal. In the end, I would say New York is the most amazing city in the world, but London comes right after it. What I love about New York are the skyscrapers, the greed, the constant pace that is so hard to find in London. London is more quaint; it is charming and welcoming. Therefore London is where I'm headed now that I'm 18 and still quite naive. New York's too tough for me right now, I think. It'll be perfect after 3 years in London, though, and besides then I'll be 21 which is ideal for US immigrants. But yeah, I think I'll end up in New York because it's more inspiring.

This is mostly due to the accesibility of housing (you can afford a small apartment in Manhatten on a graduate salary while in London this is very difficult).  Central London also has more geriatrics because it is calmer and easier to live in, while it is common for yuppies to live in Manhatten throughout their 20's/30's then move to connecticut or jersey to start a family.  And in terms of being successful...Manhatten offers more opportunities in pretty much every industry aside from perhaps finance and law where it is tied with London. i am amazed that anyone can afford to live (and have a decent quality of life) in London without earning 40,000+ GBP a year	awm55	there	 false

London	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-200-192446-3810481	**I've edited this one year later, after much personal growth, reflexion, more traveling, experiences, listening to different viewpoints, seeing things in a different way etc. In green underneath. I hope they help someone.  I'm not from London nor NYC. I've lived in London for 4 years and have lived in NYC for 3 months and hands down I prefer London ANYTIME. When I left for NYC from London I was so sure I hated London and couldn't wait to be out of there and was so sure I'd fall in love with NYC...boy was I wrong and the "you never know what you got til it's gone" saying never applied more.  Here's why:  1)Whoever said ppl in NYC are fake was RIGHT. People in London may not be as outgoing, may not walk up to you and talk to you randomly on the streets or be over friendly with you on outings but they are much more down to earth, much more genuine, FRIENDLIER and smile at you in a genuine way and long term relationships are easier!!! In NYC they walk up to you with too much friendliness too soon and then you never hear from them again...I also think NYC is very shallow in that people seem to just talk sex, money, clubbing all the time and nothing else.  I haven't had a single person smile at me during 3 months in NYC but when they do it is FAKE, very fake. The news people in NYC seem very fake. Everything feels very fake.  The cab drivers ARE SO DISRESPECTFUL. Never say hello or thank you.  Ok, one year later I've changed my mind on this. I've realized people in London are actually overly polite and it can be "fake", just to "say it" but not mean it. Americans are more straightforward and don't have to say "sorry, thank you" all the time, doesn't mean they're rude.  About the shallowness of the americans, I have to say americans are MUCH WARMER AND FRIENDLIER. They are more simple and "childlike". I am now prefering this to the Londonders who rationalize too much and lack emotions. Americans have more of a heart and are more generous, hands down.  2) TOO MUCH INDIVIDUALISM in NYC...and too much revolving around money and material things...NYC is much less social meaning people do not sit down and socialize like in London....in London you see people sitting in parcs, cafés etc and talking but in NYC they just sit there and loog good... When I was there all the talking revolves around the oscars, cheezy reality TV and money or how to make it as a star. Seriously...people seem to be so individualistic they lack a certain emotional sensitivity to others and lack interest in others.  I am now seeing this as a good thing. Londoners don't have enough individualism and tend to see everyone "the same", this is really dangerous when you're trying to be different or make something out of yourself, you feel very quickly discouraged. People in america have more faith and a more positive outlook. Granted they have that fake happiness and smile at times, but some of it is not all that fake, I've come to see they really are like that in many ways. They're just more positive. why is this bad? Is the norm being sad and depressed?People in London are just more depressed and seem so sad all the time.  3) Men are very aggressive and women too...the men in London are very polite and do not look at you straight in the eye with the intention to date you. Here in NYC I was aggressed every five minutes with american men asking my number...NO SHAME, they just walk up to you and very very aggressive and direct...they'll immediately start talking about intimacy in rude and lewd terms and if you refuse they insult you !!! The women look at you with JEALOUSY a lot on the streets if you are a pretty girl. Not nice. In London you can feel more girl power and the English girls and foreigner girls who live in London are WAY NICER than the girls in NYC.  I stand by the aggressive thing, HOWEVER I now see I was exxagerating, I think it's a good thing. Londoners don't know how to approach people. Bad thing.  4) NYC as a city is not that green, seems smaller than London...not as much culture or cultural things, everything and I mean absolutely everything revolves around money and celebrities...when you're done with Times Square, central Park, 5th avenue and the likes there's nothing else to see...then it's the same boring thing day in and day out...London is SO HUGE you need a lifetime to explore it all.  So what?  5) The people do not know how to dress, it's a fashion disaster...honestly...its as if everyone is homeless. Girls have less class than in London.  Actually I stand by that fashion is not that good BUT BUT BUT I now see this as a good thing, americans are more down to earth and don't always have to dress up, it's more casual and comfy HOWEVER PEOPLE DRESS BETTER on night outings and going to church and 100% better than those in London  6) SUBWAY IS GROSS AND DIRTY in NYC and so many homeless people in it....10 times more than London !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! London's tube 100% more clean. The people who take subway in NYC seem to be more of the young people with no money whereas thats not the case in London.  Again, the people in subways in america are nicer, there is lively chatting going on all the time, people look at you like a normal human being, if you like privacy a lot not a good thing. In London you do have lively chatting in the evenings when people go clubbing but generally speaking its DEAD and sad. You see people laughing, crying etc, it's more human and less reserved.  7) DIVERSITY sucks in NYC: It's always black, latinos, jews and whites and the rest doesn't count... Its like they know nothing else...sure you got a few chinese, italians and indians in NYC but that's about it and they are not in large numbers...in London ITS AMAZING to have australians, south africans, jews, french, german, indians, latin american people, eastern europeans, canadians asians, NIgerians, somalians, etc etc in LARGE numbers with their own communities, food stores, festivals... and not just 1 or 2...and they each have their own areas...  Ok granted its not their fault but I still hate this.  8) when you go to Times Square on the weekends at night 80% of what you see are young tennagy blacks mostly dressed in Hip Hop Gear...I've never understood why...I once went to the movies in Times Square which would be the equivalent of the Leicester Square Odeon cinema but there were only KIDS in jeans and all black or latinos...  I still stand by that. That was odd.Nothing against black and latinos teenagers but there was only that, so odd, where is the diversity in age and nationality, I was told new yorkers never go to times square but there were not even any tourists there...barely !!!  9) Not enough history in NYC  I see this as positive now, it means ppl are not so stuck in the past  10) Food is not that great to be honest, once you've tried the pizzas and philly cheese steak not much to explore  Well...LOL to that  11) People can be RUDE !!! no manners, THEY STARE AT YOU in the subway, streets....I find London to be BETTER as its more anonymous and people DO NOT STARE AT EACH OTHER  12) Emotionally speaking, I prefer London...people seem more sensitive, human and genuine. In NYC you get a much more "fake" feeling and you always feel like you need to perform and try to be something you're not (its all about money, becoming famous or the best at your job); PEOPLE DO NOT ENJOY LIFE AT ALL....  I don't think this anylonger...  ALL IN ALL....I'll just go to NYC to visit but I could never live there, London is better MUCH MUCH BETTER for genuine relationships, long lasting friendships and for culture and socializing.  I've never liked how everything revolved around money and "making it" in America....they are not laid back and seem to not have any identity apart from STATUS and ACHIEVEMENTS (I'm this and that or try to be this and that or have met such and such...in London ppl talk about their lives and their personalities more)  ANYWAY....be careful with NYC.	happinessmachine	prefer	 false

And you have to remember that people in London may appear more social simply because there is more of a pub culture and people drink much more heavily in the UK.  And with regards to NYC in general, the areas you listed (5'th ave, time square, etc) are dire in my opinion. I am American and much prefer London's touristy areas than NYC's, but to say that Leicester square is nicer or classier is taking it a bit too far <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> NYC in the 20's and below is much nicer and more residential, mid-town is a nightmare at the best of times and I certainly would not want to live there!  And yes, people in NYC are much more career focused and demanding than they are in London, but this is the American attitude and has nothing to do with the city. I have met plenty of people in London who earn 20-30k, live in zone 2 or 3 and are perfectly content in their position. Personally, I find I achieve more when I am surrounded by people who also want to better themselves (whatever that means). I would rather work longer hours, earn more money, and live in zone 1.  People are also more attached to labels in NYC, so your career and education background will pigeonhole you into something that everyone has already established in their minds.  I would also like to know who you were conversing with on a daily basis to only hear conversation about reality television!  And the whole thing about diversity is just crap. America has a much higher black and latino population than Europe does so of course you are going to see more of them. Also, NYC is in a country with 300+ million people while London is in a country with just 60 million. Naturally there are going to be more nationalities in London as you have foreign countries a car drive away, while America only has Canada and Mexico.	awm55	people	 false

You have relatively reliable summers, unlike in London.  2) New Yorkers are more fun and friendly. Londoners are too introverted. Though, having said that, Londoners are more polite. But, of course, politeness does not equal friendliness.  3) New York, or at least much of Manhattan, seems to me to be a more accepting/liberal place than London.  4) There is a vibe/buzz/excitement in New York that you simply do not get in London.  5) The way New York has been designed is so much better than London.

In my experience, in 2010 the roughest parts of New York are no worse than the roughest parts of London, and as in New York there is a more defined destinction between good areas and bad areas, you are safer in New York than you are in London.

I've walked through Brixton at 2 AM on the weekends multiple times and never felt remotely unsafe. The worst thing I saw were people posted up with their pitbull on a leash. I'm sure things happen all the time there, but it wasn't so bad that I couldn't walk through.  In New York, this just isn't the case. You simply cannot walk through neighborhoods like Brownsville, Bed Stuy, East New York, South Jamaica, Queensbridge, Far Rockaway, and most parts of the Bronx at night and pretty much anytime of the day as well. Remember, there are a lot of guns in America and especially in the inner city. Drugs and gangs are a far bigger problem in America than in conservative England. The police in England don't even carry guns and there are far less on the street per capita in London versus NYC. in 2010 there were 135 murders in London. In NYC, there were 532 - you can google this. Other violent crime such as robbery and assault is also far more likely to occur in NYC and at a much higher rate than in London. NYC is just a much wilder place than London because of the Darwinian, Capitalist culture of America and the fact that there is such a high concentration of poverty in a much more overpopulated, dense city. In America, the dollar is king, and everyone is ultra competitive. Everyone is trying to get rich and the poor are killing each other just to survive. Greed is central to crime, and it's just more prevalent on every level in America in general and more so in NYC. Also, most blue collar neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn that have hotels, like LIC, Astoria near the airport etc are actually very safe areas. You can't compare that to walking through the projects at midnight.  NYC is bigger than life, and much of the stuff you see portrayed in movies, actually occurs in the city. London is much more conservative, steeped in tradition and a lot slower paced - in London you don't have 8 lanes of traffic flowing through towering skyscrapers, and sidewalks flooding with people. Don't get me wrong, London is an incredible, world class city, but it just doesn't have the high paced energy, action, and buzz of NYC. The only other developed city that can match NYC in this respect is Tokyo.	FNKYCHLD	neighborhoods	 false

Mexico	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8799924	By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer Wed Sep 12, 10:29 PM ET  WASHINGTON - An 8-year-old boy whose mother was deported to Mexico led a chanting crowd of about 150 pro-immigration activists through the halls of Congress on Wednesday. Capitol Police arrested two demonstrators for disorderly conduct. ADVERTISEMENT  Saul Arellano and other children carried a banner that read: "Born in the USA. Don't take our moms and dads away."  The boy's mother, Elvira Arellano, was deported last month after taking refuge in a Chicago church for a year.  In Tijuana, Mexico, across the border from San Diego, Elvira Arellano spoke about her son to several dozen demonstrators. Saul was scheduled to join her there Thursday.  "He is a boy who has been suffering because the U.S. government told his mother she couldn't stay in their country anymore because she was undocumented," she said.  In Washington, activists clashed with police outside the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, chanting and shouting for her to lead on immigration reform. Saul appeared to get enveloped in the shoving crowd.  Demonstrators taped two oversize letters to Pelosi's door  one in English and one in Spanish  warning her, "If Democrats expect our support in the next election, the Democrats must support us now."  Immigration reform legislation died in Congress this year and isn't expected to be revived anytime soon. Pelosi, D-Calif., was in Oregon on Wednesday for a forum on global warming.  The crowd went to Pelosi's office after a news conference where they prayed, denounced deportations and broke into chants of "Si, se puede!" or "Yes, we can!" Saul drew on a piece of paper and sometimes ducked behind a desk. Asked by a demonstrator whether he wanted to speak, he shook his head no.  The boy, wearing baggy jeans and a striped shirt and looking distracted, then joined other children at the front of an unruly procession through the halls and basements of two House office buildings. Behind him someone carried an icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe and two others held large flags, one Mexican and one Puerto Rican. At one point, a child hesitated to board an escalator, creating a bottleneck.  Protesters left the Cannon House Office Building after police threatened more arrests.  Elvira Arellano was in the U.S. illegally for several years before taking sanctuary at Chicago's Adalberto United Methodist Church, where she lived with her son for a year in defiance of a deportation order.  She left the church last month to speak to other immigrants around the country and was arrested in Los Angeles by immigration authorities. They deported her to Tijuana, where she has been promoting an overhaul to U.S. immigration laws.	Shogun	spoke	 false

Mexico	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8799924	Families have a right to stay together. In this case, if the boy wants to be with his mom, Mexico will welcome him.  In the meanwhile, if the boy and his family think that his staying in the US is more important than his being with his mother, then, that is their choice, also.  Emotional cries for sympathy are always distasteful, as they skew the facts and equate to nothing more than smokescreens.  In this case, the fact that the mother chose to come to this country illegally and then, leave her son here alone, is the most immoral aspect of the story.	Scenic Point	welcome	 false

Mexico	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-170-181122-8799924	nice font!  I think that if the mother and son want to be together then he should either go to Mexico or live real close to the Mexican border. I'm all for the humanitarianism behind allowing immigrants into America. But this boat isn't unsinkable. We must reserve control over who comes in and out. She broke the law by skipping out when her visa expired and had a kid in the US thinking that it would be her instant green card. I think that there is a problem when our benevolence as a nation (allowing third worlders in, allowing kids born here to be citizens) is abused by those seeking to skirt the legal requirments and then try to illicit an emotional responce instead of a legal one. If this boy and his mother want to be together no one is stopping that from happening. No one is stopping these people from making modern upgrades to their own nation either. It's not America's fault that Mexico sucks. There is no other law that I can break and then flaunt in the media and then get off the hook by telling the judge some contrived sob story. Likewise, what other country is going to allow me to break in illegally and then allow me to stay just because I spawned an anchor baby? I'm not a fan of being blackmailed for a vote over this issue. Someone might eventually suggest deportation with a DNA database where anyone caught illegally in the US gets automatically denied any type of re-entry. I don't want my boat to sink just because someone on another boat doesn't want to patch their own broken hull.  on another note, It is time to revamp social security cards. I can reproduce a valid looking SS card with a scanner and a bubble jet printer. so can they. I want to see our system of employment verification rely on debit card-like technology rather than reproducable federal ID and an i-9 form that wont catch anything for 6 months. Half the problem would be solved if some savvy politician thrust some modern tech into this issue. If I could get indication of work eligibility status immediatly instead of 6 months then perhaps we could also crack down on the Identity Fraud too. I've literally seen people come in and apply in the morning with one number, be told that I can see that it is a fake, and come back in the afternoon with another number; also a fake. debit card readers and magnetic strips woudl go a LONG LONG LONG way. If you are secretly a politician with clout and reading this then do it. now. Your next term will be guarenteed.	Shogun	border	 false

In your opinion, taking the above into consideration, should the slave owning south have had the same rights to shape their own lives and their own nation? To what extent would you think it appropriate to interfere if a nation, say Mexico, were blatantly active and prosperous in the slave trade? specifically the sex slave trade? I'm trying to gauge how absolute is the right to autonomously shape the lives and nations of a people.  </quote>  I understand your question, its a good one and will always come up...When is it ok to interferre?  This has to be one that is always carefully weighed and when we do determine to interferre on a humanitarian basis we must make sure not to inteferre in the community carrying out its political will (establishing its own govts, laws, customs etc). There have been many scholars who believe you should NEVER interferre, even in the case of humanitarian causes (which are always suspect and its hard to find even one example in history where a nation would do so for purely altruistic reasons).  The example you give is a good one, but this one was determined by the people of the nation internally in a civil war. Although I also would argue it was the souths RIGHT to suceede and become their own political community. The slave trade itself was not domestic, it went OUTSIDE its borders and captured foreigners to become slaves and on that basis the international community could step in and rescue kidnapped foreigners and ancestors as well as stop them from invading other lands to kidnap more.  On mexico, if they were to engage in a sex slave trade and prosper and this was a legal act (mexico making it legal on an official basis). I would consider it a deep violation of human rights but it would have to be the community itself that stood up to stop it. I would agree with other deterrents such as cutting of diplomatic ties, trade etc to nations who are in such violations. We have another option, we could join the world court and establish national human rights and be able to bring leaders who violate them to court for such things and leave nations to work out their own political lives and futures without invasions or occupations.  Here is the bottomline though, IF it is determined (and there are cases it could be) that a foreign nation should interferre to help people inside a foreign community, then it should be limited to stopping a human rights violation AND NOT go beyond. The foreign community cannot change its borders, be part of selecting new govts, create new laws etc.  Can you find an example of a purely altruistic act such as you are describing by any nation in any time of history? The reason I ask this of you is to make the point that we are asking for somthing that dosent really happen and if we are to be honest, the humanitarian cause is more often the EXCUSE or rationale given for a nations own selfish reasons...thats the trap.  Keep in mind that all governments have a duty to protect the lives of their citizens and only put them on the line to benefit their own society....is it even ok to ask people to give up their lives for another nation while not benefitting their own in any way? Is this the right of our leaders? These are also questions that arise.	Ruby	On	 false

Included in USAIDs work in Mexico are programs to prevent and control infectious diseases (such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS), form partnerships between U.S. and Mexican higher education institutions, improve management of natural resources, and broaden access to financial opportunities. In addition, USAID collaborates with the Mexican government to achieve higher standards on accountability and openness.  </quote>  Thats 33 million from just ONE of the agencies the US uses to interferre and corrupt peoples right to self-determine.  <a href="http://www.ned.org/grants/06programs/grants-lac06.html#mexico">http://www.ned.org/grants/06programs...06.html#mexico</a>  You can choose mexico, they dont give a lump sum they just give various money amount to various "projects" and you can see them for yourself.  We are doing the SAME exact things to Mexico as we do to the rest and how lethal we get depends on how much they fight us.  There is also much evidence that Mexico suffered some of the same kind of voter tampering we had in the US (surprise surprise) and many legitimate voters were stripped of their right to vote and another SHOCK....they came from the poor districts and were believed to be more inclined to vote for the one the US govt wasnt backing.

Stop blaming the US for shit that is not our fault. The right tears you up when you insist as much. MEXICO could give it's people more if it wanted to. It doesn't because they are just as susseptable to greed as anyone else and have allowed THEMSELVES to perpetuate a cycle where the poor remain poot and the wealthy remain wealthy.

I honestly dont know, I might also try to run and save my sons life.  I also dont think people would stand up and rebel as you think they would in america.....people have a tendency to take a HUGE amount of shit before they really stand up and put their very LIVES and families lives on the lines.  In many ways we already have that problem to some degree but its not a nation as much as it is corporate business interests. We take that and allow our govt to place their needs above ours. We also take a good deal of money from lobby groups who represent Israels needs (and not ours) and due to this Israel is our NUMBER 1 recipient of US tax dollars and they get billions per year. I have definitely been an activist and tried to get that to stop, we shouldnt be accepting any monies from a group thats express purpose is a foreign nations interest.  I agree that ultimately they are going to have to fight the forces no matter how large and powerful those forces are but that dosent change our own responsiblity to control our own govt. We cant even seem to do that and yet we are asking them to do so much more arent we?

Canada	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-212-191667-3083646	Tophatter,  Hell, even Canadians don't know our warrior heritage. Canada was the 3rd most powerful country on earth at the end of WWII with the 3rd largest land army, 2nd or 3rd largest navy (depending if you count tonnage or ships), and the 4th largest AF, add to a vibrant industry that was undamaged by war and of course, cash up the ying-yang (everybody outside of North America owes Canada money for war supplies).  However, I wished I could say that the people in the know don't forget. Canada has a reputation of punching far above its weight, deploying forces in numbers that larger militaries (aka the Turks, Italians, Germans) would not deploy.  Every ship in Maritime Command (aka the Canadian Navy) has been deployed at least once, if not twice, in the past two years.  Just a side note, on 11 Sept, Canadian and American fighters patrol the entire North American airspace under NORAD auspicies with no respect to borders. It was unpractical for planes to turn back at the border when they still had effective rnage. NATO planes training in Labrador also took to the skies to man their positions with all weapons hot. In theory, non-American planes could have shot down American airliners though that would be through the orders of the POTUS.  The Americans asked for and got a Canadian battle group (3 PPCLI) in Afghanistan.  Canada is not allowed to say no to any deployment request. At best, we're offerred a choice but we're going.  When the Macedonian shit hit the fan, Canada offerred 4 observers. NATO demanded and got an entire coy. Rumsfeld offerred a choice to Canada. Take command of the ISAF or committ a bde to OIF. The coward Chretien chosed the former.  I said that Chretien is a coward not so much as saying no to OIF. He was respecting the majority wishes of the Canadian public. He was a coward for committing an entire bde without knowing just how dangerous and how ill prepared we are for that mission. He should have just say no and leave it at that.  I don't know about Dieppe's effects on D-Day though. If you look at the prep work of the various beaches, the Canadians by far got the most paperwork and had more rehersals than anybody else. The Americans got the least amount of prepwork relatively speaking (still a hell of alot in overall amount). The Americans also got alot of experience from the USMC actions in the Pacific though how much actually is transferred is debatable but suffice to say, the Americans knew how to land.  The only thing that was confirmed by D-Day is that a prepared opposed landing is not going to work.	Officer of Engineers	reputation	 false

Canada	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-212-191667-3083646	Colonel Good post and some especially good history. I think most Canadians don't know of your warrior heritage and history simply because Canada has never been known as a "warlike" country like Great Britain,France,Germany, and the USA. Nothing at all wrong with that, in fact that's probably why Canadians can travel to just about anywhere and not have people heaving insults at them. "Yankee Go Home" ring a bell here guys? One of the things that warmed my heart after September 11 was the glowing reports of Canadians throwing open their homes (and their arms) wide open to stranded Americans. Many Canadians that I chatted with online said, referring to the attacks, that WE have been attacked. There was no "The Americans were attacked". We were all in it together and at a time when the country (hell, the whole world) was reeling from the shock, it was comforting to know that our neighbor to the north was right there in with us. I was especially glad to read your details on the NORAD patrols. It jibed with everything else I've read and heard. As far as Dieppe, I'll have to do some reading on that. It's been quite some years since I read about it, but I seem to recall it mentioning how much of an eye-opener it was and how some good lessons were learned. I'll see what I can find and post it on the History forum.	TopHatter	simply	 false

Canada	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-212-191667-3083646	Wouldnt French Canada (Quebec) be the most probable to want to to join the USA.  They are seperationists. And Quebec as an independent nation is just not probable. Most likely they would then become part of the USA.  Though, Canada's population has been steadily declining, thus I don't think it will be necessary to join the USA now.  And not to mention the history between the colonies and Canada and the USA and Canada has not been the most friendly. In more recent years with events such as wars Canada and the USA work together.  And the trade between the countries.  Why would any of the other provinces want to join the USA. My impression is that Quebec is the most likely to secede from the Canadian Confederacy. Being that it is the most independent province legally. That dates back to when England gained control of upper Canada and the King made an agreement with Quebec that they shall be generally left alone and the King will not try to enforce laws that are un-wanted, as King learned not to do earlier in the New World. I think that was with the Acadians.  French Canada, has had a history of wanting to be independent of the rest of the Canadian confederacy for quite sometime now.	tw-acs	Quebec	 false

The rest were not very well trained militiamen who had no legal obligation to fight outside the United States.  The first invasion attempt wasn't even a fight. If I remeber correctly Hull almost got executed for his incompotence. The second one was a fairly even match(something like 1500 Soldiers from US and 1300, half of which were British and Native American). The third one Canadians and British were outnumbered something like 20:1 and we had our ass handed to us, lol.  The British Empire and Canada gained nothing from the war however, America took British Influence out of the US and they stoped "impressing" our ships.

Canada	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-212-191667-3083646	Praxus,  I think you have a misunderstanding on how Canada view herself pre-WWII. Canada was not a country but a Dominion of the British Empire, a Bastion of the British Empire. Canada saw Herself as an equal voice within the Empire but very much part of the Empire.  Very much like your States pre-Civil War days. Thus, it is not quite fitting to seperate Canada and the British Empire as if they were two different entities. They were not.  Also, could you tell me what holdings the British had in New Orleans/Louisanna? I was not aware of any pre-1812 and the Paris Treaty stated a return to all pre-war borders.

Canada	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-212-191667-3083646	A result of the 11 Sept was a study in how to restructure the trade bwt the two countries. Can't recall it at the moment but done by Queen's University and Boston University.  Essentially, what the US buys from Canada is raw materials and energy (ie oil - 5 out of 6 Canadian produced oil barrels goes to the US). Replacing those in alot of cases would be cost prohibitive.  I'll use oil and the Auto Pact as the example. There is simply no way for the US to rely on oil tankers to replace Canadian oil. In the meantime, American auto industry would be extremely hard pressed to meet parts demand (based upon their Just In Time supply chain) based upon an ever diminishing buyer market (higher oil prices).  I'll leave the ripples to your logical conclusions.  The Free Trade Agreement between the two countries has gone too far for it to be dismissed as inconsequential and non-fatal for both countries.

Canada sucks because lots of New Yorkers were at the Jays-Yankees game. Nothing Chretien says can be construed as popular opinion. Most Canadians hate him. Not that everyone is so enamored with America, and if you consider that ungrateful, fine ( I do like the US, but many Canadians don't, but its not like they act on it).  And now you have a beef with the Canadian Forces too?	ZFBoxcar	sucks	 false

That would make them American soldiers first and foremost and thus would that make them Mexican Nationals or American immigrants? </quote>  My point was they are not naturalized citizens, I was just facetiously making a point that there are a lot of illegal aliens in the country, which I have no problem with unless they are terrorist.

Canada	suny_albany	bolt-eng-DF-212-191667-3083646	Anthony I suggest you read up on current events and history before you spout off about a close allie of your country. Most of all I hope you learn some damn respect. I seriously hope all of new york isn't as ignorant as you. While new yorkers died in the WTC, Canadian airports were swamped with Americans unable to return home and barely getting any news on what was happening other than the U.S. was attacked. We didn't kick the americans out, we fed them, comforted them and sheltered them in our own homes. If you could only visualize how many empty airliners were parked at Vancouver and Abbotsford you could acctually visualize just how swamped canada was. No one complained...not one bit. You mistake one man's (cretien) sentament as the sentament of the whole nation which shows your complete lack of brains and gonads. Stop assuming every nation should be a clone of your nation, thats not how it works in this world. The sooner you can get that little fantacy out of your head you may acctually start to learn something.	smilingassassin	spout	 false

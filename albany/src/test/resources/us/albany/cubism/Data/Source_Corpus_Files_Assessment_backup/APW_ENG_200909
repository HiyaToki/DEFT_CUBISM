<P>
Israel's government says it is "appalled and disappointed" with the U.N. report on the Gaza war earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The report says both Israel and the Islamic Hamas rulers of Gaza apparently committed war crimes during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said Tuesday that the U.N. body has "dealt a huge blow to governments seeking to defend their citizens from terror."
</P>
<P>
He said Israel is "appalled and disappointed" at the report's equating Israel and Hamas, ignoring that Hamas triggered Israel's invasion by firing thousands of rockets at the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Palmor said the report's conclusions, released Tuesday, "are so disconnected with realities on ground that one cannot but wonder on which planet was the Gaza Strip they visited."

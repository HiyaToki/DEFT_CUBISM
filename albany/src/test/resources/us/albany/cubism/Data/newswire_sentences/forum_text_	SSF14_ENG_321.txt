Not only would I not want this Neanderthal clown in the White House, I wouldn't even want him working on White House property - as gardener, janitor, or anything else.

Ron Paul's stance on this issue is that you cannot legislate morality, and by giving special privileges or entitlements to one group you strip the rights of another.

So you can't prove him wrong and all you have left is teh crying game.

Here is the full video, people can watch it and judge for themselves if Ron Paul is a racist.

Spin all you wish, but he still voted NO.

And he was the only one who voted NO.

Paul's stance on the issue indicates his ignorance of – or contempt for – the Constitution, its case law, and the rule of law.

And no one lost his rights in favor of another.

Paul would allow all of that.

assuming he could get the laws changed.

Ron Paul is only half nuts - but that half is REALLY NUTTY.

Which became; You must hire a minority, even if he's less qualified.

Paul is not nuts, hes ignorant, as is his followers.

He's a racist huh?

Nobody in this thread has called Ron Paul a racist (admittedly, the words "nuts" and "neanderthal" have been bandied about).

People have merely noted that he criticized the Civil Rights act.

As Michael Gerson put it ( <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ron-pauls-quest-to-undo-the-party-of-lincoln/2011/12/30/gIQAOrlyUP_story.html">Ron Paul&amp;rsquo;s quest to undo the party of Lincoln - The Washington Post</a> )

"Whatever his personal views, Paul categorically opposes the legal construct that ended state-sanctioned racism."

Ron Paul's very idea that business is somehow completely "private" is specious.

Stuff like this is why Ron Paul is not a viable candidate in the general election.

Ofcourse he voted no!

Ron Paul needs to learn that there are times when you put aside your libertarianism and do something because it is the right thing to do

Clearly this concept is way too complicated for you to understand, but Ron Paul is correct.

If you had a lick of sense, you'd title this thread, "Ron Paul stands up for liberty for all".

Paul's stance is that of an unreformed bigot.

Veronique de Rugy from the August/September 2011 issue

In Political Determinants of Federal Expenditure at the State Level, published by the journal Public Choice in 2005, two University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa economists, Gary Hoover and Paul Pecorino, note that residents of low-population states have more per capita representation in Congress, since every state, regardless of population, has two senators.

That edge, Hoover and Pecorino argue, translates into more federal handouts.

Sure he did, and good for him.

Ron Paul doesn't support the war on Drugs, and I doubt Euthanasia.

He doesn't support abortion but he recognizes that it is not the federal governments jurisdiction and should be differed to the states.

I have said many times that Liberals would do good to support Ron Paul.

You do realize that Ron Paul is only a member of the GOP because he can't get anywhere as a Libertarian right?

Ron Paul does not stand up for peoples who's liberty is being denied because of skin color

Why do we care what one democrat voter thinks about Ron Paul, during the republican nomination process?

We don't even need your ass in the general, because we already know that tens of millions of idiots are going to vote for Obama regardless.

Ron Paul has a corrupt view of Liberty

Ron Paul does not see that as a violation of liberty?

Ron Paul and Libertarians don't suffer from that kind of blindness and hypocrisy.

Ron Paul stands for liberty for ALL, not just special interest groups.

This qoute, like many responses to Paul's views, is misleading demagoguery, if not an outright lie.

It insinuates that Paul supports state-sanctioned racism - the opposite of his position on the Civil Rights Act.

In fact, the banning of Jim Crow laws is the part of the act he agrees with and why he wouldn't consider repealing it.

What Paul is doing here, what the status quo pundits find so repugnant, is speaking up for property rights.

He's questioning the assumption that its necessary, or even a good idea, to put government in charge of deciding who we must do business with or for what reasons we can decline.

Ron Paul should be ashamed of himself

I don't expect anything from Ron Paul - TODAY - to try to damage control what he did in the past.

Newt Gingrich can always become a faithful husband, Ron Paul can't stop being a lunatic.

Southern Republicans did not support civil rights.......neither does Ron Paul

If given the choice of defending civil rights or defending his libertarian principles, Ron Paul is willing to sacrifice civil rights

Ron Paul keeps on saying that we are in debt.

What a damned fool he is.

except paul isn't a libertarian...

he's just a nutbar...

Can you quote me something, ANYTHING, where Paul thinks government should "interfere with reproductive choice"?

But I think you might want to re-read.

He's adamantly opposed to Jim Crow laws and state-sanctioned racism.

That's the part of the Act he agrees with.

for delusional paulians who think this idiot is a libertarian:

But I think we're all well aware of Paul's position on abortion.

Fortunately, he's opposed to making it a federal issue.

I'd rather he were pro choice myself.

That's one of a handful of issues I disagree with him on.

But given that I agree with him on 85% of the issues and disagree with the other candidates on 85% of the issues, the choice if obvious.

Nice to see the truth about Paul coming out.

He's elitist and racist.

And, he's a liar.

OTOH, all this came out the last time he ran and it didn't seem to bother the Republicans who voted for him.

I don't think of Ron Paul as a racist.

I just think he is too wrapped up in his libertarian values to do what is right.

He is perfectly willing to trade away civil rights, gay rights and worker rights if they conflict with his libertarian values

Paul believes that when you protect the rights of one group not to be discriminated against,

I believe that Paul and his supporters truly believe that libertarian values, once implemented, will result in a kind of civil rights utopia, that state regulation, no matter how well-intended, has an inadvertently adverse effect on civil liberties.

He does his best to avoid "ends justify the means" reasoning.

It's this conviction that is at the core of his ideology.

It's what drives him to take on sensitive issues no one else will touch.

It's the reason he speaks out against our insane foreign policy, the drug war, the growing police state, corporatism and all the other issues that no one else wants to raise.

He knows the demagogues will have a field day with it, but at least it gets us talking (and hopefully thinking) about important issues that other leaders would rather we ignored.

Ron Paul's ideal version of the bill, which I understand to include those restrictions on public entities but exclude those on private entities, would have been a dramatically weaker half-measure.

Pauls hands off, let everything take care of itself viewpoint is not leadership.

Ronald explains it much better than I...

If each man has an equal claim to liberty, that is, the use of his rights, he can be limited in his freedom only by the claims of other men to an equal share of liberty.

 Ronald Cooney, The Freeman [October 1972]

"undermine[d] the concept of liberty" and "destroyed the principle of private property and private choices." I wonder if he was speaking on the behalf of blacks or whites when he said this?

I was asking IF we were able to do it without sacrificing the principles Paul is speaking up for, don't you think it would have been better?

Paul is showing why he is unfit to lead this country.

He has never accomplished anything as a Congressman.

All he does is stand by his simplistic principles and vote No.

Paul's view of the presidency is to use his veto power to enforce his principles whether it is good for the country or not.

That is why Paul will never be elected.

He allows idealism to overturn practicality

"Natural rights" are a concept created by man for man.

As an African American who was born and raised in Mississippi, and as a republican who plans on voting for Ron Paul in the primary, I'll say this:

I understand Paul's view of the world.

I understand Paul's reasoning behind not supporting civil rights legislation.

He does not believe that government should intervene in the practices of private businesses.

I also want to say, though I agree with Paul on many issues (anti-gun control, less regulation, audit the fed, prohibition, freedom of speech, less taxes, control the border, no U.N., end the EPA, smaller government, bring troops home, etc) I completely disagree with him on this issue.

The big difference between myself and Paul here is that I believe I have a right not to be discriminated against because of the color of my skin, while he does not see this as a right, but theorizes that the free market will take care of itself when it comes to discrimination (ie when people see that businesses are racist, they won't go and those businesses will be boycotted/abandoned and either have to close or change their business policies).

With that said, though I don't agree with Paul on THIS, I still believe he's the best choice for this nation at this present time, and I do not believe his stance on this issue comes from his being prejudice or racist, but because he has a fundamentally different understanding of the issue than I do and many others do.

I disagree with his understanding.

But I disagree respectfully, seeing the merit in his arguments.

If you really want to talk about Paul's record on issues regarding race, let's talk about addressing the government run drug war which Paul understands is statistically detrimental to the African American community.

Ron Paul is not against blacks having the same rights as whites.

He isn't.

Because unlike you, he knows what he's talking about.

You do realize that Paul's objection to RvW is on the grounds that it infringes on state's rights right?

His pro-life stand is his personal view.

Of course you don't, it would ruin your made up view of him.

I've seen Paul on this subject before.

It's easy to jump to the conclusion that his is a racist position, but I don't believe that to be the case.

Paul was all for striking down the Jim Crow laws, but thought that was as far as the federal government could or should go.

Where he had a problem was in prohibiting a private business from discriminating on the basis of race.

He believes in an absolute right of a business owner to conduct his business as he sees fit, no matter how wrong and appalling the basis for his decisions.

I disagree with him, of course.

Or at least that is how I see it, and why I believe that Paul and other free-market purists are wrong.

Even Paul has changed his views on capital punishment.

I dont agree with Ron Paul on everything, thank god we have 50 different states and he plans to return the power to them.

They are both dead and Ron Paul is running for president

Paul/Santorum 2012!! They didn't mean it!

It's interesting how once you get below the surface of Ron Paul's more publicized appeal to the so-called isolationists (like myself)

you find yourself at the real core of his support,

I'm no racist either, however as a libertarian our government has ZERO right telling others what position to hold on others.....

The racists and "anti-government crazies" are going to vote for whoever the republican nominee is.

Don't pin that group on Paul.

PLENTY of people are going to vote R in 2012 because he ain't "the nigger".

Nick.....you are a twisted man child. But you know that

Here is the way it worked man child.

You're an idiot.

Sure there were instances of democrats flipping republican out of spite, however that had nothing to with political ideology and everything to do with some opposing the democrats for using blacks as a political tool rather than continuing to oppress them.

its a good we have all these white liberals looking out for these colored folk that dont know what a racist Paul is...

Obviously this idiot voted for Obama and most likely will again. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

Besides I would LOVE for someone to contradict my argument against my assertions other than "you're a fucking idiot."

So its not exactly like you have exclusive admission to those letters, all of which known have been reilliterated to the general public...

Liberals want to sit around and accuse Ron Paul of being a racist while the socialist dictator steers the country towards totalitarianism.

Second - I'm not talking about texts of these things that are online, idiot.

Reagan's War on Drugs and Bush's War on Terror gave the federal government sweeping new powers to intervene in the life and destiny of the states.The only freedoms they protect are those of large corporations.

Yeah--what did anyone expect--it wasn't too long ago that his son--Rand Paul stated that under the constitution and personal property rights--a restaurant owner--if the owner wishes should be able to keep minorities out of his restaurant.

Then they throw a fit over Paul's stance on the CRA, like they care about racism.

But at least they have Ron Paul defending their liberty and freedom to ban negroes and apes while they pay honor to Jesus

See? Has nothing at all to do with Ron Paul.

Dr Paul says we should have let social forces regulate businesses that discriminate on the basis of race.

Among the hundreds of other ways the lefties here are wrong about RP, they think he;'s actually a republican.

What is Ron Paul doing in the Republican Primaries?

Ron Paul is not a Republican.

He can't get anywhere as a libertarian.

What makes Dr Paul think that giving the free market more time would have led to any improvement?

So Dr Paul is lying to the public and misrepresenting himself

The last thing I want to be is a Ron Paul defender but even radical lefties and Huffington probably understand deep down that Paul is no racist.

Paul is your best bet to lose the election if he wins the nomination.

Ronald Reagan was a Democrat until 1962.

God.....that Dr Paul is a smart guy

Ron Paul fully agreed with the former, which pundits and partisans conveniently like to ignore.

If Ron Paul being honest enough to reveal this truth is disgusting and offensive to you people, then you need to wake up and smell the roses because government has no power to make us better people.

And Ron Paul supported the provisions of the Civil Rights Act that ended Jim Crow laws and the like that forced and encouraged segregation.

Ron Paul supported ending all segregation in public laws.

Ron Paul is 50 years behind the times

Ron Paul is right.

-Ron Paul

The main problem Ron Paul and people like myself have about the bill is title II, not the whole thing.

Ron Paul as the sole no.

I would like to say I would never tolerate such nonsense if my "values" were shoved down anothers throat but I'm a libertarian hence it wouldn't make any sense.

So surely he must disagree with Ron Paul, right?

He agrees completely with Ron Paul.

Ron Paul isn't the Republican party and he speaks for himself..

He's just running as a republican...

The only reason why he ran as a republican is because most republicans (or voters for that matter) really don't understand classical liberalism and immediately write off libertarians as loons.

I had to work with one of those idiots who was "openly gay" and this idiot was so open he constantly talked about his sexual encounters loudly and "proudly" at the work place...

The idiot only kept his job because management was too scared to fire his ass out of worries of a lawsuit..

Maybe, just fucking maybe Ron Paul could be right.

Paul is 100 percent right.

I'm sure a lot of things make your head spin, idiot.

I'm a libertarian - I don't believe the government has the right to tell anyone what they need to do, weather I agree or not with the idea.

Wrong again, moron.

I think Ron Paul already is

One of Ron Paul's key faults as a politician is that he doesn't respect demagoguery.

Ron Paul isn't railing against the Civil Rights Act.

That is Supermans motto......not Ron Paul's

The fact that Ron Paul does bring it up is on of the reasons I like him.

For Ron Paul to seek to deny people the right to attend the college of their choice, eat at a public lunch counter, be seated in a restaurant, swim in a public pool or stay in a hotel solely because some racists believe them to be subhuman shows why Paul is unfit to be President

Ron Paul is against civil rights? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>

So Ron Paul is ok with segregation, but wants to legalize drugs?

oh boy. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

When you honestly answer this, think about this, what if Paul could have had anything to do with passing the civil rights act.

People died for civil rights and for him to spit on them is disgusting in my opinion.

Ron Paul is perfectly fine with segregation as long as the government is not doing it

That is Ron Paul's vision of America

Ron Paul clearly hates blacks, as evidence of all the free healthcare he gave to minorities.

This sums it up perfectly for Paul.

Dr.

Paul, it is not 1961.

That is the world as Ron Paul sees it

It wouldnt have happened if Ron Paul was calling the shots

And Ron Paul would be perfectly fine in letting them

As I said above, I understand where Paul is coming from -- not racism, but a belief in an absolute right of a business owner to conduct his business as he chooses, regardless of any other considerations -- but I disagree.

Why are people acting like Paul wants mandated segregation?

But Ron Paul is a Republican in name only and running as one only out of necessity.

But not supporting the civil rights act does not make Paul a racist.

However as a libertarian the would have every right to refuse to serve a minority...

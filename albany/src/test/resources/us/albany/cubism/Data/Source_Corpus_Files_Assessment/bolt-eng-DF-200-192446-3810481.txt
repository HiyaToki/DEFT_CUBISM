Do you prefer New York or London?

<post author="ak56" datetime="2010-02-21T13:55:00" id="p1">
This is very much subjective, but which city do you prefer? Both cities I guess are pretty comparable, both roughly the same sized, both of similar world notability and both very diverse.

However, I'd have to say I prefer New York, despite being the same sized, in my opinion New York has a much grander feel about it, modern and historic buildings work really well together, while in many parts of London arcetechture is really **** and imo distracts from the good aspects of London.

Also, on the two occasions I've been to New York, Manhattan feels significatly safer than Central London in terms of getting mugged, beaten up, etc. And even in the rougher parts of New York, if you keep yourself to yourself in the day you're fairly safe, which is more than I can say for some parts of London.

They don't have any historic buildings, everything is from the last 150 years and most of it from the last 80.

I prefer New York to visit but I couldn't live there. Its not green enough and although its a planning mess I find it more interesting than NY which is like milton keynes in layout (manhatten anyway). I find them fairly similar though.

I've never been to New York so I can't really compare the two. London's okay, but I'm not really a fan of massive cities. I hate the constant crowds and business in central London; in Edinburgh if I go into town at the right time of day or the right point in the year (ie not tourist season), the number of people is just about bearable. London, in my experience, is always insanely crowded.

I like New York for the fact it was just an island of skyscrapers,I wouldn't want that here so its nice to visit there as its overwhelming and a good busy vibe.
Though working in London has made me hate everything about it,so I'd say New York is much better.

I voted London instinctively because I love it there, but I have some good memories of NY, it's really just the size and the heat and the rain that puts me off. I maybe prefer NY people though. We were walking down the street and this businessman in a suit walked past grinning and singing to himself all loudly and happily, like some sort of cheesy advert, it was amazing.

Their fashion can sometimes be a bit lacking though.

Never been to New York, and I envy my Human Geography colleagues for being able to go there next year (although we get to go to Almeria in Spain <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":cool:"/> ), but I doubt it compares to the imperial majesty of central London. London is a city where every street has a story, and every building a tale. New York's glitz and commercialism may be impressive, but dig deeper and the reasons for much of New York's construction are boring and mundane.

Manhattan's, maybe, due to police essentially fortifying that borough under orders from Giulani way back when. But take the five boroughs as a whole, or indeed the wider metropolitan area, and New York is one of the most criminally active places in the Western World.

London by a landslide... but I like New York too and it's quite likely I will end up living there.

New York is too garish and 'trying too hard' in places. London doesn't have to try hard to be fabulous... it just is. I prefer the old architecture and history of London to the modern bright lights of NYC.

I've never been to New York, but I think I would love it. However, I've been to London hundreds of times and I know I love it! There's so much history everywhere, and green parks, and things to see and do, different markets, brilliant shops and places to eat and drink... I've never been mugged or been a victim of crime there, either.

EDIT: I think a lot of people are saying New York because of the novelty of it - London doesn't seem as interesting because they've lived in Britain all their lives - 'familiarity breed contempt', if you will.

NYC has advantages:

Travel :
Its the same population on half the space so commuting is cut down significantly. You seem to spend half your life travelling <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/> in London.

Tubes run 24hrs, and express trains run much faster with fewer stops, and their tube are more reliable to boot (their map system is damn confusing <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/> though)

Nightlife:
Central London closes down far too early, ridiculously early for a hub city. Even with the new licensing laws it's a ghost town past 23:00. The crappy clubs outweigh the good ones in the centre. You have to travel east for a decent nightlife. Even then you struggle for a quiet spot-and you can forget about fresh food.

I easily found a quiet bar open at 2am where I could enjoy a conversation up till 5 am.

Food:
NYC has incredible quality cheap food. The Pizzas are cheap and out of this world! The Calzones were utterly indescribable and for that price. insane.

You can order good quality food, at that quiet late night bar you easily found opened. Piping hot, brought to your table, and thoroughly enjoyable and affordable.

A very nice club seated my friend and I where we enjoyed light sea food platters, before hitting the dance floor. The club was amazing, pricey but the same experience in the UK would have been beyond our means as students.

Attitude:
Strangers came up and talked to me in bars and clubs. People had a get up and go attitude and I made a lot of contacts useful contacts. NYC is the place to make things happen if your not from a privileged well connected background.

Iv'e been to:

San Fran,

Fort Lauderdale,
The Keys,
Orlando,
New York,
Boston,
Cape Cod,
Somewhere in New England I've forgotten the name of.

So yes, there is a lot that I've missed and OK So I was last in the US in
'01 and its probably entirely changed since then however.

By fake I meant (and are you asking the same of the person who actually used the word? They might have a different take on it compared to me) fake as in 'fake happiness', theres a lot of actual stuff which is fake such as the cheese but I'd pin it down much closer to just the fake happiness of the US.

I friend of mine went to Chicago and on a receipt it said 'Thank you for letting me serve you today'. Printed on each and every receipt was a note of thanks for servitude. I think that exemplifies it nicely.

You mention areas distracting from the good parts of London, which does suggest you haven't seen anything other than the good parts of Manhattan Island - the financial sector etc as well as the good surrounding areas. If you know someone from there, get them to take you on a real tour of New York. Not far from all the bright lights of the centre are areas that look like slums (and no, nothing you have seen in London comes close to how bad they are) and it's not very safe at all. Even hidden away in the centre are some pretty dreadful sights. That said some of the suburbs are very nice, but are mainly for the wealthy.

Overall London is my preference, everything good about New York London has just as good, and often better. It's also much safer - and the skyscrapers look ridiculous and don't make for a good city (well, I suppose when your very high up they cool which is handy if your rich and can afford a high up penthouse)

And London is not full of Americans, that should be enough to convince anyone.

Actually, the times I've visited because of budget I've stayed in hotels in rather working-class areas of Queens and Brooklyn. In these areas it has been evident that they are the sort of places where crime definately does exist under the surface, but I never felt unsafe in any of them, there certainly was not the apmosphere of tension and risk that does exist in many rough parts of London, even during the day.

In my experience, in 2010 the roughest parts of New York are no worse than the roughest parts of London, and as in New York there is a more defined destinction between good areas and bad areas, you are safer in New York than you are in London.

I think you have the mentality of a bye-gone era where New York was the big bad city and London was rather qaint and gentile. The reality is in the last 10 years the two cities have receachd a par in terms of crime, if not somewhat switched roles.

It was so overwhelming, and London I found to be disgustingly busy to the point of nausea, and I wasn't 'overwhelmed' like I was when I saw New York.

Then again, there's so much of London I haven't seen and I prefer England to America any day.

I have family there, visited a few times. Its not exactly as diverse as London, and considering you would still say London is full of British I think my point stands <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/p.gif" alt=":p:"/>

In my experience, in 2010 the roughest parts of New York are no worse than the roughest parts of London, and as in New York there is a more defined destinction between good areas and bad areas, you are safer in New York than you are in London.

I think you have the mentality of a bye-gone era where New York was the big bad city and London was rather qaint and gentile. The reality is in the last 10 years the two cities have receachd a par in terms of crime, if not somewhat switched roles.

</quote>

I would disagree, it was about a year and a half ago that I went and some of the areas were bad, very bad. I was talking to people from around there that some of some family friends know and was warned not to walk around the area at all if possible. Driving around that day I even saw a couple of people roaming around with guns on display (I admit this took me by surprise). Although some of these are small areas, nothing even close to this exists in London so it is not some "mentality".

But I think you do have a point that, as a tourist, your unlikely to see anything like this, and some people may feel safer there than London. The problem is that this is a concerted effort by the city to make it feel safe. It does not mean it is any more safe than London at all, it just feels that way. If London were to make even half that effort (and it would only need to be half the effort after the difference I saw) then it would feel just as safe to these people.

You also have a point about the areas being defined more, but I would rather be a city that happens to have a small criminal element around the place like any normal area would, than one that has a huge effort to keep safe areas but with huge almost no go areas existing. On the streets of London you may have more of a chance to get you pocket picked. On the streets of New York, get lost and you could be in serious trouble.

This may be true, however, there are a couple of reasons why the situation in New York is better than London. There is a lot more definition between good areas and bad areas in New York than there is in London. In London I've found a few times you can be walking in what seems like a nice area, and you've strayed slightly from the centre and found yourself in a gang infested ******** unexpectedly.

However, the really rough parts of New York where you have to exercise particularly caucion are quite far removed from Manhattan and its immediate surroundings, so as a tourist, it's pretty easy to avoid ********* in NY, while in London I can imagine tourists run into ********* quite frequently.

Also, the rough areas of New York ultimately pose less risk to an uninvolved stranger than the rough areas of London to.

I've lived 15 minutes from NYC for most of my life. I hate that city. The buildings are so tall they block out the sun, which bothers me. Plus there's too many people, the traffic is awful, and it's too loud. Also, I heard the metro in New York is awful, though I've never been on it before.

London is much nicer. The metro is easy to understand and it's more open, if that makes sense. The tall buildings in NY make it feel like you're in a maze.

London! New York was extremely close to where I grew up (town in New Jersey practically a suburb of NYC). New York drives me mad! The thought of going back to the states to live there makes me hyperventilate. It's just so hectic, too many cars and people not stopping for anything. And buildings that you have to crane your neck to see. The green areas are few and far between, and it is deceptively unwalkable. Also I'd rather tussle with the people in the underground than the crazies you can run into at the New York Metro anyday! There is also something disgustingly pretentious about the young "hip" places of New York like when they re-did St. Marks Place and the East Village. Usually when I have to go for an appointment I hide out in Bryant Park and refuse to move from that little patch of green until the time comes.

But I've also lived in quite diverse and busy areas of London, so idk what my problem is <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/confused.gif" alt=":confused:"/>

i have lived in both and found this to be the case as well. some of the soviet-esq London council estates (which are planned terribly and laid out like a maze) are in the middle of nice areas. they make the projects in NYC look nice in comparison. also, the contrast is less in NYC. in London you can literally cross a road and go from multi-million pound homes to near third world living conditions in 30 seconds.

This is a really tough question and one that I contemplate quite often. I've applied to university both in New York and London, which has prompted me to compare the two quite a deal. In the end, I would say New York is the most amazing city in the world, but London comes right after it. What I love about New York are the skyscrapers, the greed, the constant pace that is so hard to find in London. London is more quaint; it is charming and welcoming. Therefore London is where I'm headed now that I'm 18 and still quite naive. New York's too tough for me right now, I think. It'll be perfect after 3 years in London, though, and besides then I'll be 21 which is ideal for US immigrants. But yeah, I think I'll end up in New York because it's more inspiring. The most amazing sight I've ever seen is the New York skyline in the dark. It's freaking epic!!

There are many more wealthy young people in Manhatten then there are in Central London for sure. This is mostly due to the accesibility of housing (you can afford a small apartment in Manhatten on a graduate salary while in London this is very difficult).

Central London also has more geriatrics because it is calmer and easier to live in, while it is common for yuppies to live in Manhatten throughout their 20's/30's then move to connecticut or jersey to start a family.

And in terms of being successful...Manhatten offers more opportunities in pretty much every industry aside from perhaps finance and law where it is tied with London. i am amazed that anyone can afford to live (and have a decent quality of life) in London without earning 40,000+ GBP a year

**I've edited this one year later, after much personal growth, reflexion, more traveling, experiences, listening to different viewpoints, seeing things in a different way etc. In green underneath. I hope they help someone.

I'm not from London nor NYC. I've lived in London for 4 years and have lived in NYC for 3 months and hands down I prefer London ANYTIME. When I left for NYC from London I was so sure I hated London and couldn't wait to be out of there and was so sure I'd fall in love with NYC...boy was I wrong and the "you never know what you got til it's gone" saying never applied more.

Here's why:

1)Whoever said ppl in NYC are fake was RIGHT. People in London may not be as outgoing, may not walk up to you and talk to you randomly on the streets or be over friendly with you on outings but they are much more down to earth, much more genuine, FRIENDLIER and smile at you in a genuine way and long term relationships are easier!!! In NYC they walk up to you with too much friendliness too soon and then you never hear from them again...I also think NYC is very shallow in that people seem to just talk sex, money, clubbing all the time and nothing else.

I haven't had a single person smile at me during 3 months in NYC but when they do it is FAKE, very fake. The news people in NYC seem very fake. Everything feels very fake.

The cab drivers ARE SO DISRESPECTFUL. Never say hello or thank you.

Ok, one year later I've changed my mind on this. I've realized people in London are actually overly polite and it can be "fake", just to "say it" but not mean it. Americans are more straightforward and don't have to say "sorry, thank you" all the time, doesn't mean they're rude.

About the shallowness of the americans, I have to say americans are MUCH WARMER AND FRIENDLIER. They are more simple and "childlike". I am now prefering this to the Londonders who rationalize too much and lack emotions. Americans have more of a heart and are more generous, hands down.

2) TOO MUCH INDIVIDUALISM in NYC...and too much revolving around money and material things...NYC is much less social meaning people do not sit down and socialize like in London....in London you see people sitting in parcs, cafés etc and talking but in NYC they just sit there and loog good... When I was there all the talking revolves around the oscars, cheezy reality TV and money or how to make it as a star. Seriously...people seem to be so individualistic they lack a certain emotional sensitivity to others and lack interest in others.

I am now seeing this as a good thing. Londoners don't have enough individualism and tend to see everyone "the same", this is really dangerous when you're trying to be different or make something out of yourself, you feel very quickly discouraged. People in america have more faith and a more positive outlook. Granted they have that fake happiness and smile at times, but some of it is not all that fake, I've come to see they really are like that in many ways. They're just more positive. why is this bad? Is the norm being sad and depressed?People in London are just more depressed and seem so sad all the time.

3) Men are very aggressive and women too...the men in London are very polite and do not look at you straight in the eye with the intention to date you. Here in NYC I was aggressed every five minutes with american men asking my number...NO SHAME, they just walk up to you and very very aggressive and direct...they'll immediately start talking about intimacy in rude and lewd terms and if you refuse they insult you !!! The women look at you with JEALOUSY a lot on the streets if you are a pretty girl. Not nice. In London you can feel more girl power and the English girls and foreigner girls who live in London are WAY NICER than the girls in NYC.

I stand by the aggressive thing, HOWEVER I now see I was exxagerating, I think it's a good thing. Londoners don't know how to approach people. Bad thing.

4) NYC as a city is not that green, seems smaller than London...not as much culture or cultural things, everything and I mean absolutely everything revolves around money and celebrities...when you're done with Times Square, central Park, 5th avenue and the likes there's nothing else to see...then it's the same boring thing day in and day out...London is SO HUGE you need a lifetime to explore it all.

So what?

5) The people do not know how to dress, it's a fashion disaster...honestly...its as if everyone is homeless. Girls have less class than in London.

Actually I stand by that fashion is not that good BUT BUT BUT I now see this as a good thing, americans are more down to earth and don't always have to dress up, it's more casual and comfy HOWEVER PEOPLE DRESS BETTER on night outings and going to church and 100% better than those in London

6) SUBWAY IS GROSS AND DIRTY in NYC and so many homeless people in it....10 times more than London !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! London's tube 100% more clean. The people who take subway in NYC seem to be more of the young people with no money whereas thats not the case in London.

Again, the people in subways in america are nicer, there is lively chatting going on all the time, people look at you like a normal human being, if you like privacy a lot not a good thing. In London you do have lively chatting in the evenings when people go clubbing but generally speaking its DEAD and sad. You see people laughing, crying etc, it's more human and less reserved.

7) DIVERSITY sucks in NYC: It's always black, latinos, jews and whites and the rest doesn't count... Its like they know nothing else...sure you got a few chinese, italians and indians in NYC but that's about it and they are not in large numbers...in London ITS AMAZING to have australians, south africans, jews, french, german, indians, latin american people, eastern europeans, canadians asians, NIgerians, somalians, etc etc in LARGE numbers with their own communities, food stores, festivals... and not just 1 or 2...and they each have their own areas...

Ok granted its not their fault but I still hate this.

8) when you go to Times Square on the weekends at night 80% of what you see are young tennagy blacks mostly dressed in Hip Hop Gear...I've never understood why...I once went to the movies in Times Square which would be the equivalent of the Leicester Square Odeon cinema but there were only KIDS in jeans and all black or latinos...

I still stand by that. That was odd.Nothing against black and latinos teenagers but there was only that, so odd, where is the diversity in age and nationality, I was told new yorkers never go to times square but there were not even any tourists there...barely !!!

9) Not enough history in NYC

I see this as positive now, it means ppl are not so stuck in the past

10) Food is not that great to be honest, once you've tried the pizzas and philly cheese steak not much to explore

Well...LOL to that

11) People can be RUDE !!! no manners, THEY STARE AT YOU in the subway, streets....I find London to be BETTER as its more anonymous and people DO NOT STARE AT EACH OTHER

12) Emotionally speaking, I prefer London...people seem more sensitive, human and genuine. In NYC you get a much more "fake" feeling and you always feel like you need to perform and try to be something you're not (its all about money, becoming famous or the best at your job); PEOPLE DO NOT ENJOY LIFE AT ALL....

I don't think this anylonger...

ALL IN ALL....I'll just go to NYC to visit but I could never live there, London is better MUCH MUCH BETTER for genuine relationships, long lasting friendships and for culture and socializing.

I've never liked how everything revolved around money and "making it" in America....they are not laid back and seem to not have any identity apart from STATUS and ACHIEVEMENTS (I'm this and that or try to be this and that or have met such and such...in London ppl talk about their lives and their personalities more)

ANYWAY....be careful with NYC.

They do not take any interest in other people's lives unless there is something in it for themselves...in London you talk to people JUST FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF IT...here in america and NYC...you will NEVER get anyone to just chat to you just for the enjoyment of the convo...it's always something behind their minds...

In fact, it's New York all around - you just can't beat it. It love London, it is beautiful there and I really love it, but New York.. my trip there still seems like a dream, it was so.. breathtaking. I long to live there one day <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

When I left for NYC from London I was so sure I hated London and couldn't wait to be out of there and was so sure I'd fall in love with NYC...boy was I wrong and the "you never know what you got til it's gone" saying never applied more.

Here's why:

1)Whoever said ppl in NYC are fake was RIGHT. People in London may not be as outgoing, may not walk up to you and talk to you randomly on the streets or be over friendly with you on outings but they are much more down to earth, much more genuine, FRIENDLIER and smile at you in a genuine way and long term relationships are easier!!! In NYC they walk up to you with too much friendliness too soon and then you never hear from them again...I also think NYC is very shallow in that people seem to just talk sex, money, clubbing all the time and nothing else.

I haven't had a single person smile at me during 3 months in NYC but when they do it is FAKE, very fake. The news people in NYC seem very fake. Everything feels very fake.

The cab drivers ARE SO DISRESPECTFUL. Never say hello or thank you.

2) TOO MUCH INDIVIDUALISM in NYC...and too much revolving around money and material things...NYC is much less social meaning people do not sit down and socialize like in London....in London you see people sitting in parcs, cafés etc and talking but in NYC they just sit there and loog good... When I was there all the talking revolves around the oscars, cheezy reality TV and money or how to make it as a star. Seriously...people seem to be so individualistic they lack a certain emotional sensitivity to others and lack interest in others.

3) Men are very aggressive and women too...the men in London are very polite and do not look at you straight in the eye with the intention to date you. Here in NYC I was aggressed every five minutes with american men asking my number...NO SHAME, they just walk up to you and very very aggressive and direct...they'll immediately start talking about intimacy in rude and lewd terms and if you refuse they insult you !!! The women look at you with JEALOUSY a lot on the streets if you are a pretty girl. Not nice. In London you can feel more girl power and the English girls and foreigner girls who live in London are WAY NICER than the girls in NYC.

4) NYC as a city is not that green, seems smaller than London...not as much culture or cultural things, everything and I mean absolutely everything revolves around money and celebrities...when you're done with Times Square, central Park, 5th avenue and the likes there's nothing else to see...then it's the same boring thing day in and day out...London is SO HUGE you need a lifetime to explore it all.

5) The people do not know how to dress, it's a fashion disaster...honestly...its as if everyone is homeless. Girls have less class than in London.

6) SUBWAY IS GROSS AND DIRTY in NYC and so many homeless people in it....10 times more than London !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! London's tube 100% more clean. The people who take subway in NYC seem to be more of the young people with no money whereas thats not the case in London.

7) DIVERSITY sucks in NYC: It's always black, latinos, jews and whites and the rest doesn't count... Its like they know nothing else...sure you got a few chinese, italians and indians in NYC but that's about it and they are not in large numbers...in London ITS AMAZING to have australians, south africans, jews, french, german, indians, latin american people, eastern europeans, canadians asians, NIgerians, somalians, etc etc in LARGE numbers with their own communities, food stores, festivals... and not just 1 or 2...and they each have their own areas...

8) when you go to Times Square on the weekends at night 80% of what you see are young tennagy blacks mostly dressed in Hip Hop Gear...I've never understood why...I once went to the movies in Times Square which would be the equivalent of the Leicester Square Odeon cinema but there were only KIDS in jeans and all black or latinos...

9) Not enough history in NYC

10) Food is not that great to be honest, once you've tried the pizzas and philly cheese steak not much to explore

11) People can be RUDE !!! no manners, THEY STARE AT YOU in the subway, streets....I find London to be BETTER as its more anonymous and people DO NOT STARE AT EACH OTHER

12) Emotionally speaking, I prefer London...people seem more sensitive, human and genuine. In NYC you get a much more "fake" feeling and you always feel like you need to perform and try to be something you're not (its all about money, becoming famous or the best at your job); PEOPLE DO NOT ENJOY LIFE AT ALL....

ALL IN ALL....I'll just go to NYC to visit but I could never live there, London is better MUCH MUCH BETTER for genuine relationships, long lasting friendships and for culture and socializing.

I've never liked how everything revolved around money and "making it" in America....they are not laid back and seem to not have any identity apart from STATUS and ACHIEVEMENTS (I'm this and that or try to be this and that or have met such and such...in London ppl talk about their lives and their personalities more)

ANYWAY....be careful with NYC.

I agree that Brits and Europeans in general are more laid back, but in an American's eye that is just laziness.

And you have to remember that people in London may appear more social simply because there is more of a pub culture and people drink much more heavily in the UK.

And with regards to NYC in general, the areas you listed (5'th ave, time square, etc) are dire in my opinion. I am American and much prefer London's touristy areas than NYC's, but to say that Leicester square is nicer or classier is taking it a bit too far <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> NYC in the 20's and below is much nicer and more residential, mid-town is a nightmare at the best of times and I certainly would not want to live there!

And yes, people in NYC are much more career focused and demanding than they are in London, but this is the American attitude and has nothing to do with the city. I have met plenty of people in London who earn 20-30k, live in zone 2 or 3 and are perfectly content in their position. Personally, I find I achieve more when I am surrounded by people who also want to better themselves (whatever that means). I would rather work longer hours, earn more money, and live in zone 1.

People are also more attached to labels in NYC, so your career and education background will pigeonhole you into something that everyone has already established in their minds.

I would also like to know who you were conversing with on a daily basis to only hear conversation about reality television!

And the whole thing about diversity is just crap. America has a much higher black and latino population than Europe does so of course you are going to see more of them. Also, NYC is in a country with 300+ million people while London is in a country with just 60 million. Naturally there are going to be more nationalities in London as you have foreign countries a car drive away, while America only has Canada and Mexico.

This is true but no where near the extent you do in london. The planning in London is notoriously bad but that was due mainly to the blitz

London is much muuuch older than New York. London was a long established city when NY was discovered by Europeans. Native Americans sold the island of Manhattan to European settlers for $24. Nowadays that land is some of the most expensive on earth. London is low-lying and has alotta history, but NY is the center of the universe nowadays.

I haven't been to New York many times and have been to London for my work, so both of them do jingle some good memories in my mind. If asked about a place that I have a good experience then it surely has to be London. The atmosphere, the buses, the cabs, the trains and most importantly the people and the office where I used to work, I just miss them all.

I much prefer New York to London, to be honest. Because:

1) The weather in New York is much more consistent. You actually have seasons lol. You have relatively reliable summers, unlike in London.

2) New Yorkers are more fun and friendly. Londoners are too introverted. Though, having said that, Londoners are more polite. But, of course, politeness does not equal friendliness.

3) New York, or at least much of Manhattan, seems to me to be a more accepting/liberal place than London.

4) There is a vibe/buzz/excitement in New York that you simply do not get in London.

5) The way New York has been designed is so much better than London. You can't get lost in New York. London, on the other hand, is a maze.

Actually, the times I've visited because of budget I've stayed in hotels in rather working-class areas of Queens and Brooklyn. In these areas it has been evident that they are the sort of places where crime definately does exist under the surface, but I never felt unsafe in any of them, there certainly was not the apmosphere of tension and risk that does exist in many rough parts of London, even during the day.

In my experience, in 2010 the roughest parts of New York are no worse than the roughest parts of London, and as in New York there is a more defined destinction between good areas and bad areas, you are safer in New York than you are in London.

I think you have the mentality of a bye-gone era where New York was the big bad city and London was rather qaint and gentile. The reality is in the last 10 years the two cities have receachd a par in terms of crime, if not somewhat switched roles.

I know this is an old post, but not for nothing, there is no way the worst neighborhoods in London are as bad as the worst neighborhoods in New York. I've walked through Brixton at 2 AM on the weekends multiple times and never felt remotely unsafe. The worst thing I saw were people posted up with their pitbull on a leash. I'm sure things happen all the time there, but it wasn't so bad that I couldn't walk through.

In New York, this just isn't the case. You simply cannot walk through neighborhoods like Brownsville, Bed Stuy, East New York, South Jamaica, Queensbridge, Far Rockaway, and most parts of the Bronx at night and pretty much anytime of the day as well. Remember, there are a lot of guns in America and especially in the inner city. Drugs and gangs are a far bigger problem in America than in conservative England. The police in England don't even carry guns and there are far less on the street per capita in London versus NYC. in 2010 there were 135 murders in London. In NYC, there were 532 - you can google this. Other violent crime such as robbery and assault is also far more likely to occur in NYC and at a much higher rate than in London. NYC is just a much wilder place than London because of the Darwinian, Capitalist culture of America and the fact that there is such a high concentration of poverty in a much more overpopulated, dense city. In America, the dollar is king, and everyone is ultra competitive. Everyone is trying to get rich and the poor are killing each other just to survive. Greed is central to crime, and it's just more prevalent on every level in America in general and more so in NYC. Also, most blue collar neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn that have hotels, like LIC, Astoria near the airport etc are actually very safe areas. You can't compare that to walking through the projects at midnight.

NYC is bigger than life, and much of the stuff you see portrayed in movies, actually occurs in the city. London is much more conservative, steeped in tradition and a lot slower paced - in London you don't have 8 lanes of traffic flowing through towering skyscrapers, and sidewalks flooding with people. Don't get me wrong, London is an incredible, world class city, but it just doesn't have the high paced energy, action, and buzz of NYC. The only other developed city that can match NYC in this respect is Tokyo.

I currently live in NYC and used to live in South Kensington. I personally prefer London, it's so vibrant and the architecture is spectacular. It also has such a great energy year round that you really start to miss after leaving.

NYC is great but the sheer grandiosity of it makes it feel fake and much less sincere.

I changed my mind about many things I wrote earlier. I've had one additional year to grow and see things differently, what a difference does a year make. It's based on more traveling, personal growth, studying, observations, learning, meeting new people, listening to different viewpoints, getting older, experiencing things, seeing more clearly and more objectively etc. I'll share under my previous statements about NYC/London in a different color. I know I'm so passionate about this, bear with me, I'm French ! <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/>

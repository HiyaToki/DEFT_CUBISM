PHILLIES CLINCH TITLE, BUT WORRIES ABOUND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PHILADELPHIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Phillies did not know they had clinched their
third consecutive National League East title when Brad Lidge threw
his first pitch Wednesday night. But that did not matter. There was
no one else manager Charlie Manuel wanted on the mound. Summoned
with two outs in the ninth inning, Lidge needed only that one pitch
to secure a 10-3 victory against the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
If the Phillies are to successfully defend their World Series
championship, they will need consistent contributions from Lidge,
who has struggled all season and last week lost his job as closer.
The capacity crowd at Citizens Bank Park showered him with a
standing ovation when he ran in from the bullpen, and it erupted
when Lance Berkman grounded out to first base. Lidge recorded the
final out of the division-clinching win last season, but this time,
he said, was sweeter.
</P>
<P>
"Like Charlie said all year long, he believes in me," a
drenched Lidge said afterward. "It has been a rough year, but I
think he knows when the postseason comes around and these important
games, that I'll be ready to go. And I think he knows I'll throw my
best in these games."
</P>
<P>
Lidge was the final pitcher from a bullpen that pitched five
scoreless innings in relief of Pedro Martinez, who threw an
inefficient 84 pitches and allowed two home runs. Martinez, who had
not pitched since Sept. 13 because of neck stiffness, called this
outing a "tuneup" and said he cared more that he felt great
afterward.
</P>
<P>
"This is my reward for all the things I've been through the
last three years," Martinez said. "I'm totally healthy and I'm
looking forward to doing a lot more for this team than I have so
far."
</P>
<P>
Manuel and some players predicted a muted celebration because,
after all, this was their third straight title, and they are the
defending champions. But unlike the past two years, when they
relied on a furious September comeback to overtake the Mets, the
Phillies have sat atop the NL East every day since May 30. For that
reason, Jimmy Rollins said, "This year has been tougher."
</P>
<P>
And so after Ryan Howard tagged the first-base bag, the Phillies
mobbed one another. Most players returned to the field to rejoice
with friends, family and the fans, and in a poignant moment a large
group went to the sign in left-center field honoring the longtime
broadcaster Harry Kalas, who died April 13. They poured beer and
Champagne on it, and in Kalas' honor several smoked cigars.
</P>
<P>
The Phillies officially secured the division championship just a
minute or so before their game ended, when the Marlins defeated the
Braves, 5-4, in Atlanta. But that score was not displayed on the
scoreboard until after the Phillies had won.
</P>
<P>
At 92-66, the Phillies own the second-best record in the NL and
would begin their title defense at home next Wednesday as long as
they finish no worse than tied with St. Louis. Because they won the
season series with the Cardinals (90-68), the Phillies would earn
home-field advantage in the first round should the teams finish
with the same record.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully," Shane Victorino said, "This is the first of many
celebrations."

MAD ABOUT MEDFORD N.Y. MAKE NOTE OF BLOOMBERG CONTENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lady named Joyce Purnick has written a biography of Mike
Bloomberg, the
mayor of New York who grew up in Medford, and given that Bloomberg
cooperated with her, we can assume all those nice things he's said
about
Meffa were strictly for local consumption.
</P>
<P>
Chapter 2 is titled "Escape from Medford," which makes it
sound like a
swamp. Medford was simply not big enough to accommodate the
ambition of a
man who would become a billionaire and mayor of the greatest city
in the
world.
</P>
<P>
But, then, how many places compare with the Big Apple?
</P>
<P>
According to the book, Boston was "an isolating hour away"
from Medford
before Interstate 93 was built.
</P>
<P>
Which I suppose is true if you rode in on a snail.
</P>
<P>
With bricks in your pockets.
</P>
<P>
The killer quote is not from Bloomberg, presumably because he
was too
shrewd to say anything as crass, but from another Medford native,
Paul
Theroux, the writer, who was a year ahead of Bloomberg at Medford
High.
</P>
<P>
"It was not a bad place, but a place you want to leave, to
escape from,"
said Theroux. "I thought it would be death to stay there, that I
would
just be swallowed up. It was all right to grow up there, but to
stay there?
Fatal."
</P>
<P>
Let's leave aside for the moment that Paul Theroux somehow
managed to pick
up an English accent somewhere between West Medford and the West
End in
London, where he once lived. If Theroux is correct, the Browns must
be
immortal, because Larry Brown is the second generation to stay in
Medford,
and he's still breathing.
</P>
<P>
Larry Brown is 47 years old. He went to Holy Cross, joined the
Marines,
and now works in finance.
</P>
<P>
"I've been to the Far East, Down Under, across the pond, and,
no, that
doesn't mean Revere, the Cape, and Stoneham," he said. "I've been
to
every major American city, and many minor ones, but I very
consciously
decided to stay here and raise my kids in Medford.
</P>
<P>
"I've always said it was a great mix of collar and color. It's
blue
collar and white collar. You've got white folks, black, Asian,
Latino. You
name it. My neighbors are a consultant, an electrician, a
firefighter, an
operating engineer, a music teacher, a house painter. I love that
there's
no pretense to the city or its people."
</P>
<P>
Meaning, no one walks around Medford Square spouting an affected
English
accent.
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a committee trying to fix every little thing,"
Larry Brown
said. "You can attend a parent-teacher night and run into someone
you
haven't seen in 30 years and both laugh that the hard-nosed
administrator
at the school was a teacher back then."
</P>
<P>
There are 11 people running for six School Committee seats in
Medford.
Larry Brown, political neophyte, is one of them.
</P>
<P>
"There was a guy on the School Committee for years, Freddie
Pompeo.
Freddie's 91. He was a prisoner of war. A great guy. He's stepping
down
after 60 years of public service, and I thought, 'Why not?' Time to
give
back. I love the city. I've got two sons in the schools. I'm new to
all
this, but what's struck me when I knock on doors is how many people
thank
me for running.
</P>
<P>
"Medford isn't perfect, doesn't try to be, and laughs wicked
hard at
people who think they are," Larry Brown said. "And the kicker?
Mayor
Bloomberg's mother gets her nails done at the same place my mother
does."
</P>
<P>
This fact was confirmed Wednesday by the beautiful Charlotte
Bloomberg,
who is 100 years old, still lives on Ronaele Road, and still has
her
fastball. Her son, the big shot, remains dutiful. He visited her
two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
She loves her son, but she's not going to bat for Paul Theroux.
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who think there's always something
better
someplace else," Charlotte Bloomberg said. "I think Medford is a
great
place to live."

WHY NOT BELIEVE? THE CASE FOR GOD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(Alfred A. Knopf; 411 pages; $27.95)

      Reviewed by Don Lattin

<P>
Karen Armstrong has written another big book about the various
ways people throughout history and across cultures envision and
explain what they can neither see nor understand.
</P>
<P>
This new work by the prolific British author is titled "The
Case for God." It takes 411 pages to argue that the postmodern
believer must find a theology of silence, a catechism beyond words.
</P>
<P>
Her message inspires this advice for time-pressed readers who'd
like to practice what Armstrong preaches:
</P>
<P>
Read the introduction, then skip to the final chapter. Make sure
you read the Epilogue, but don't worry too much about those 289
pages in between.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who attracted a loyal following with her 1993
best-seller "A History of God," is a brilliant woman and engaging
commentator on the philosophical and theological foundations of the
world's religions. But she has an annoying tendency to explain the
history of everything every time she wants to make a point.
</P>
<P>
Her point here is a well-reasoned response to the so-called
"new atheists," a trio of anti-religionists (Richard Dawkins, Sam
Harris and Christopher Hitchens) who surprised the publishing world
with their own series of best-selling books.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong rightly points out that these writers have committed
literary sins -- not so much with their disbelief in God -- but in
the way they seek to discredit all people of faith by focusing on
the intolerant and sometimes violent message promoted by Muslim,
Christian and Jewish fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
In the process, Armstrong argues, Dawkins, Harris and Hitchens
are guilty of the same narrow-mindedness that they seek to expose.
"Like all religious fundamentalists," she writes, "the new
atheists believe that they alone are in possession of truth; like
Christian fundamentalists, they read scripture in an entirely
literal manner."
</P>
<P>
This former nun and author of 18 other books on religious themes
outdoes the new atheists with her own critique of contemporary
religious fundamentalism. "It is essential for critics of religion
to see fundamentalism in historic context," she writes. "Far from
being typical of faith, it is an aberration."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong does not just go after the easy targets -- the Osama
bin Ladens and Jerry Falwells of the world. Nor does she avoid the
obvious horrors of Christendom -- the Crusades, the Inquisition and
the wars of religion. She recounts that bloody horror, but
continues with a subtler analysis of the way modern theologians
sought to rationalize the divine in the wake of the Reformation,
the Enlightenment and the scientific revolution.
</P>
<P>
Philosophers who mistakenly predicted "the death of God" were
dead wrong in that prophecy, but they did seriously injure the
Almighty by turning divinity into "a purely notional truth
attainable by the rational and scientific intellect, without
ritual, prayer or ethical commitment."
</P>
<P>
"Religion was never supposed to provide answers to questions
that lay within the reach of human reason," Armstrong concludes.
"Religion's task, closely allied to that of art, was to help us
live creatively, peacefully, and even joyfully with realities for
which there were no easy explanations."
</P>
<P>
This is not an easy task. True religion "requires a great deal
of effort and cannot succeed if it is facile, false, idolatrous, or
self-indulgent."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong does uncover a few gems in her lucid but sometimes
tiring recitation of the entire history of Greek philosophy, Jewish
mysticism, Christian theology and Muslim thought.
</P>
<P>
One of them was a sixth century Syrian mystic who used the
pseudonym Dionysius the Areopagite, who was St. Paul's first
Athenian convert. Here was a Christian writer who appreciated the
value of silence and a different kind of knowledge -- an
"unknowing" that "drives us out of ourselves."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong writes that Pseudo-Dionysius understood "the inherent
finitude of language," and ends her book with the suggestion that
"it is perhaps time to return to a theology that asserts less and
is more open to silence and unknowing."
</P>
<P>
Let's err on the side of praise, and find mystical paradox in
the way Armstrong takes so many words to get us to a truth beyond
words. For, in the end, "The Case for God" sounds an enlightened
call for people of faith -- and people of no faith -- to follow a
middle path between mindless fundamentalism and rigid atheism.

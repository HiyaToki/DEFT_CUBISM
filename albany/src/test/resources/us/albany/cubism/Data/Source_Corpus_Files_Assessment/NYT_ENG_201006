' JOAN RIVERS: A PIECE OF WORK ' : A COMEDIAN ' S LIFE: ENTER TALKING OR MOCKING
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joan Rivers -- where have you been all my life? That, at least,
is what I thought after watching (twice) the documentary "Joan
Rivers: A Piece of Work." Directed by Ricki Stern and Annie
Sundberg, this convulsively funny movie takes an up-close and
sometimes queasy-personal approach to its motormouth subject, who,
when she's not making you howl with laughter (or freeze up in
horror), brandishes her deeply held hurts, fears, prejudices, poor
judgment and bad taste as if they were stigmata.
</P>
<P>
Once best known as Johnny Carson's permanent guest host (until
he cut her dead) and for her disingenuous question "Can we talk?"
(not you, silly), Rivers, now 77, began slipping down the
pop-culture food chain in the 1980s after a series of calamities,
including the 1987 suicide of her husband, Edgar Rosenberg. She
continued to perform and to churn out books, among other pursuits.
But for those who didn't know her way back when, she was little
more than a red-carpet attack dog and plastic-surgery cautionary
tale. She made you laugh (and cringe), but there was desperation in
the sight of this former comedy savant who, between operations and
peddling jewelry on QVC lashed out at those whose celebrity
eclipsed hers.
</P>
<P>
Whatever else you want to call her -- and various names spring to
mind while watching the movie -- she seems an unlikely fit for Stern
and Sundberg, whose documentaries include "The Devil Came on
Horseback," about the atrocities in Darfur, and "The Trials of
Darryl Hunt," about a wrongly convicted African-American prisoner.
However improbable, the match-up works, partly because the
filmmakers don't approach her as either an entertainment industry
untouchable or one of its casualties.
</P>
<P>
They're sympathetic to her, but a touch cool, and certainly not
fawning, which underscores their status as entertainment industry
outsiders. This is just a look at a native in her natural habitat,
sequins and feathered boas included.
</P>
<P>
The filmmakers probably didn't need to force their way into that
habitat, because Rivers, who, with her daughter, Melissa, starred
in a television movie about her husband's death, seems to have few
boundaries. It isn't that she over-shares on an obvious level --
there are many biographical details that never even come up -- it's
that no other "Joan," no private self, seems to be lurking
beneath the mask. Given the single-mindedness with which she
pursues her career -- Melissa Rivers likens that career to a second
child -- you have to wonder how any other Joan could have survived.
It's no wonder that when Joan Rivers asks a radio host, "Who is
the real me?" it feels like an honest question.
</P>
<P>
For 14 months Stern and Sundberg tagged along with their
subject, racking up miles and yowzah moments in her relentless
pursuit of fame, money, attention, love, kicks, masochistic thrills
or whatever it is that makes Rivers, nee Joan Alexandra Molinsky,
run. Having lucked out with timing, they began shooting in 2008,
the year before Rivers won the Donald Trump reality show "The
Celebrity Apprentice." She was enduring a fallow period and
fighting irrelevance any which way she could, which might account
for why she agreed to this documentary. (She's also good friends
with Stern's mother.) The filmmakers kept after her as she moved
from airplanes to hotel lobbies, dressing rooms and onto the stage,
where her cavernously wide mouth pours out invective, acid asides
and jokes jokes jokes like water.
</P>
<P>
To their credit, the filmmakers don't try to make her look good,
and while they omit some of her uglier routines, they don't
(perhaps can't) ask you to love her. That's a wise move.
</P>
<P>
Rivers may be a comic genius, but she's easier to admire from
the distance of a movie seat and perhaps across the passage of
time. An equal-opportunity offender, she has taken plenty of people
down on her way up, including other women. Watching some of her
nastier "Tonight Show" spots (which aren't in the movie), I find
it hard to decide if her pokes at Elizabeth Taylor's weight are
more painful than her self-lacerating gibes. Picking on Taylor was
unspeakably mean. But Rivers' contempt for herself lasted longer: a
lifetime, or so it seems.
</P>
<P>
Smartly, the filmmakers take on Rivers' own looks from the
start, opening the movie with shots of her bare face -- a shut naked
eye, a thin line of mouth -- as someone else greases it with makeup.
It's only after she's put on this face that all these pieces come
together in startling close-up. It's a nice metaphor for the effort
it takes to assemble the product known as Joan Rivers, but the
bluntness of the images and her gaze are disconcerting. Is she
daring us to look, or begging? It's hard to know, and the
filmmakers, who resist putting her on the couch, aren't saying. In
the end, all you really know is that when she stands on the stage,
it's as if she had tapped right into her id. It's a gusher.
</P>
<P>
"Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work" is rated R. (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian.) Her language is so dirty
that it's almost charming, when it's not appalling.

<P>
VILCABAMBA - I've barely stepped off the plane when the stories
about the
Valle de Longevidad - Valley of Longevity - start. My cabdriver
asks what
I'm doing in this small town in southern Ecuador, and I tell him
I'm in
search of the legendary old people of Vilcabamba. The cabbie
brightens.
"My great-great uncle lived to be 127 years old," he says. "His
name was
Miguel Carpio."
</P>
<P>
Everyone in Vilcabamba knew Carpio. And it seems like half the
town is
related to him. Some say he was 127. Some say 130. Some say he
wasn't a day
over 110.
</P>
<P>
I've come here to ferret out truth from myth: Does this
off-the-beaten-path place really have some sort of magic charm,
where
centenarians are the norm? Or is it mostly legend, started a
generation ago
by an article in National Geographic magazine and picked up by
locals eager
to promote tourism?
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s Dr. Alexander Leaf visited three places known
for
longevity, all remote and mountainous: a village in Kashmir,
another in the
Russian Caucasus, and Vilcabamba. Leaf, then a professor at Harvard
and
chief of medical services at Massachusetts General Hospital, wrote
that in
1971, Vilcabamba, with a population of 819, had nine people older
than 100.
In comparison, the United States had three centenarians per 100,000
people.
</P>
<P>
According to Leaf, a doctor in Quito had studied the diets of
the elderly
in Vilcabamba and concluded that they took in about 1,200 calories
a day,
low in fat and cholesterol, which would minimize heart disease. In
addition, physical activity required by living in a high altitude
improved
their cardiopulmonary function.
</P>
<P>
And then there was the genetic component. Many of the
uber-elderly Leaf
spoke to had a long-lived sibling or parent. In an isolated village
where
many are interrelated, Leaf speculated that a few people lacking
"bad
genes" that increase morbidity might have been the source of the
longevity.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 years later, Vilcabamba has grown to 5,000
inhabitants. It was
connected to the larger world 30 years ago by a winding, two-lane
highway.
But it is still a sleepy town with a square anchored by the
requisite
church. In a nod to tourism, some restaurants, spas, and excursion
agencies
have sprung up on the surrounding streets. There are outfitters who
lead
hikes or horseback rides into the nearby Podocarpus National Park
with its
350,000 acres, lakes, waterfalls and streams, and abundant plant
and animal
life.
</P>
<P>
At 5,000 feet, Vilcabamba lies in the shadow of the Andes with
views of
lush valleys and distant purple slopes. With an average temperature
of 78
degrees, the town enjoys eternal spring. Everything grows here:
orange,
lemon, and lime groves, sugar cane, banana trees, and flowers of
all hues.
</P>
<P>
But what about the old folks?
</P>
<P>
My cabbie, Fabricio Peralta, is eager to help me on my mission.
"It's the
water, the air, the food they grow," he offers. Vilcabamba, he
boasts, was
organic before anyone knew what that meant. The old-timers have
always
eaten what they grow, nothing out of a can or box, and no
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
"The grandmas make this horchata tea with eight or 10 medicinal
herbs they
grow," says Peralta. "They drink this kind of tea every
morning."
</P>
<P>
The alleged fountain of youth could indeed be something in the
drinking
water. Highly mineralized, from pristine mountain springs, the
water is
bottled and sold in stores. Labels on the Vilcagua spring water
bear the
likeness of a robust elderly man. The same sort of logo adorns the
sides of
the town's taxis.
</P>
<P>
Judy Meumunier moved here a year ago from Indianapolis after
reading about
the town on the Internet. "It's been the best year of my life,"
says the
retired real estate broker. "The weather, the scenery, the people
- I just
love it all."
</P>
<P>
Does she see a lot of old people? "Yes, they're pretty amazing.
My
cabdriver told me his relative lived to be 127."
</P>
<P>
Hmmm. Sounds familiar. My cabbie directs me to the town park,
where I find
Nesto Carpio, son of the late, legendary Miguel, "who spent only
one night
in 127 years in the hospital, his last night on earth."
</P>
<P>
But Nesto is a youthful 92 and only retired a year ago from
farming beans,
coffee, and maize. He wears thick glasses but says he feels fine
and is on
no medications. "It's the food, the good water, and air," he
adds.
</P>
<P>
At the local hospital, Dr. Juan Espinoza says there's something
to that.
"The old people, they eat natural food that they grow, they walk a
lot,
they work. They're strong." And, he says, "They're active
sexually."
</P>
<P>
Another Carpio - Victor, the hospital pharmacist - has published
a magazine
devoted to the super-elderly of Vilcabamba. With about a dozen
subjects,
most of them hovering around 100, Carpio writes that though they
may look
old they are strong and agile, many of them still working.
</P>
<P>
He tells me about Vincente Pilco Torres, who will be 110 -
allegedly - in
August, and says he's the town's oldest resident. His only problem?
He's
hard of hearing.
</P>
<P>
I can't locate Torres, but I find Manuel Picoita, allegedly 105,
sitting on
the steps of a disheveled house shared by four generations. The
extended
family, which honors the elderly, is another reason given for the
longevity. A nursing home would be unheard of.
</P>
<P>
Picoita seems happy. Pointing to his eyes and then his ears, he
says: "I
can see, I can hear." From age 12, he worked in the fields, from 6
a.m.
until 6 p.m. He still works, but "a little slower." He laughs,
revealing
few teeth. "I'd like to live 20 years more."
</P>
<P>
There are four generations living in the home of Lucila
Victorios Guerrero,
who is said to be 104: Guerrero, her daughter, granddaughter, and
great-grandson. Though her hearing is perfect, her eyes are not,
and she
walks with a cane. For decades, she worked as a seamstress. She
gets up
daily at 4 a.m. and starts breakfast for the family. She drinks
coffee "to
give me strength" and goes to church every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There's another theory about the "longevos": Maybe they are
lying about
their age. They don't have driver's licenses or birth certificates.
(But
there's one glitch in this hypothesis: since when do women lie to
make
themselves older?)
</P>
<P>
In my strolls around town, I don't see an abundance of old
people. Peralta
often has tourists like me ask him where all the old folks are. "I
tell
them they're out in the fields working, not lazy like you."
</P>
<P>
Still, I'm not convinced that there are more centenarians in
Vilcabamba
than elsewhere. But as word of the valley's fabled longevity has
spread,
visitors have flocked here.
</P>
<P>
"There's still a lot of healthy longevity here," says Brian
O'Leary, a
former MIT-educated astronaut and author who moved to Vilcabamba
with his
artist wife six years ago. "However, the gringo 'invasion' does
offer more
temptations such as processed food that is making the tradition
shrink."
</P>
<P>
Several of the "viejos" have died in recent years, and the
younger
generations are unlikely to live as long, says Espinoza, who is
seeing more
diabetes and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
Richard Fontes, a Brazil native who moved to the United States
as a
teenager, has lived in Vilcabamba for nearly 20 years. He came to
town,
commissioned by a Miami doctor to look into "this longevity
thing." When
he arrived, there were few cars; people tied horses or donkeys to
posts in
town.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to know about the food they eat, the water they
drink, are they
sexually active, how do they take care of themselves when they're
sick?"
says Fontes.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that before the highway was built, in 1982, there
was a high
percentage of centenarians. "You had a small valley with all the
natural
elements, a small gene pool with longevity genes in there."
</P>
<P>
Each family, he says, had its own garden and grew herbs for
horchata tea.
"It's a blood cleanser, a kidney cleanser. It's medicinal and they
drank
it all the time. Now, you have Coke, you have Fanta, and alcohol is
rampant."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the last five years have brought construction of
hotels, more
cars, and microwave towers for cellphones, he says. Fontes ran a
health
food store for awhile, but "nobody was interested."
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's looking for a magic bullet," he says, "but there
ain't no
magic bullet."
</P>
<P>
Fontes, who nevertheless loves Vilcabamba, concludes: "They
ought to just
sell it for what it is, a great place to live, with great water and
a great
climate. And you can get a great house for $70,000."
</P>
<P>
When I get back from Ecuador, I decide to see if Leaf, who wrote
the
original National Geographic story, is available for comment. He
is. At 90,
he still goes to the office every afternoon to research the effects
of fish
oil and fatty acids on longevity.
</P>
<P>
So, how does he feel about the longevos 40 years later?
"Grossly
exaggerated," he now says. "None of them were nearly as old as
they
claimed. They do grow old and remain active, but I'm 90 and I'm
still
active, too."
</P>
<P>
Still, I'm drinking lots of horchata tea I bought in Vilcabamba.
You never
know.

RWANDA TRIBUNAL LAWYERS VOICE WORRIES JEFFREY GETTLEMAN CONTRIBUTED REPORTING FROM NAIROBI, KENYA.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KAMPALA, Uganda
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense lawyers at the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda, which has been prosecuting ringleaders of the
1994 genocide, are threatening to stop participating in cases after
one of their colleagues was jailed by the Rwandan government last
month.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of lawyers contend that Peter Erlinder, an
American who represents a senior Rwandan Army officer accused of
directing death squads, was arrested for his statements at the
tribunal even though he is supposed to be protected by diplomatic
immunity while working for it.
</P>
<P>
Erlinder, 62, is charged with denying Rwanda's genocide and
threatening national security through his writings and speeches.
Rwanda's government argues that Erlinder's work can "instigate
riots" and "civil disobediences," but it seems that many of the
statements that the Rwandan government finds objectionable are
actually part of Erlinder's work as a lawyer in the United States
and in Arusha, Tanzania, where the United Nations-backed tribunal
for Rwanda is based.
</P>
<P>
So far, 11 lawyers with imminent court appearances have formally
requested that the courts postpone their cases. At least 40 in
total -- a majority of the defense lawyers working for the tribunal
-- have signed a general petition saying they plan not to work
unless their security can be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the tribunal say that they doubt that the
lawyers, who are paid by the United Nations, would pull out, but
that the tribunal's proceedings would be prolonged if that
happened. Lawyers would be held in contempt -- one already has been
-- and could face years in jail for withdrawing without court
approval.
</P>
<P>
Despite assurances from Rwanda that Erlinder was not arrested
for his work at the tribunal, officials at the tribunal say they
also believe there is a connection. They have asked Rwanda for
clarification and may bring the case in front of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
"ICTR will not allow anyone to be prosecuted for the work that
it has done for it," said the tribunal's spokesman, Roland
Amoussouga.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda says the protesting lawyers are creating "deliberate
confusion," and that while it is understandable to care for a
colleague, their claims are "outrageous" and "false."
</P>
<P>
"Defense lawyers at ICTR have a job to do, and the government
of Rwanda understands that," said a government spokeswoman, Louise
Mushikiwabo.
</P>
<P>
But she said the criminal case against Erlinder is about "his
role as a denier, a propagator and a mobilizer of people who
diminish, distort, deny the extermination of a million Tutsi of
this country."
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time there have been tensions between
Rwanda and the U.N. tribunal. The Rwandan government was lukewarm
about the court being established in the first place, citing
sovereignty and the international community's inaction during the
genocide. Since then, the Rwandans have been upset about the
court's sluggishness -- only 50 trials have been completed in more
than 15 years, with 42 convictions. Last year, Rwanda threatened to
stop sending witnesses to Arusha after the acquittal of two leading
suspects.
</P>
<P>
Differences have also grown over how wide a net the court should
cast. Rwanda stopped sending witnesses to the tribunal in 2002
after the tribunal considered prosecuting possible crimes against
humanity committed by Rwanda's governing party, and the courts
virtually ground to a halt. The tribunal relented later in the
year, and a new prosecutor was appointed in 2003.
</P>
<P>
As Rwanda gears up for a presidential election in August,
political tensions are rising. Erlinder was arrested after going to
Rwanda to represent an opposition candidate, who was charged with
espousing "genocide ideology" when she spoke out about atrocities
that she said may have been committed by the governing party and
have been overlooked.
</P>
<P>
The charges against Erlinder may stem from claims he made at the
tribunal, where he argued that the members of the current
government shot down a plane carrying the presidents of Rwanda and
Burundi, spontaneously setting off the genocide. Rwanda has
published a report saying the former government was responsible,
and many historians concur.
</P>
<P>
According to Rwanda's prosecution, Erlinder is guilty of denying
the genocide because he has implied that the genocide was not
planned. The prosecution cited a lawsuit he filed in Oklahoma on
behalf of the widows of the two former presidents, and it also
cited a 2008 trial at the tribunal in which they say Erlinder
"downplayed genocide."
</P>
<P>
He is currently awaiting trial at the central prison in Kigali,
Rwanda's capital. His daughter says that he has not been able to
speak to his family and that his health has taken a turn for the
worse. She says her father was admitted to a Kigali hospital on
Wednesday for the third time since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers in Arusha worry that Rwanda's laws, which
critics say are intentionally vague, could be used against them,
too.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to resign; I want the ICTR to guarantee our
rights," said Frederic Weyl, a French defense attorney who filed a
second appeal for postponement this week. Weyl said that because of
remarks he made during a legal conference in Paris in 2002 about
the rights of the accused to question charges, the Rwandan
government considered him a "negationist."
</P>
<P>
"If I had a mission to Kigali, perhaps I can be in the same
situation as Erlinder," he said.

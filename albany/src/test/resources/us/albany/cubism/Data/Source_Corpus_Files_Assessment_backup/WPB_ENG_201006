The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post:
</P>

Ken Cuccinelli, Virginia's attorney general, is not famously a champion of the
First Amendment. As a state lawmaker, he sought to subvert it with legislation
that would bar journalists from knocking on the doors of bereaved families. His
colleagues in the General Assembly turned a deaf ear to that measure, and with
good reason.
</P>
<P>
Now comes another, more agonizing case involving bereaved families, the First
Amendment and Cuccinelli. In this instance, he was asked to join a lawsuit,
brought by the family of a Marine killed in Iraq, against a group of hateful
religious zealots who picket service members' funerals. The picketers contend
that American combat deaths are to be celebrated as God's punishment for
America's tolerance of homosexuals. The case is to be heard by the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
Cuccinelli refused to lend Virginia's support to the lawsuit. In taking that
stand, he pitted Virginia against 48 other states that have joined it,
effectively sided with a handful of gay-bashing provocateurs over the mourning
family of a dead Marine who wanted to bury their son in peace, triggered bitter
criticism _ and stood up for the First Amendment. Although Cuccinelli's legal
judgments often seem clouded by his conservative ideological agenda, in this
case he has made a good call, albeit an unpopular one.
</P>
<P>
It would be difficult to find a more loathsome band than Westboro Baptist Church
of Topeka, Kan., whose sparse congregation mounts small but vocal protests at
military funerals, schools and other venues around the country. The church _
better described as an extended family cult led by its patriarch, one Fred W.
Phelps _ deploys its members, some of whom drag the American flag on the ground,
with signs praising God for dead soldiers, improvised explosive devices and the
attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The family of Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder, killed in action in Iraq, sued
Phelps and the church, arguing that by picketing the funeral they had caused the
family emotional distress, interfered with its privacy and abridged its rights
to free exercise of religion and peaceful assembly.
</P>
<P>
Some of Cuccinelli's critics have noted that the right to free speech can be
legitimately restricted, as in Oliver Wendell Holmes' famous example of falsely
shouting fire in a crowded theater. But restrictions that safeguard public
safety should not be wielded to stifle public speech, no matter how inflammatory
or hurtful. The sensible way to deal with Phelps and his followers is by using
the same regulations the authorities generally use to contain other obnoxious
groups of protesters _ racists, neo-Nazis, skinheads. Keep them at a distance
from which they cannot disrupt their targets, provide adequate police presence
to deter violence, and let them spew. That approach ensures that in the free
marketplace of ideas, their hate speech will fall on deaf ears.

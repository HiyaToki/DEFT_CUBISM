Sarkozy lauds British PM ahead of election

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French President Nicolas Sarkozy showered praise on British Prime Minister
Gordon Brown Friday weeks before a general election here, but rebuked Brown's
main rival over his policy in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy said after talks in London that Brown was a "great reformer" and someone
who was "willing to get things moving".
</P>
<P>
The centre-right president said that although Brown was from the other side of
the fence politically -- he leads the centre-left Labour Party -- they were able
to discuss issues frankly "even if we don't always agree".
</P>
<P>
The president was later Friday to meet David Cameron, the leader of the centre-
right Conservatives who are more 'natural' political partners for Sarkozy's
party.
</P>
<P>
But he criticised Cameron's decision to withdraw the Conservatives from the main
centre-right grouping in the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Cameron could become prime minister if the Conservatives win an election widely
expected to take place on May 6, although opinion polls show their long-
comfortable lead over Labour has dwindled sharply in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy insisted he had not come to Britain to "play politics" by visiting so
close to the election.
</P>
<P>
However, his insistence that Britain must be "right in the heart" of Europe
appeared to be aimed at Cameron, who last year pulled the Conservatives out of
the European People's Party (EPP) to align with a group of small parties.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy's party and that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel belong to the EPP.
</P>
<P>
"If you want to me to say that I regret his (Cameron's) decision on the EPP, my
answer is yes," Sarkozy said.
</P>
<P>
In other comments he slammed the United States over changes to bidding rules for
a tanker jet contract, saying it was "not the way" for Washington to treat its
European allies.
</P>
<P>
Brown added he was "disappointed" at the way the rules had been altered to
favour US aerospace giant Boeing, which is poised to win a 35 billion dollar (26
billion euro) deal to build aerial refueling planes for the US air force.
</P>
<P>
"I admit that I did not appreciate this decision," Sarkozy adding: "I don't like
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
"These are methods which are not good for the partners of the United States,
which is a great nation with which we are close, and friends," he added.
</P>
<P>
Northrop and European partner EADS dropped their joint offer amid European
allegations that the Pentagon altered bidding rules for the contract in order to
favour Boeing's all-American offer over the European bid.
</P>
<P>
Turning to efforts to avoid a repetition of the global economic crisis, the
president said France, Britain and their European partners were seeking to find
a "balance" on regulating hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy said he remained convinced that the highly speculative funds "bore a
heavy responsibility" for the crisis, and that they need to be regulated.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the main European centre for hedge funds, is concerned that draft EU
directives to introduce tighter regulation could throw up new barriers to
business.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Sarkozy snapped at a question about recent rumours concerning his
private life, dismissing the speculation as "ravings" and saying he had no time
to waste on them.
</P>
<P>
"You must be unaware what a president of the Republic's diary is like, but I
don't have a second, or even half a second, to waste on these ravings," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I wonder why you use your speaking time to ask such a question," he rebuked the
French journalist.

Formula One: Sydney bid to snatch Aussie GP from Melbourne

Sydney, March 27, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sydney authorities on Saturday laid out plans to lure the Australian Grand Prix
from "arrogant" Melbourne, sparking a fierce spat between the rival cities.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney-based New South Wales state government said initial costings were
already underway for hosting a night race, most likely at 2000 Olympic site
Homebush, from 2015.
</P>
<P>
"I've already started to make contact with the F1 promoters, we're already
having a good look at the facilities and infrastructure that we have available
for such an event," said major events minister Ian MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
"They can rest assured down in Melbourne that they're going to have a hard time,
they haven't got this event to themselves.
</P>
<P>
"They're complacent, they're somewhat arrogant and we believe we can offer a
night grand prix, which is something the promoters we know need to service their
European viewership."
</P>
<P>
His Melbourne counterpart Tim Holding responded angrily to the announcement,
calling the New South Wales authority "the nation's biggest blowhards".
</P>
<P>
Melbourne has hosted the Australian Grand Prix since taking over from Adelaide
in 1996, but the event has come into question due to its high cost to local
taxpayers.

Russia slams Georgian TV hoax as 'paranoia'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Moscow, March 15, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russia slammed as irresponsible and paranoid a faked Georgian television report
of a Russian invasion, saying the broadcast had further heightened instability
in the tense Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
"The actions of Imedi (television channel) were irresponsible and immoral,"
foreign ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko said in a statement, calling on the
international community to condemn the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
"Political paranoia has never had a positive affect," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nesterenko accused Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili of giving his go-ahead
to the programme that sparked panic in the post-Soviet state after it aired
Saturday night on Imedi showing Russian tanks headed for Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
"The Georgian president has not hid his approval of the scandalous programme,
whose scenario he dubbed as close to the reality as possible," the statement
posted on the ministry's website said.
</P>
<P>
"The provocative broadcast has had a negative effect on security and stability
in the region," Nesterenko said.
</P>
<P>
Saakashvili appeared Sunday to defend the broadcast, saying it was "extremely
close to what can happen and to what Georgia's enemy has conceived."
</P>
<P>
Imedi used footage taken from the August 2008 war that saw Russian forces pour
into Georgia and bomb targets across the country. It said Saakashvili had been
killed and some opposition leaders had sided with invading Russian forces.

RugbyL: Senior charged over World Club ref rant
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LEEDS, England, March 3, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leeds centre Keith Senior was charged by the Rugby Football League with a rule
breach after slamming the performance of referee Richard Silverwood in the
Rhinos' World Club Challenge loss.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old former Great Britain international labelled Silverwood
"arrogant" after he was penalised by him for dissent during the Super League
champions' 18-10 defeat by Melbourne Storm at Elland Road on Sunday, although he
later apologised for the comments.
</P>
<P>
"Referees make mistakes but it's the manner in which they do it. We've been with
him many times and he is just arrogant," Senior said of Silverwood.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of players don't like him because it's not about the occasion with him.
He always wants to be the centre of attention."
</P>
<P>
Last season Hull KR coach Justin Morgan was fined 4,000 pounds - half of it
suspended - after he was found guilty of breaching the Rugby Football League's
'Respect' policy for labelling referee Ben Thaler "sub-standard".
</P>
<P>
Senior, who was angered over what he saw as Silverwood's failure to clamp down
on Melbourne's "spoiling " tactics at the play-the-ball, apologised later Sunday
for his remarks.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to apologise for any offence caused by my comments following our
defeat to Melbourne," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately I let my emotions get the better of me after a physically and
mentally draining clash with Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"Having had time to reflect on my comments, I appreciate that, like us players,
referees have a difficult job to do and we do not have a game without them."

China lashes out at US House resolution on Falungong
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Beijing, March 18, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China on Thursday lashed out at a US House of Representatives resolution that
urged Beijing to end its "persecution" of the outlawed Falungong spiritual
group.
</P>
<P>
"The US House of Representatives passed a so-called resolution on Falungong
which made groundless accusations and confuses right and wrong," foreign
ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"China is firmly against such a resolution."
</P>
<P>
The House voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to call on China to free thousands
of members of the movement who are said to be imprisoned and to abolish a
government office tasked with fighting the Falungong.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which is not legally binding, asked China to "immediately cease
and desist from its campaign to persecute, intimidate, imprison and torture
Falungong practitioners."
</P>
<P>
Falungong -- loosely based on Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian philosophies --
enjoyed growing popularity among Chinese in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
China's communist government banned the movement in 1999 and later branded it an
"evil cult" after thousands of practitioners silently converged in Beijing to
air their grievances, showing their organisational might.
</P>
<P>
"Falungong is an anti-human, anti-society and anti-science cult," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government outlawed the cult according to law. We hope the US
congressmen recognise the nature of the cult and stop interfering in China's
internal affairs."

US House presses China on Falungong

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US House of Representatives on Tuesday urged China to end its "persecution"
of the Falungong and rejected Beijing's charges that the banned spiritual
movement is an "evil cult."
</P>
<P>
In a nearly unanimous vote, the House called on China to free thousands of
practitioners who are said to be imprisoned and to abolish an office tasked with
fighting the Falungong.
</P>
<P>
The House expressed "sympathy to Falungong practitioners and their family
members who have suffered persecution, intimidation, imprisonment, torture and
even death for the past decade solely because of adherence to their personal
beliefs."
</P>
<P>
The resolution asked China to "immediately cease and desist from its campaign to
persecute, intimidate, imprison and torture Falungong practitioners."
</P>
<P>
The measure expresses the sense of lawmakers but is not binding on Washington
policymakers. China has bristled at previous resolutions on its human rights
record, calling it interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Falungong -- a movement loosely based on Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian
philosophies that features spiritual exercises -- enjoyed growing popularity
among Chinese in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
China's communist government banned the movement in 1999 and later branded it an
"evil cult" after thousands of practitioners silently converged in Beijing to
air their grievances, showing their organizational might.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese authorities have devoted extensive time and resources over the past
decade worldwide to distributing false propaganda claiming that Falungong is a
suicidal and militant 'evil cult' rather than a spiritual movement which draws
upon traditional Chinese concepts of meditation and exercise," the resolution
said.
</P>
<P>
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who led the legislation, called China's
treatment of the Falungong "one of the most flagrant examples of systematic
persecution against a particular group taking place in the world today."
</P>
<P>
"The Beijing regime of today engages in the barbaric repression of some of its
own people simply because they seek to practice a peaceful spiritual
discipline," said the Florida congresswoman, the top Republican on the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.

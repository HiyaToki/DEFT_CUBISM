NFL: Vick scores two touchdowns triumphant Atlanta return
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ATLANTA, Georgia, Dec 6, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former gridiron superstar Michael Vick scored his first touchdowns since
returning to the National Football League after a jail term against his former
club here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Vick scored on a five-yard run in the third quarter and threw a five-yard
touchdown pass in the fourth quarter for Philadelphia in a 34-7 victory at
Atlanta, drawing cheers from the same crowd that had welcomed him with boos.
</P>
<P>
"I can't be more thankful," Vick said. "I was overwhelmed by the crowd's
reaction. I'm so glad I had a second chance. It was awesome.
</P>
<P>
"I will never forget this day. This is one moment I'm going to savor forever."
</P>
<P>
It was the 11th time in Vick's career he ran and threw for a touchdown in the
same game but the first time he had found the end zone since his comeback from a
prison sentence for his role in a dogfight ring.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of Michael for going in and doing the things he did and keeping his
composure at an emotional time," Eagles coach Andy Reid said.
</P>
<P>
Vick has played a limited reserve role as a backup quarterback for the Eagles
this season after being released from federal prison for financing the canine
gambling operation.
</P>
<P>
Exposed details of animal cruelty by Vick - including slaying of dogs through
such methods as beating, drowning and electrocution - have brought an apology
and speeches to youth groups by Vick on not doing as he once did.
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to get the crowd on their feet and let them know I miss them too,"
Vick said. "I knew it would be 50-50. I totally understand."
</P>
<P>
Hurting Falcons fans who dreamed of a first-ever Super Bowl behind Vick's run-
pass skills took out their anger when he came onto the field, booing him on runs
of three and four yards for Philadelphia on the Eagles' first drive.
</P>
<P>
But in his first appearance of the second half in place of Eagles starter
Donovan McNabb, Vick received the ball on a direct long snap and ran up the
middle, diving into the end zone for his first touchdown since last scoring for
the Falcons on October 15, 2006.
</P>
<P>
"It was a great feeeling to get into the end zone. It was as if time stopped on
that play," Vick said. "When I scored that touchdown, the entire bench was
halfway onto the field (to congratulate me)."
</P>
<P>
Vick connected with Brent Celek on a five-yard touchdown pass with 2:29 elapsed
in the fourth quarter, completing an emotional return with the best day yet in
his comeback, prompting Falcon fans to chant "We want Vick."
</P>
<P>
"As loud as it gets in the stadium, it sent chills down my spine," Vick said.
"It was nice to hear that people are willing to give me a second chance."
</P>
<P>
Many spectators wore Vick's former Falcons jersey or new Eagles jersey, both
bearing the number seven, a tribute to a player who hopes to reverse the enmity
he aroused for his past actions.
</P>
<P>
"I want this to be an inspiring story," Vick said. "Things may happen but you
have to persevere, make strides week in and week out.
</P>
<P>
"I have the fortitude to more forward. That's what I want our youth to know,
that if they keep moving forward good things will happen. I'm going to keep
working until I become one of the best quarterbacks in the league again."
</P>
<P>
Former teammates greeted Vick warmly, including hugs from Todd McClure, his
former center with the Falcons, and Atlanta receiver Roddy White. Vick served as
a captain for the game and was on the field for the opening coin toss.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody felt it and rallied around him," Reid said. "Fans in general calling
out his name at the end there, I'm proud of them for giving him a second
chance."
</P>
<P>
Reid said he had no special advice for Vick on how to handle the homecoming, but
Vick revealed the coach had predicted Vick's two-touchdown performance.
</P>
<P>
"Patience is everything. Timing is everything," Vick said. "Andy told me at the
beginning of the week I was going to score two touchdowns. It couldn't have
happened at a better time. Who cares what happened in the past?"

Hamas stages mass rally in Gaza on 22nd anniversary
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Gaza City, Dec 14, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Hamas supporters waving green banners gathered in Gaza City
on Monday to mark the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Islamist group
that rules the isolated coastal strip.
</P>
<P>
Black-clad Hamas police had earlier sealed off roads leading to the rally, as
thousands of supporters were bused in from around the territory before making
their way to Gaza's Al-Kutaiba Square on foot.
</P>
<P>
Many carried portraits of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the wheelchair-bound cleric who
founded and led the group until he was killed in an Israeli air strike in 2004.
</P>
<P>
"In the 22 years since its founding, Hamas has been able to realise a large part
of its goals and to overcome every obstacle it has faced, from prison, exile,
assassinations and elections," senior Hamas leader Mahmud Zahar said.
</P>
<P>
"Our understanding of the resistance is total, and is not limited to armed
conflict," he added in an interview with a news website close to the smaller and
more radical Islamic Jihad faction.
</P>
<P>
Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas's armed wing the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades,
which was responsible for scores of deadly attacks and suicide bombings in
Israel, praised the group's military evolution.
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to build an army for resistance and to haunt the Zionist
enemy," he said in a statement on a Qassam-linked website.
</P>
<P>
"(The Qassam Brigades) has manufactured its weapons with its bare hands...
including the Qassam rocket, which terrifies the Zionist enemy," he added,
referring to the makeshift and rarely lethal rockets the group fired at Israel
before declaring a ceasefire after last winter's Gaza war.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1987 shortly after the beginning of the first intifada, or uprising,
against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Hamas was inspired
by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
The group remains pledged to the eventual destruction of Israel and the
establishment of an Islamic state on the pre-1948 borders of the British
Palestine Mandate.
</P>
<P>
Hamas won a landslide victory in Palestinian elections in 2006, routing the
long-dominant secular Fatah party led by the Western-backed president Mahmud
Abbas, and took over Gaza in June 2007 after months of factional unrest.
</P>
<P>
It has since tightened its grip on the territory despite harsh Israeli sanctions
imposed after the takeover and the devastating Gaza war at the turn of the year,
in which some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed.

Khamenei says US, Britain will fail to isolate Iran: TV
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tehran, Dec 6, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday the United States and
Britain who are Tehran's main "enemies" will fail to "isolate Iran" over its
nuclear issue, state television reported.
</P>
<P>
"Americans are at the head of the list of enemies and the British are the most
awful of them," Khamenei said, addressing thousands of people in a speech to
mark a major Shiite ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Americans, Zionists and other oppressive powers tried to isolate Iran for the
past 30 years, but they failed and with God's help they will also fail in the
future," state television quoted Khamenei as saying in reaction to sustained
Western threats to isolate Iran over its atomic programme.

BA travellers facing Christmas strike misery
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, Dec 14, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of British Airways passengers face travel misery over the
busy Christmas and New Year period after cabin crew voted Monday to strike over
job cuts and pay.
</P>
<P>
The industrial action comes at a critical point for loss-making British Airways,
which is slashing costs and attempting to merge with Spanish carrier Iberia in a
fight to stay competitive against its rivals.
</P>
<P>
"After long discussions... we are planning to withdraw our labour for a period
of 12 days starting 22nd December," Britain's biggest trade union Unite said in
a statement after staff voted 9-1 in favour of striking.
</P>
<P>
The announcement is a major blow for BA passengers that are planning to fly
worldwide with the British airline over the festive period to visit friends and
relatives. BA had carried 2.34 million passengers in November.
</P>
<P>
"We do not take the decision to strike lightly, especially during the financial
strife that the company finds itself in," Unite said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10,288 cabin crew voted with 92.49 percent in favour of strike
action.
</P>
<P>
The union complained that BA management were in a hurry to cut short-term costs
and were ignoring the longer-term impact on BA customers.
</P>
<P>
"The company is now in a head long rush to slash costs in the short term with no
regard to the long term effects this will have," Unite said.
</P>
<P>
BA fought back, slamming Unite's "cynical decision".
</P>
<P>
"British Airways is extremely disappointed that Unite is planning massive
disruption for hundreds of thousands of our customers over the Christmas/New
Year holiday period," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"A 12-day strike would be completely unjustified and a huge over-reaction to the
modest changes we have announced for cabin crew which are intended to help us
recover from record financial losses.
</P>
<P>
"Unite's cynical decision betrays a total lack of concern for our customers, our
business and other employees within British Airways."
</P>
<P>
BA last month revealed that net losses quadrupled to 217 million pounds in the
group's first half, or six months to September.
</P>
<P>
The airline had also announced it will cut an extra 1,200 jobs -- taking the
total planned reduction to 4,900 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of Monday's vote result, BA chief executive Willie Walsh had admitted that
he was bracing himself for "bad news".
</P>
<P>
BA also revealed Monday that its pension deficit had ballooned to 3.7 billion
pounds (4.1 billion euros, 6.0 billion dollars), a 76-percent increase compared
to the level in 2006, causing the airline to seek a "recovery plan."
</P>
<P>
The huge shortfall risks scuppering BA's proposed tie-up with Iberia, which has
the right to walk away should BA fail to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The merger was seen by analysts as a move to avoid being sidelined by rivals Air
France-KLM and Lufthansa, as the economic downturn and the rise of low-cost
airlines drives airline alliances and steep cost cutting.
</P>
<P>
A combination of BA and Iberia would create one of the world's biggest airlines,
as the two groups grapple with huge losses amid falling demand for air travel.

Eritrea tops list of African nations that jail journalists
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ADDIS ABABA, Dec 8, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York based media rights watchdog the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)
said Tuesday that Eritrea tops the list of African countries that jail
journalists for their work.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, Eritrea ranks fourth, based on CPJ's annual count, which also singles
out countries such as the United States and Iran, the watchdog said.
</P>
<P>
"On December 1, a total of 25 journalists were imprisoned in Sub-Saharan Africa
in retaliation for their journalism, and nearly 90 percent were detained without
charges in secret detention facilities," CPJ said.
</P>
<P>
"With at least 19 journalists behind bars, Eritrea by far leads the list of
shame of African nations that imprison journalists."
</P>
<P>
"The Eritrean government has refused to confirm if the detainees are still
alive, even when unconfirmed online reports suggest that three journalists have
died in detention," CPJ said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea's neighbour Ethiopia comes second with "four journalists held ...,
including two Eritrean journalists who are detained in secret locations without
any formal charges or legal proceedings since late 2006".
</P>
<P>
Globally, China, Iran and Cuba come top of the CPJ list.
</P>
<P>
"Worldwide, a total of 136 reporters, editors, and photojournalists were behind
bars, an increase of 11 from the 2008 tally. The survey also found that
freelancers now make up nearly 45 percent of all journalists jailed across the
globe.

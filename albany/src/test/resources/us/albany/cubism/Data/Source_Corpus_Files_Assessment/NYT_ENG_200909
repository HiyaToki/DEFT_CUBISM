BUS FACTORY, SYMBOL OF STIMULUS, NOW LAYING OFF WORKERS

<P>
It was just five months ago that Vice
President Joe Biden made the New Flyer bus factory here a symbol of
the stimulus. With several Cabinet secretaries in tow, he held a
town-hall-style meeting at the factory, where he praised the
company as "an example of the future" and said that it stood to
get more orders for its hybrid electric buses thanks to the $8.4
billion that the stimulus law devotes to mass transit.
</P>
<P>
But in August, the company that administration officials had
pictured as a stimulus success story began laying off 320 people,
or 13 percent of its work force, having discovered how cutbacks at
the state level can dampen the boost provided by the federal
stimulus money.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Transit Authority did use some of its stimulus money
to buy 58 new hybrid buses from New Flyer. But Chicago had to
shelve plans to order another 140 buses from them after the state
money that it had hoped to use to pay for them failed to
materialize. The delayed order scrambled New Flyer's production
schedule for the rest of the year, and led to the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
The layoffs at New Flyer are a vivid illustration of the way
that some of the economic impact of the $787 billion federal
stimulus law is being diluted by the actions that state and local
governments are taking to weather the recession.
</P>
<P>
While the stimulus law cut federal taxes to inject money into
the economy quickly, at least 30 states have raised taxes since
January, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal fiscal policy group.
</P>
<P>
The stimulus will spend $27.5 billion in federal money on
highway projects, but at least 19 states are planning to cut their
highway spending this year, according to the American Road &amp;
Transportation Builders Association, a trade group. And as the
stimulus devotes $8.4 billion to mass transit, transit systems
across America have been forced to cut service, raise fares and
delay capital spending.
</P>
<P>
Chicago transit officials estimated that they needed $7 billion
for capital improvements. But the state of Illinois, facing budget
pressure, agreed to spend only $2.7 billion, and not all of that
will go to Chicago. The city's hopes for another 140 buses from St.
Cloud were put off.

Hot wheels
      By Tom Long

      Detroit News Film Critic

      TORONTO --

      Drew Barrymore and Ellen Page agree: Michigan is a cool place.
</P>
<P>
The reason they know is they spent a good chunk of 2008 shooting
Barrymore's directorial debut, "Whip It," starring Page, here.
</P>
<P>
The film's production headquarters was in Saline, and the
cameras and crew traveled all over the Detroit area filming the
roller derby story in which Page plays a small-town beauty pageant
contestant who finds freedom smacking into other women while
skating.
</P>
<P>
"I saw a lot of the state. I actually know it quite well,"
Barrymore said while at the Toronto International Film Festival for
the film's premiere. "On Saturday nights, I would go to the 8 Ball
in Ann Arbor and have a cold PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon) and I loved
that. I loved the Majestic in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
"It was great for me because I really found locations that
would work. I found wonderful places," Barrymore said. "I felt
like it was a blessing we got to shoot there."
</P>
<P>
At the festival Page was, if anything, even more enthusiastic
about the state.
</P>
<P>
"From the bottom of my heart, I absolutely loved it, and I say
this all the time. I loved Detroit... I love Ann Arbor,
Ypsilanti," she said. "On Labor Day, I went up to northern
Michigan to go hiking. All over Detroit, you drive 15-20 minutes
and there's some awesome place to hike.
</P>
<P>
"I'd live there in a second," Page said. "I'd go shoot there
in a second; I'd encourage a film to go shoot there."
</P>
<P>
Neither actress is under apparent contract with a local tourist
board, they just seem to genuinely like the state. And then they
spoke about their careers and "Whip It" in the interviews that
follow.

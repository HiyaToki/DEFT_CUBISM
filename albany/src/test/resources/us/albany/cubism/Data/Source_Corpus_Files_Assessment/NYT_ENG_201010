WHITE CRITICAL OF ABSENT PERRY IN DEBATE DEBATE: JUMP HED GOES HERE 30PT HEREY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUSTIN - Former Houston Mayor Bill White eagerly criticized absent
Gov. Rick Perry in Tuesday's debate, but White avoided rating
President Barack Obama's performance in office.
</P>
<P>
White has been criticized for not appearing with Obama when he
was in Austin for a national Democratic fund raiser earlier this
year. And during a statewide televised debate Tuesday, he clearly
was uncomfortable when a panelist asked him to rate the president
on a scale of one to 10.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to give running commentary on our president,
although I would call him president," White said, alluding to his
criticism of Perry for only referring to the president by name
without his title.
</P>
<P>
White said he would work with people on "both sides of the
aisle" if elected governor.
</P>
<P>
But White's two debate opponents, Libertarian Kathie Glass and
Green Party nominee Deb Shafto, had no trouble rating the
president.
</P>
<P>
"Worst president ever," Glass said. "That's why we've got to
get Texas strong."
</P>
<P>
Shafto was far more favorable of Obama, "I'd say a six and a
half or seven. I think he's trying. I think he's constrained by
forces that are not always obvious."
</P>
<P>
The three met in a statewide televised debate that Perry refused
to participate in. Perry campaigned in Amarillo as the debate was
held at the KLRU-TV studios in Austin, sponsored by the Houston
Chronicle, San Antonio Express-News, Austin American Statesman, The
Dallas Morning News and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
Perry said he would not debate because White refused to release
income tax returns from three years when he was a deputy U.S.
secretary of energy in the 1990s. Perry also dismissed the value of
debates, saying the panelists often asked questions that were
unimportant to voters, such as who is the president of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
With Perry absent, White and the other candidates spent most of
the hour critical of Perry and his state policies.
</P>
<P>
White criticized Perry for giving millions of dollars in state
business incentives to companies whose investors have donated to
his campaign but then turned down a request for a Goodyear plant in
Tyler that closed and put average Texans out of work.
</P>
<P>
Glass accused Perry of "dereliction of duty" for his handling
of the border with Mexico. Glass said Perry should send Texas
National Guard troops to the border rather than "beg" Washington
to take care of it.
</P>
<P>
Shafto said she could not think of a single positive thing Perry
has done as governor.
</P>
<P>
But they also took positions on other issues.
</P>
<P>
Shafto said she favors an income tax on the top 20 percent of
earners in Texas to make the state's tax system more fair. Glass
opposed the income tax and said property taxes should be
eliminated. White said he opposed an income tax and a proposed
statewide property tax, but wants to overhaul state's current
property tax system.
</P>
<P>
White and Glass said they favor the death penalty; Shafto said
she opposed it as uncivilized.
</P>
<P>
White said he would oppose legalizing medical marijuana. Shafto
said the nation learned nothing from prohibition and that making
drugs illegal already is creating crime. Glass said as governor she
would sign a law legalizing medical marijuana, but she said it was
only a "hypothetical" because a Republican Legislature would
never pass it.

RIVALS FOR OBAMA ' S EX-SENATE SEAT KEEP UP ATTACKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two candidates running for President Barack
Obama's former Senate seat continued to attack each other on issues
of character in their second debate here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Alexi Giannoulias, the Democratic state treasurer, and Rep. Mark
Steven Kirk, a five-term Republican congressman, met in an hourlong
debate moderated by George Stephanopoulos, the anchor of "Good
Morning America." The candidates sparred over their pasts before
discussing immigration, jobs and corruption at the debate at the
ABC studio in downtown Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The candidates are locked in a close race, according to polls,
with two weeks left until Election Day. The campaign has been
increasingly negative, with each candidate attacking the other's
background in television ads.
</P>
<P>
Giannoulias returned to an issue that arose in the first debate,
repeatedly asking Kirk whether he had ever been shot at during his
time in the Naval Reserve. Kirk has acknowledged that he has made
misleading statements about his service.
</P>
<P>
"Congressman, it's a simple question, were you shot at or
not?" Giannoulias said.
</P>
<P>
Kirk replied that Giannoulias had no right to criticize him
because he had not served in the military.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate irony is that a man who spends most of his
campaign for the Senate criticizing my military record and yet he
never served a day in uniform himself," Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
Both candidates have faced questions about their pasts.
Giannoulias has received criticism for his time as a senior loan
officer at his family's bank, which was seized by federal
regulators this year. Reports have found that the bank made loans
to people with connections to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Kirk said that he had admitted to making mistakes while his
opponent had not fully come clean about his problems.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not perfect," Kirk said. "I made mistakes, but I've
owned them and corrected them. Meanwhile my opponent says nothing
is really his fault."
</P>
<P>
Giannoulias repeatedly sought to tie Kirk to the Bush
administration and to his political adviser Karl Rove. Giannoulias
criticized Rove for providing money for Kirk's campaign without
disclosing donors.
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to let Karl Rove come into town and steal
these elections," Giannoulias said.
</P>
<P>
Kirk said he believed that all outside groups should reveal
their donors and noted that his opponent had taken many
contributions from unions. In a state where Democrats more often
win statewide offices, Kirk also emphasized that he was an
independent Republican who had broken with his party in the past on
issues like stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
Kirk continued to portray himself as a fiscal conservative. "I
am the only candidate in this race who will vote to spend less,
borrow less, tax less," he said.
</P>
<P>
The candidates are seeking to succeed Sen. Roland W. Burris, a
Democrat who was appointed to the seat and is not seeking election.

CANDIDATES RUNNING AGAINST, AND WITH, CABLE NEWS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of the News Corp.
donated $1 million to the Republican Governors Association this
summer, he may have given an even bigger gift to its opponents.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Governors Association said its call to match the
Murdoch contribution raised $1.7 million. Ginning up a fight with
Fox News, which is owned by the News Corp., "helped fire up the
base," said Nathan Daschle, the association's executive director.
</P>
<P>
That is what cable news does now: fire up the base.
</P>
<P>
Even more than they did than in 2008, Fox News Channel and its
left-leaning counterpart MSNBC are playing outsize roles in the
midterm elections this year. Attacking the news media is
time-honored in politics, but the recent fundraising efforts show
how some candidates and groups have been directing their attack ads
this year not at other candidates, but at cable television.
</P>
<P>
Marco Rubio, the Republican Senate candidate in Florida, said in
a Web ad over the summer that his economic plan must be right
because the MSNBC host "Rachel Maddow thinks it's wrong."
Christine O'Donnell, the Republican Senate candidate in Delaware,
criticized "the liberal media led by Rachel Maddow and Keith
Olbermann" in an e-mail pitch last month -- conveniently next to
the "Donate Now" button.
</P>
<P>
And also last month, Ted Strickland, the governor in Ohio, who
is in a tough fight against the Republican John Kasich, a former
Fox News host, incorporated Murdoch's $1 million donation in a
fundraising appeal.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Fox is drawing attention as a fundraising platform
for Republicans. Last week Kasich was given time to promote his
campaign website on "Hannity," a prime time program on Fox News.
Kasich told viewers, "If you have extra nickels or dimes, please
send it our way."
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Sharron Angle, the Republican Senate candidate in
Nevada, acknowledged that she considers fundraising potential when
she accepts or rejects interview requests. Asked by the Christian
Broadcasting Network about her preference for Fox News and "more
conservative outlets," she said, "You can watch -- whenever I go
on to a show like that we get an immediate bump."
</P>
<P>
As for tougher programs like "Meet the Press," which is a
production of NBC and is replayed on MSNBC, she asked, "Well, in
that audience will they let me say I need $25 dollars from a
million people -- go to SharronAngle.com, send money?"
</P>
<P>
Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who is advising Gov. Tim
Pawlenty of Minnesota, said some politicians, like Rep. Michele
Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican, had "clearly benefited
fundraising-wise by having a higher profile."
</P>
<P>
But he also observed that "some of the campaigns that have
raised the most money haven't gone on cable at all."
</P>
<P>
The influence of cable will almost certainly extend into the
next presidential election, since a number of potential candidates
for the Republican nomination are on the payroll of Fox News,
including Mike Huckabee, who has a show on the weekends, and Sarah
Palin.
</P>
<P>
The politicization of cable news has been a long time coming.
Still, it was striking to see Glenn Beck of Fox News hold a
religious-themed rally in Washington in August, and to see Ed
Schultz, who is the host of programs on MSNBC and on radio, kick
off a progressive rally there this month.
</P>
<P>
Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central will stage a
rally in Washington next Saturday, but Stewart says it will not be
political.
</P>
<P>
The evolution of cable hosts from observers to outright
opponents has sometimes been a source of frustration. Maddow said
on her show this month, "For those of us who work here at MSNBC,
one of the most surreal things about this particular election year,
has been conservative politicians' efforts to make us part of the
elections."
</P>
<P>
Maddow bemoaned the fact that politicians like Rubio and Sen.
Scott Brown, R-Mass., invoke her in ads and e-mail appeals, but
turn down her interview requests.
</P>
<P>
Because Fox is the most popular cable news channel by far --
lately it has been averaging about 1.5 million viewers at any given
time on the weekdays, more than CNN and MSNBC combined -- it draws
enormous scrutiny from liberals for what they perceive to be a
right-wing bent in both the news and opinion programming. Olbermann
now calls Fox News "FoxPAC," the insinuation being that the
network is a political arm of the GOP, in part because of Murdoch's
donation.
</P>
<P>
This week the billionaire financier George Soros said he was
donating $1 million to Media Matters, a liberal media monitoring
group, to step up the group's fight against Fox.
</P>
<P>
Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC, and others strenuously
object to the idea that Fox and MSNBC are opposite sides of the
same coin. "Show me an example of us fundraising," he said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
Those examples exist at Fox. The channel was the subject of an
election complaint in Ohio because Kasich was able to ask for money
and display his website address during an interview in August on
"The O'Reilly Factor," Fox's biggest prime time talk show. Kasich
used to host a weekend show on Fox, and Murdoch has called him a
friend.
</P>
<P>
Daschle, whose group filed the complaint, called it "free
advertising," and recited Kasich's claim in a campaign speech that
he raised more than $21,000 in the 12 hours after the interview.
The association withdrew its original complaint in order to amend
it; Daschle said it would file a new complaint soon.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Fox News said the channel declined to comment
for this article.
</P>
<P>
All this political activity has spurred at least a little bit of
hand-wringing at the channels. NBC News, which operates MSNBC,
recently reiterated its rule that employees may not engage in
political activity, but said it had carved out an exception for
some MSNBC hosts.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the most outspoken of the Fox hosts go out and raise
money directly. Hannity has headlined several fundraisers for
Republicans this year. And just last week, Beck donated $10,000 to
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to defend it against criticism from
President Barack Obama-- and challenged his radio listeners to
donate as well. He wanted to make it the chamber's biggest
fundraising day ever.
</P>
<P>
"In the first hour, we beat that goal," he bragged on Fox News
later that day.

PHELPS CASE CUTS TO THE CORE OF FREE SPEECH RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A week after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, I wrote a column
disparaging the false prophets who rise up after almost every
natural or man-made disaster, claiming to have ascertained the will
of God in human tragedy.
</P>
<P>
One of the more notorious of these diviners of destruction is
Fred Phelps, the cadaverous pastor of Westboro Baptist Church in
Topeka, Kan.
</P>
<P>
Phelps derives spiritual sustenance from the belief that God is
wreaking vengeance on the United States for what he perceives to be
the nation's sins, principally homosexuality. The church maintains
the GodHatesAmerica.com website, along with sister sites
GodHatesFags.com, JewsKilledJesus.com and PriestsRapeBoys.com.
</P>
<P>
Just in case I had any doubts about what sanctimonious jerks the
Westboro clan is, Phelps' grandson, Ben, e-mailed me to dispel
them. "God sent Katrina to destroy New Orleans," he wrote while
New Orleans was still under water. "Frankly, I can't think of a
city more deserving of being drowned in feces and rotting flesh."
</P>
<P>
A couple of years later, the Westboro fanatics brought their
road show to San Antonio. I arrived at one of their "protests" in
time to see a handful of adults and children piling into a minivan
like circus clowns with their "God hates fags" and "Thank God
for dead soldiers" signs.
</P>
<P>
You see, according to the Westboro folks, God is punishing the
United States not only with hurricanes but also with improvised
explosive devices and sniper bullets. And they make a point of
delivering that revolting message at the funerals of soldiers and
Marines killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
One of them was Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder, who died in an
accident in Iraq in 2006. Snyder's father sued Phelps and the
church. A jury in a Maryland federal court awarded him $2.9 million
in compensatory damages and $8 million in punitive damages for
invasion of privacy and emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that
judgment, noting that "the safeguards of liberty have often been
forged in controversies involving not very nice people." Now the
U.S. Supreme Court has taken up the volatile case that cuts to the
core of free speech issues.
</P>
<P>
For the high court, a number of precedents exist to reject
content-based restrictions on free speech. Ironically for the
Westboro goons, the most relevant may be found in evangelist Jerry
Falwell's failed attempt to sue Hustler magazine over a
pornographic parody. "If it is the speaker's opinion that gives
offense," the court found in that case, "that consequence is a
reason for according it constitutional protection."
</P>
<P>
In a public statement, Virginia's attorney general explained the
impact on public debate if the judgment against Westboro is
reinstated. "If protestors -- whether political, civil rights,
pro-life, or environmental -- said something that offended the
object of the protest to the point where that person felt damaged,
the protestors could be sued."
</P>
<P>
That's a high price to pay to silence a cretin like Fred Phelps.
</P>
<P>
More than 41 states and the federal government have established
laws that impose time and distance limitations on funeral protests,
both military and non-military. That's a more sensible and
constitutional way of dealing with a despicable form of free
expression.
</P>
<P>
I have had two not-very-close encounters with Westboro Baptist
Church. That was enough. To think that grieving families might hear
or see the taunts of its small-minded bigots on the way to funerals
of sons and daughters, fathers and mothers who have lost their
lives in the service of this nation, is both sickening and
infuriating.
</P>
<P>
But turning Phelps and his band of zealous morons into First
Amendment martyrs is a mistake. And efforts to make their hateful
speech unlawful are a disservice to the Constitution that members
of the military swear an oath to support and defend.

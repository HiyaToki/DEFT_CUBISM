A WANING STAR OF AIR TRAVEL STRUGGLES AS A SOLO ACT

<P>
Has American Airlines, for decades the industry's
leader, been backed into a corner?
</P>
<P>
First, Delta Air Lines' merger with Northwest Airlines two years
ago knocked American to No. 2. Now, the proposed union between
United and Continental Airlines would push American down to third.
</P>
<P>
All this leaves American with some of the industry's highest
costs, as well as poor labor relations and a smaller network of
routes. Some analysts contend that the airline has few options
other than merging with US Airways, which was left out when United
decided to go for Continental. Others see American as the "Ugly
Betty" of the industry, an airline struggling to find a suitable
partner.
</P>
<P>
"American has been used to cruising at 55 miles per hour ahead
of everyone, but now two competitors that are very well
capitalized, with much larger networks, have suddenly passed them
over," said Hunter K. Keay, an airline analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.
"The critical question is whether this is not time for American to
speed up."
</P>
<P>
American's executives counter that they will not be forced into
making a rash move, nor into blindly following the industry's
matchmaking trend. Instead, they argue that being a little smaller
will allow their airline to be more nimble.
</P>
<P>
"We are not ceding anything to anyone, but we are trying to
build something that we believe will be able to be profitable,"
Gerard J. Arpey, the airline's chairman and chief executive, said
in a recent interview at its headquarters in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
Rather than trying to compete everywhere with everyone, American
seeks to focus on five major cities in the United States -- Dallas,
Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and New York. It is more important to
be big in cities that account for a significant portion of the
nation's air travel, its executives reason, instead of spreading
itself too thinly.
</P>
<P>
Overseas, American is betting on its international alliance,
Oneworld, to expand its reach in Europe and Asia, because of
partnerships with British Airways and Japan Airlines.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy is not driven by ranking but by making sure we
have a network and a group of partners around the world that will
be as strong -- if not as big," Arpey said.
</P>
<P>
By most measures, American remains a formidable airline. It
flies about 220,000 people each day, employs 78,900 people, and
along with its regional carrier, American Eagle, operates around
3,400 daily flights to 250 cities and 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
At its shareholders' meeting on Wednesday, American said it
expected that the Oneworld alliance would mean $500 million. It
also has an impressive history, introducing coast-to-coast jet
service in the 1950s, pioneering electronic reservations in the
'60s and offering the first major frequent-flier program in the
'80s.
</P>
<P>
But the last decade has been brutal for American and the rest of
the industry. Airlines suffered from terrorist attacks, global
pandemics and recessions that have curtailed air travel. Oil prices
soared. For every dollar-a-barrel increase in the price of oil,
American's annual fuel costs increased by $70 million. Fares,
meanwhile, have been kept in check because of pressure from
low-cost competitors.
</P>
<P>
As a result, American was profitable for only three of the last
10 years. It racked up losses of $10 billion over that period.
</P>
<P>
But critics on Wall Street and among the company's unions say
they doubt the company can turn its fortunes around. They say
American's management is too timid and unwilling to cut
unprofitable routes, and it has failed to rein in costs, among the
highest in the industry. The United-Continental deal is just the
latest blow.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Hill, the head of American's pilots union, the Allied
Pilots Association, said the company suffered from a "leadership
vacuum." And in a conference call last month, one Wall Street
analyst publicly dressed down the company's executives for a lack
of passion.
</P>
<P>
Shares of AMR are down 9 percent this year, the worst
performance by a major airline and well below the sector's average
gain of 13 percent. By contrast, shares of the UAL Corp., United's
parent, have gained 46 percent; Delta is up 20 percent in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
Bob McAdoo, a senior airline analyst at Avondale Partners, said
that American lags its peers. "Everybody else has seen
improvements in recent years, and American hasn't really done much
of that," he said.
</P>
<P>
American is one of only three major carriers that have never
filed for bankruptcy, along with Southwest Airlines and Alaska
Airlines. As a result, the company is hobbled with much higher
costs than its competitors, most of which have used bankruptcy
proceedings to rewrite their labor contracts and airplane leases,
terminate pensions and health benefits, and restructure their debt.
If it had contracts similar to Delta's or Continental's, the
company estimates its expenses would be $600 million lower each
year.
</P>
<P>
Arpey defends his record. "I still believe in principles in a
business that will often push you to compromise your principles,"
he said. "I believe in the long run it will serve our institution
and our stakeholders that we honored our commitment to our
creditors, funded our pension plans and have done our very best to
do everything consensually. But that remains to be seen."
</P>
<P>
The company anticipates that once other airlines start to
renegotiate their contracts, labor costs will rise through the
industry, narrowing American's cost disadvantage. That, in turn,
may put more pressure on rival airlines to increase fares.
</P>
<P>
Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant, said American had a strong
domestic network and dominant routes to South America. He also
praised the company's decision to buy new fuel-efficient planes and
ground less efficient ones.
</P>
<P>
"All the talk where they have to find a domestic partner, and
where they have to be the biggest, does not make a lot of sense,"
Boyd said. "Remember, the brontosaurus was a really big
dinosaur."
</P>
<P>
While American has not ruled out a merger, its executives have
said on many occasions that they feel no need to consolidate.
Instead, the airline is counting on its international alliance with
Oneworld to catch up with Delta and United, which have been able to
cash in on their competing alliances for years.
</P>
<P>
American's application for antitrust immunity for a joint
venture across the Atlantic with British Airways, first submitted
13 years ago, was granted this year by the Transportation
Department, and European authorities are also expected to give
their green light this year.
</P>
<P>
American hopes to replicate its major cities strategy in the
United States by focusing on a handful of major global hubs --
including Hong Kong, London and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"If you spread yourself too thinly, you win fewer battles,"
said Dan Garton, American's chief marketing officer. He said that
it was more valuable for American to add flights to London and
expand its depth of service than to stretch itself to smaller
markets like Venice or Kiev. "We try to fly to markets that have
the biggest bang for our bucks," he said.

U.S. ORCHESTRA PERFORMS IN CHINA, IN ECHOES OF 1973 (This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) Edward Wong contributed reporting.      BEIJING -- Grant Xia had the misfortune of trying to take up
violin as an amateur during the collective madness of the Cultural
Revolution. Chinese officials banned classical music and sent
musicians to re-education camps. Xia's family collection of more
than 1,000 vinyl records was destroyed. Xia soon stopped playing
the violin.
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1973, as the United States began re-establishing
diplomatic ties with China, President Richard Nixon sent the
Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra to Beijing. It was the first time
an American symphony orchestra had performed in China since the
Communists won the civil war in 1949, and it helped pave the way
for a return of Western art and culture to China when the Cultural
Revolution ended three years later.
</P>
<P>
"I was moved and inspired," Xia said of the snippets of the
performance he heard on the radio. "I would have given anything to
be there."
</P>
<P>
Xia was speaking 37 years later, on Tuesday night, in the
audience in Beijing as the Philadelphia orchestra played
Tchaikovsky's most well-known (and difficult) Violin Concerto in D
major while a rainstorm doused the grand domed theater off
Tiananmen Square commonly called the Egg, or more formally the
National Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
It was the opening night of the orchestra's latest diplomatic
mission to China: its performance in Shanghai on Friday, at the
Chinese government's invitation, as the first foreign ensemble to
play at the 2010 World Expo.
</P>
<P>
The concerts are part of the orchestra's Asian tour, with stops
in South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1973 performance, the orchestra has returned five
times to China, most recently in 2008.
</P>
<P>
For older audience members at the concert on Tuesday, the 1973
performance was on their minds,.
</P>
<P>
"For Chinese music lovers of a certain age, we feel a special
emotional connection with the Philadelphia orchestra," said Yao
Ji, who was in his teens at the time. "Listening to classical
music was a political activity at the time, it was so difficult to
find. But then the orchestra came, and we felt as if spring were
almost here."
</P>
<P>
The original performance was managed by Mao's infamous wife,
Jiang Qing. Later, the musicians were riding buses back to the
hotel when military vehicles sped past and screeched to a halt,
cutting them off in the middle of the road.
</P>
<P>
"One guy got spooked, I remember," said Anthony Orlando, a
percussionist. "He went screaming off the bus. I guess it was too
much Big Brother for him."
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Madame Mao had just wanted a photograph with
the musicians and to hand them little packets of flowers.

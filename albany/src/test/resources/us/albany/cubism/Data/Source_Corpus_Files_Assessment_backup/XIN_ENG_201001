Russia's famed Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU) on Tuesday observed its
255th anniversary since foundation with a traditional mead reception, during
which students braved frigid weather to present their hearty congratulations to
their alma mater.
</P>
<P>
"May our great university prosperous, may all students successful in learning,"
they said at the celebrating reception featuring the traditional Russian mead,
an alcoholic beverage made from fermented honey and water.
</P>
<P>
Several events, including one spectacular gala demonstrating the quintessence of
the Chinese culture, one grand celebration attended by Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov
and Rector Victor Sadovnichii on Monday, have been staged to mark MSU's 255th
anniversary that falls on Jan. 25, which was also Russia's Students' Day, or
Tatyana's Day.
</P>
<P>
Against a freezing cold temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius, MSU teachers
and students walked past a big wooden barrel filled with mead, waiting to
receive a scoopful of the drink distributed by Sadovnichii in person.
</P>
<P>
The rector in his toast thanked those teachers and students for their
attendance, saying: "Since mead barely contains alcohol, it' s OK for us to
drink to our heart's content. Happy birthday to Moscow State University!"
</P>
<P>
His toast was echoed by loud yell of "Hurrah! Hurrah!" from students and
teachers, who revelled in the aroma of the liquor. Laughing and chatting, they
also raised their glasses to welcome Xinhua correspondents.
</P>
<P>
"Happy Tatyana's Day to our alma mater! Wish every one's life as sweet as
honey!" said Anna, a sophomore majoring in public administration.

<P>
A blonde psychology major named Lidya, who won several beauty contests at the
university, told Xinhua that she wished further development of MSU, as well as
academic achievements of all students through hard work.
</P>
<P>
Another sociology major named Jana also wished MSU a brighter future and more
prosperity, while maintaining its first-class status among the world.

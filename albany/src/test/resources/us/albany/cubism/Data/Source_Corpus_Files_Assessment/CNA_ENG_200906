A Taiwan-invested company based in Normandy unveiled a new species of orchid
called Mme Chirac in Paris Wednesday, with more than 80 dignitaries, including
former French first lady Bernadette Chirac and her husband, in attendance.
</P>
<P>
The plant was the creation of Flossan Orchid Co., a company launched by a
Taiwanese businessman in France that imports young orchids from Taiwan and grows
them to maturity at its greenhouse in Normandy.
</P>
<P>
Many of the dignitaries attending the reception to introduce the new orchid,
including Taiwan's representative to France Michel Lu, congratulated the company
on the beauty of the new orchid and praised Taiwan's accomplishments in the
field.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Chirac voiced her appreciation for having the new strain of orchid named
after her and lauded Taiwan's advanced orchid planting techniques.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan exports as many as 36 million orchids, worth over US$20 million, every
year and more than half of the orchids sold in Paris are from Taiwan, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's orchids have made Paris more beautiful," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Flossan's greenhouse occupies some 5,500 square meters and is capable of
producing close to 20,000 orchids each month. Its products target upscale
consumers in the greater Paris area.
</P>
<P>
Flossan will focus on brand building and enhancing its clientele in 2009 to
better tap into the French market and boost revenues, company executives said.

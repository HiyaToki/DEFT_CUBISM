</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nike will pay Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo six million euros per year
until 2014 under a new sponsorship deal it has reached with the Portuguese
winger, sports daily Marca reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old earned 4.5 million euros (6.0 million US dollars) under his
previous contract with the world's largest sporting goods maker, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
While the new deal makes Ronaldo the best paid footballer of those which Nike
sponsors, the amount he makes is still lower than that dished out to other
athletes, such as basketball stars Kobe Bryant and LeBron James of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
Bryant, who plays for the L.A. Lakers, earns 7.5 million euros a year while
James, who plays for Cleveland, earns nine million euros per year, according to
Marca.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the US sportswear-maker stepped up its negotiations with Ronaldo
in the face of attempts by its German rival Adidas to lure him away, it added.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo, who took part in a Nike promotional event in London on Wednesday,
became the world's most expensive footballer when he was transferred from
Manchester United to Real in 2008 for 94 million euros.

CORRECTED: 'Shame on you Toyota' says survivor of high-speed drama
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, Feb 23, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A retired social worker choked back tears Tuesday as she recalled phoning her
husband to say goodbye when her Lexus hurtled out of control at 100 miles per
hour down a busy freeway.
</P>
<P>
Recounting her terrifying brush with death before a congressional panel probing
Toyota's recall crisis, Tennessee woman Rhonda Smith told lawmakers she had
expected to die during the incident in October 2006.
</P>
<P>
Smith was at the wheel of her new Lexus ES 350 and had just merged with traffic
when her car suddenly and inexplicably surged from 70 to 100mph.
</P>
<P>
Despite Smith frantically slamming on the emergency brake and even putting the
car in reverse, the vehicle continued to speed down the freeway.
</P>
<P>
"I figured the car was going to go its maximum speed, and I was going to have to
put the car into the upcoming guardrail in order to prevent killing anyone else
and I prayed for God to help me," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"I called my husband on the Bluetooth phone system," Smith said, wiping away
tears. "I knew -- I'm sorry. I knew he could not help me, but I wanted to hear
his voice one more time."
</P>
<P>
But at that moment, Smith said "God intervened" and the car came very slowly to
a stop and her ordeal was over.
</P>
<P>
Yet Smith and her husband Eddie's relief that a tragedy had been avoided would
turn to anger in the weeks and months after the incident, when they were claim
they were treated with indifference by Toyota and safety investigators.
</P>
<P>
The Smiths disgust mounted when, after repeated demands, Toyota finally
responded and appeared to suggest the owners of the vehicle were at fault.
</P>
<P>
"When we finally forced Toyota to respond in writing, we received a five-
sentence analysis stating, and I quote, 'When properly maintained, the brakes
will always over-ride the accelerator.'
</P>
<P>
"Well, we know that's a lie, and we were outraged that Toyota would suggest in
that statement also that the brakes have to not properly be maintained in order
for that to happen and the car had less than 3,000 miles on it."
</P>
<P>
Smith said they took their complaint to the National Center for Dispute
Settlement but described the proceedings as a "total farce."
</P>
<P>
The local field technician for Lexus participated in the hearing by speakerphone
despite being based only an hour away, and testified that Smith had "caused this
problem by standing on the brakes while spinning the tires."
</P>
<P>
"Well, of course, we were furious that Toyota called us liars a second time,"
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Undeterred, the Smiths took their case to the federal National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA).
</P>
<P>
But although the agency sent investigators to probe the circumstances of the
incident, the Smiths said neither NHTSA nor Toyota took their case seriously.
Eventually, and reluctantly, they gave up their case in 2008.
</P>
<P>
"We hoped that our efforts might spare others the unnecessary terror and pain of
an SUA (sudden unintended acceleration) incident, and it pains our hearts deeply
to realize that we failed," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"But this failure is surely shared by Toyota and NHTSA today. In our view,
they've demonstrated uncaring attitude and disregard for lives.
</P>
<P>
"The results have been tragic. And today, I must say shame on you, Toyota, for
being so greedy and shame on you, NHTSA, for not doing your job."

Jewish group wants British Liberal out over Haiti slur
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
london, Feb 15, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jewish group the Wiesenthal Centre demanded Monday that Britain's Liberal
Democratic party expel a senior lawmaker after she called for a probe into
claims Israeli solders trafficked organs in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
Jenny Tonge was sacked from the opposition party's front bench team at the
weekend over her remarks, with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg describing them as
"wrong, distasteful and provocative."
</P>
<P>
But the Nazi-hunting Wiesenthal Centre said that was not enough, noting that she
had already been fired as the British party's children's spokeswoman in 2004 for
suggesting that she "could consider becoming a suicide bomber."
</P>
<P>
"This agitator, reportedly known in radical circles as ‘Jihad Jenny', is a
hazard to the health, not only of the Liberal Democrat Party, but of the United
Kingdom as a whole," said an open letter to Clegg.
</P>
<P>
"As a recidivist, she should have no place in a party whose constitution
proclaims -- ‘we reject all prejudices and discrimination'," added the
Wiesenthal Centre's director for international relations, Shimon Samuels.
</P>
<P>
Tonge apologised for her remarks about Israeli soldiers in Haiti after telling
the Jewish Chronicle last week that Israel should "establish an independent
inquiry immediately to clear the names of the team in Haiti."
</P>
<P>
Clegg said at the weekend that Tonge's "comments were wrong, distasteful and
provocative and I recognise the deep and understandable distress they have
caused to the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
"While I do not believe that Jenny Tonge is anti-semitic or racist, I regard her
comments as wholly unacceptable. Jenny Tonge apologises unreservedly for the
offence she has caused."
</P>
<P>
Tonge, now a Baroness, was a member of parliament from 1997 until 2005 when she
entered the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, she was sacked for telling a pro-Palestinian meeting that she
empathised with suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
"If I had been a mother and a grandmother in Palestine living for decades in
that situation, I don't know, I may well have become one myself," she said.

Bulgaria hunting Paris student murder convicts
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SOFIA, Feb 6, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bulgaria said Saturday it has issued a warrant for the arrest of two men
convicted in absence this week for stabbing a student to death in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"Police has issued a nationwide arrest warrant for Georgy Zhelyazkov and Stoyan
Stoichkov," the interior ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Zhelyazkov and Stoichkov received 19 and 17 year terms respectively for the
murder of 24-year-old law student Martin Borilski, who was stabbed 93 times with
a knife in his Paris apartment in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The case was closely followed by French authorities after the two suspects were
acquitted by a lower court last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhelyazkov and Stoichkov were not present in the appeal court on Thursday. One
of their lawyers said they were prevented from making it to court by a road
accident.
</P>
<P>
Both Zhelyazkov and Stoichkov had pleaded not guilty at previous hearings,
although DNA samples taken from the victim's fingernails matched their own.
</P>
<P>
Their lawyers have said they will appeal.
</P>
<P>
France had pledged to put them on trial in France if they were again cleared in
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The Borilski case has come under scrutiny from the European Commission,. which
has often criticised Bulgaria's justice system for inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
"The Borilski case is revealing of all the faults of Bulgarian justice --
tardiness, corruption, suspicions of lack of impartiality, the disappearance of
evidence," the Capital business weekly wrote Saturday.

BRONCOS NEED NEW (YOUNG) BLOOD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN DIEGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the mess that was an ugly 35-14 defeat, Denver
safety Brian Dawkins walked through the debris of a cramped locker
room, leaving behind another lost Broncos season with his head held
high.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to continue to fight. That's just what I do,"
Dawkins said Monday.
</P>
<P>
But watching Dawkins give futile pursuit to the San Diego
Chargers, it felt like the end is near.
</P>
<P>
Is Dawkins done? Have the years finally stolen his talent?
</P>
<P>
"It's just a frustrating thing when you're out there on the
field and you start thinking too much," Dawkins said, after nearly
all of his teammates had already departed for the team bus.
</P>
<P>
Under a haunting moon, with a chill rolling in from the Pacific
Ocean, what can make even a strong man shudder is the slow
realization that time eventually beats us all.
</P>
<P>
There's a Hall pass waiting for Dawkins in Canton, Ohio. He is
one of the fiercest safeties to ever play in the league.
</P>
<P>
But Dawkins tackled nothing except air as millions of witnesses
saw on "Monday Night Football." He personified the ineptitude of
a defense that was too slow, too old and too vulnerable to keep the
Broncos in a road game that was their final failed chance to make
the playoffs a relevant issue in Denver as the NFL season gets
serious.
</P>
<P>
It makes zero sense for a team surrendering 28.7 points per game
to employ seven starters over the age of 30. Change is inevitable.
The defense must be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
In a position to put the wood to San Diego receiver Patrick
Crayton late in the second quarter, Dawkins swung and missed, with
his mistake resulting in a 40-yard touchdown that allowed the
Chargers to take a 14-point lead to halftime.
</P>
<P>
"I've got to make that play," Dawkins said.
</P>
<P>
With the same helplessness as chasing lost youth, Dawkins was
made to look old and inadequate on a short pass turned into a
57-yard touchdown by Darren Sproles that shattered the already
fragile spirit of the Broncos on San Diego's opening possession of
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it was tougher to get a grip on Sproles as a 15-year
veteran than a player in his prime, Dawkins definitely said,
"Nah."
</P>
<P>
When he took the job as Broncos coach, Josh McDaniels promptly
hired Dawkins as a free agent, investing a five-year, $17 million
contract in the longtime Philadelphia star. Despite obvious
indications the Eagles thought one of the most beloved players in
their franchise history was well past his prime, McDaniels believed
Dawkins still had the right stuff to intimidate on the field and
lead in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
But, if anything, McDaniels listens too much to the football
ideals in his heart to the extent that it blinds the young coach to
the harsh realities on the game film. Why give up on Peyton Hillis
because he was an imperfect fit for the offensive scheme? What's
the practical impact of spending a first-round draft choice on a
quarterback who's a project, when the Broncos needed immediate
help? Where's the logic constructing a defensive secondary in which
every starter rolls on at least 30-year-old legs?
</P>
<P>
This dangerous naivete in the approach to building a team is
what could eventually get McDaniels fired in Denver. What the
Broncos wanted was the player Dawkins used to be, which unburdened
the team from the cost-effectiveness analysis of how many big hits
the safety had left in his aging body.
</P>
<P>
What McDaniels must do in the final six meaningless games
remaining on the Denver schedule is somehow sell his vision of the
future to disheartened players, an owner who must suffer yet
another season without a playoff berth and disgruntled
Broncomaniacs.
</P>
<P>
It's hard to see how that future includes Dawkins.

Dow Chemical stock rises as demand, investment grow

      By Jaclyn Trop
      The Detroit News
</P>
<P>
Midland - Dow Chemical Co. is emerging from the recession and a
failed joint venture in Kuwait as a stronger, more innovative
company, corporate officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Renewed consumer demand in the United States and abroad, growth
in emerging markets and investing billions of dollars in research
and development will carry Dow into the future, leading to strong
year-over-year gains in 2011 and 2012, Chief Executive Andrew
Liveris said at a Monday press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We are literally bursting at the seams with new projects and
innovation," Liveris said.
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures with national governments and higher profit
margins on products and technologies are also bolstering the
chemical company's growth.
</P>
<P>
Dow has changed its perspective on meeting consumer demand, said
Mike Gambrell, executive vice president of manufacturing and
engineering.
</P>
<P>
"Historically, we worked inside out," Gambrell said. "Now
we're going out and learning what our customers need first."
</P>
<P>
But innovation remains at the forefront of Dow's growth
strategy. Dow's performance division is on track to file for 190
patents this year, up significantly from 2009.
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely on an uptick," said Ganesh Kailasam, the
division's vice president of research and development.
</P>
<P>
These development have led the company's stock price to surge 21
percent since early August, when a lower-than-expected profit for
the second quarter led to a 10 percent drop in the stock price. The
stock, which closed at $25.50 a share on Aug. 3, closed Monday at
$30.87.
</P>
<P>
The firm did better than analysts expected in the third-quarter,
when revenue grew 7 percent and earnings fell because of one-time
charges, according to results released last week.
</P>
<P>
A major Dow product release is scheduled for mid-2011 when its
Dow Solar division brings its solar shingles to market. The
shingles reduce or offset a household's energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
"Residential rooftops are the perfect canvasses to harvest
energy from the sun," said Dow Solar general manager Jane
Palmieri. Dow expects the shingles to act as a "badge of honor"
when homeowners install them, she said.

START-UPS FOLLOW TWITTER INTO THE BUILDING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Joe Fernandez, a tech entrepreneur, moved
his start-up here last spring, a big goal, he said, was "to be
best friends with the Twitter guys." His theory was that by
hanging around with executives at one of the hottest tech companies
today, some of the magic could rub off.
</P>
<P>
And so he snagged an office at 795 Folsom, Twitter's
headquarters in the SoMa neighborhood. There, he has been stalking
executives on -- where else? -- Twitter, to see who is to visit
Twitter's offices. When he finds out, he pounces and "hijacks the
meeting," he said, by asking them to swing by his company, Klout.
</P>
<P>
By doing that, he has met Robert Scoble, the influential
technology blogger, and Steve Rubel, director of insights for the
digital division of Edelman, the big public relations firm, and has
spotted rapper Kanye West in the lobby on his way to Twitter.
</P>
<P>
Through elevator and lobby run-ins, he has also forged a close
enough relationship with Twitter's chief executive, Dick Costolo,
that Costolo is helping Klout raise venture capital.
</P>
<P>
"Now I have his cell phone, and I text him," Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez is not the only Silicon Valley entrepreneur trying to
follow Twitter -- literally. Although the beige-and-brown office
building on Folsom doesn't have a gym, a cafeteria, decent iPhone
reception or a particularly attractive facade, tech start-ups are
jostling to rent offices there. Like middle schoolers drawn to the
popular kid's table in the lunchroom, they are hoping that
proximity to Twitter will lead to chance encounters in the
elevator, partnerships or an acquisition -- or simply that some of
Twitter's fairy dust will land on them.
</P>
<P>
Twitter moved into the sixth floor late last year and expanded
to the third floor in May. Among the start-ups that have moved in
since are Klout, which helps marketers reach influential people on
Twitter; Storify, a service for building online articles out of
media like Twitter posts; and Liquid Traffic, an online marketing
company. All say a top requirement in renting office space was to
be near Twitter, which has attracted 175 million users in just a
few years.
</P>
<P>
Several real estate firms that rent space in the building say
they have noticed the Twitter allure.
</P>
<P>
"Our brokers have received a lot of calls about tenants just
wanting to be close to Twitter, if not in the building, then nearby
in another building, since they're the new hot company," said
Victoria Burkheimer, vice president of acquisitions at Westcore
Properties, which owns 795 Folsom.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez and other Twitter admirers see the irony in their
desire for personal interactions with Twitter executives when their
business is focused on building virtual relationships. "Even
though it's all about tech and the Internet, the real magic of
Silicon Valley comes from people being in the same space," said
Burt Herman, co-founder of Storify.
</P>
<P>
And they may be on to something, said Mark Muro, a senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution who studies the business effects of
innovation clusters. Research shows that physical proximity -- as
close as working in the same building -- leads to increased
knowledge, productivity, income and employment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon has been observed before -- in the songwriting
business, at Manhattan's Brill Building, for instance, and in
science, at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. But the
draw to be near the cool kid in Silicon Valley may reflect the
particular alchemy of business success here -- a mysterious
combination of timing, luck and the fickle preferences of users.
And it may have particular resonance for fast-growing tech
start-ups, Muro said.
</P>
<P>
"For certain early-stage insights and design matters in a very
fast-moving, hot industry, the proximity, even at the room level
and the elevator level, is important," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said he sees a definite payoff, even in more mundane
matters. For example, he frequently hops in the elevator to visit
Twitter to ask technical questions about the company's changes to
its tools for software developers.
</P>
<P>
"I think the person at the front desk thinks I work there," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Andy McLoughlin, co-founder of Huddle, which makes workplace
collaboration software and moved to the building in July, said,
"It's certainly something that adds to the credibility of the
address when you have people coming to see you, and you can say
it's the Twitter building."
</P>
<P>
And the Twitter effect means he gets to meet other start-ups
that have moved nearby.
</P>
<P>
"The buzz of the area is palpable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Roxy Rosen, founder of Liquid Traffic, said her company had been
in the building only since September, so had not yet had
interactions with Twitter. But, she said, since every company she
works with uses Twitter for marketing, as Twitter rolls out tools
for businesses, she hopes to have contact.
</P>
<P>
"It's more likely to happen here," she said, adding: "It's a
very energetic spot. It makes you feel charged up when you walk
in."
</P>
<P>
Another lucky office building, 165 University Avenue in Palo
Alto, was the early home to tech triumphs like Google, when it
employed just six people, PayPal and Logitech. Other start-ups
flocked there, too, seeking a little of the sparkle. And demand has
increased for office space near Microsoft, Oracle and Facebook,
local real estate companies say.
</P>
<P>
The SoMa neighborhood (SoMa is a contraction of South of Market)
has also attracted other hot Web start-ups, including Yelp,
Eventbrite and Zynga, the online game maker that just leased a huge
building nearby. In the past year, the vacancy rate for big
buildings in the area has decreased to 21 percent from 26 percent,
and average rent has increased to $32 from $29 a square foot,
according to the CAC Group, a commercial real estate firm.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Westcore had raised rent to take advantage of the
Twitter effect, Burkheimer laughed and said, "No comment."
</P>
<P>
Still, just as the popular middle schooler moves on to high
school, hot start-ups turn into big companies. With 300 employees
and a rapid pace of hiring, Twitter will outgrow its 62,000 square
feet around next spring, Costolo predicted, and the company will
either need to take over new space in the building or move
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said he was ready.
</P>
<P>
"We've moved past just Twitter; we're on Facebook now," he
said. "We need to establish our own identity. Right now we feel
like we're in Twitter's basement like their kid cousin, so it'll be
good."
</P>
<P>
Biz Stone, Twitter's co-founder, said he could understand why
the younger start-ups would want to be physically close to his.
</P>
<P>
"We spent more money than we probably should have as a start-up
to make everything feel as cool and pretty as we could, so people
wake up in the morning and want to come to work," Stone said.
"I'm not surprised other companies want to take advantage of all
the mojo we put into the place. I would do the same thing."

UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO MUST CAREFULLY SELECT NEW ARCHITECT OF FOOTBALL PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The University of Colorado's selection of a new football coach
could be the school's most critical hire since 1917 when architect
Charles Klauder was chosen to design a unique master plan for the
Boulder campus.
</P>
<P>
CU must seek a similar visionary who will develop a successful
and unique plan for the future of Buffaloes football.
</P>
<P>
As the university's football program has gone from the
"scorched earth" Dan Hawkins claimed he inherited to a colossal,
meteor-sized crater he left beneath the Flatirons, it confronts a
new era, new financial difficulties, another new reconstruction and
rejuvenation and a new conference.
</P>
<P>
The Buffs need a winner.
</P>
<P>
They can't join the Pac-12 on a hope and a dare and a weak
coach.
</P>
<P>
Athletic director Mike Bohn understands fully his long-term
employment depends on the pick, and Colorado president Bruce Benson
and Boulder chancellor Phil DiStefano know how important the first
football coach chosen during their charge is to CU, fundraising and
their reputations.
</P>
<P>
So those three and the selection (advisory) committee -- composed
of the faculty's athletic representative, the school's CFO, an
interim vice chancellor, a professor and three prominent boosters
who are CEOs of major companies -- can't afford (figuratively and
literally) another Hawkins Blunder.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 candidates have been considered, discussed and
investigated; several have been contacted directly or indirectly; a
few already have been invited for interviews, and the number has
been shortened to A, B and C lists.
</P>
<P>
Although Bohn, who will make the final pronouncement, said this
week he will not comment again on any contenders, it is known he
has received hundreds of calls from candidates' supporters and
lobbyists (including NFL coaches) and personal pleas for the
position from prominent college coaches.
</P>
<P>
Despite what many believe, this is a highly sought job, and it
could pay more than most believe.
</P>
<P>
The speculated or confirmed candidates' list includes former
head college coaches (Bill McCartney and Mike Bellotti), ex-NFL
coaches (Mike Nolan and Jon Gruden), current college head coaches
(Air Force's Troy Calhoun, Houston's Kevin Sumlin, San Diego
State's Brady Hoke and Georgia's Mark Richt), college assistants
(Auburn's Gus Malzahn, Alabama's Jim McElwain, Oklahoma's Brent
Venables, Nebraska's Shawn Watson and Florida State's Mark Stoops),
NFL assistants (Eric Bieniemy and Jeremy Bates), high school
coach/Broncos broadcaster Dave Logan and interim CU coach Brian
Cabral.
</P>
<P>
Mike Leach, Mike Price and Mark Mangino also have been
mentioned, but CU has ruled them out because of past controversies.
</P>
<P>
And, almost a month ago in a column recommending that Hawkins
resign, I first brought up one more name.
</P>
<P>
"Les Miles of LSU probably could be lured to CU. Miles and LSU
have just about had enough of each other, and the coach of the 2007
BCS champions has said to friends that his favorite place to live
and coach was Boulder, where he served as offensive line coach
under McCartney from 1982-86. Would the 'Mad Hatter,' so-named
because of his dicey play-calling and odd nature, be the first
choice as Les 'Miles High'?"
</P>
<P>
I stand by that statement, which has been widely circulated, and
commented on, in Louisiana and throughout the SEC. Despite a 9-1
record this season at LSU, so many people in that state want Miles
fired. He receives about $3.8 million per year, but his only exit
buyout is if he goes to Michigan.
</P>
<P>
DiStefano is on record saying he favors "a coach who is either
successful now as a head coach or has recent coaching experience
either with someone from the Pac-12 or the Big 12, somebody in a
conference similar to, if not equal to, the conference that we're
joining."
</P>
<P>
Several head or assistant coaches would fit the criteria.
Minnesota Vikings coach Brad Childress said Friday he had been
contacted by the search committee about Bieniemy, his running-backs
coach. Bieniemy played and coached at CU and also has been a UCLA
assistant.
</P>
<P>
Bellotti -- former Oregon coach, then athletic director -- and
McCartney, who guided the Buffs to their only national
championship, say they have been approached by CU to gauge their
interest.
</P>
<P>
The coordinators at Auburn, Alabama and Oklahoma probably would
qualify but haven't been head coaches. Nebraska's Watson was a head
coach and served as an assistant at CU but insists he's not a
candidate. Houston's Sumlin was the offensive coordinator at
Oklahoma, but one mark against him is he took an assistant's job
with CU in January 2003 but resigned a month later.
</P>
<P>
Is Calhoun in a conference "equal to"? The Mountain West's TCU
is ranked third in the BCS poll.
</P>
<P>
Bellotti and McCartney (who both have many backers and as many
detractors), Bieniemy and Sumlin (African-Americans), Logan (who
has never served on a college staff but played at CU and in the NFL
and has won five state high school titles, three at Mullen) and
Cabral (who played at CU and in the NFL and has been on staff in
Boulder since 1989) likely will get interviews.
</P>
<P>
One member of the search committee, George Solich, began efforts
months ago to entice 50 superboosters to contribute $1 million each
to the football program. The dormant idea will be revived with the
firing of Hawkins and the switch to the Pac-12. A $50 million
influx will greatly aid CU in wading out of debt caused by the
moves.
</P>
<P>
The process should be rather speedy, given the research already
done, the narrowing of the candidates, the interview process and
the NCAA regulations which allow coaches' visits to recruits' homes
starting on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
The coach ultimately selected has to be as triumphant on his
field as Charles Klauder was in his field. Klauder was a great
hire. His "Tuscan vernacular" created an everlasting legacy.

MEXICAN NAVY DRIVES OUT GANGS IN TOURIST-ORIENTED BORDER TOWN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NUEVO PROGRESO, Mexico 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On fall and winter weekends, droves of
Rio Grande Valley residents and American snowbirds still cross the
Rio Grande here, drawn by the $1 cold Coronas, $1.50 shoe shines,
$4 haircuts, $15 tooth extractions and cut-rate prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
For the bolder, bargains on plastic surgery and dental implants
are also available.
</P>
<P>
While American tourists are quickly becoming extinct elsewhere
along the Mexican border because of alarming travel advisories and
narco violence, this shopper's Mecca continues to pack them in.
</P>
<P>
This year, more than 1 million pedestrians and almost as many
motorists are expected to cross the bridge to shop and dine in this
town of 15,000 just a few miles south of Weslaco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
"No U.S. or Canadian citizens have been endangered in anyway,"
claims the town's upbeat website, which also boasts that Nuevo
Progreso "is the safest place to cross the Mexico border."
</P>
<P>
And indeed, with violence raging to the east in Matamoros, and
upriver in Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo, this bazaar of bridge urchins
begging for change, politely insistent sidewalk vendors and
jam-packed curio shops exists as an island of border tranquility.
</P>
<P>
"Oh my God, I wouldn't even consider going to Matamoros," said
Joann Anderson, 63, of Huntsville, Texas, visiting with her husband
Thomas. "I love coming here. We come for the dentistry, to get
glasses and to buy antibiotics and hormones. I feel safe here."
</P>
<P>
Only one violent incident has occurred, a shootout in December
that left two dead. But beneath the almost quaint, throw-back
ambiance of tourist-friendly Mexico is another story.
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, a criminal organization has operated
here, extorting and kidnapping local businessmen with impunity.
</P>
<P>
Not until the arrival of marines from the Mexican Navy early
last month were the gangsters, who had shown no fear of the state
police or Army soldiers prominently stationed at the bridge, chased
from town.
</P>
<P>
"It was invisible. The tourists didn't know anything about the
extortions," said one dentist who asked not to be named. "Some of
the bars closed because of the extortions, and I'm sure there were
kidnappings."
</P>
<P>
A medical doctor said the existence of the extortion racket was
widely whispered but never talked about openly because of fear.
</P>
<P>
"The town was full of secretive voices. But no one would ever
say, 'I'm paying.' Everyone was scared," he said, also asking not
to be named. "It never touched me. I don't know who they were."
</P>
<P>
One local businessman agreed to talk about the racket on the
condition he not be identified. He said he paid at least $25,000 to
the gangsters over two years and lost most of his businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, everything was perfect here. We knew the drug
gangs existed, but they didn't bother us here," he recalled in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
That changed around Thanksgiving 2008, when some armed men asked
him to take a ride with them in an SUV. When the trip was over, he
had new business partners and their terms were clear and harsh.
</P>
<P>
"They told me I had to pay $5,000 up front for each of my three
businesses, and $500 a month after that. They didn't threaten me.
They just said pay up or you know what will happen," he recalled.
And for nearly two years, he was slowly starved out of business.
</P>
<P>
"Young guys, about 18 years old, would come around and say,
'I'm here for the 'quota,' and if I didn't have it, I knew I would
have to close. We never knew who they were, the Zetas, La Familia,
the Gulf Cartel or someone else," he said.
</P>
<P>
In quietly comparing notes with others, he learned who else was
being extorted.
</P>
<P>
"All the bars were paying, and some of the pharmacies," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the extortion and a depressed economy forced him to
close all but one of his businesses. He said he made his last $500
payment about a month ago, just before the dramatic arrival of the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
Others, whom he knows personally, fared even worse.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of important people were forced to leave. Some other
people were kidnapped. They charged $1 million or $1.5 million to
let them go," he added.
</P>
<P>
When the Navy arrived in force in early October, the
extortionists vanished.
</P>
<P>
"They came in with three helicopters and about 200 marines. Not
a shot was fired. They knew exactly where to go to get these
guys," he said. "They rounded up all the police, everyone
pertaining to the police. They grabbed the people who were charging
the quotas. And now they are in charge."
</P>
<P>
At one of the dozens of pharmacies on the main drag offering
bargains with few strings attached, such as $4.95 for a bottle of
120 Prilosec pills, a store clerk in a white smock explained why
the owner was absent.
</P>
<P>
"Like the others, he moved across to the other side. People
told me he had been threatened. He's been gone for more than a
year. A lot of people with money left," he said, declining to give
his name.
</P>
<P>
"All the businesses were paying quotas. It ended when the
marines came."
</P>
<P>
When the marines arrived, they went door-to-door handing out
fliers that read: "Enough! Don't allow more robberies,
kidnappings, corruption or violent acts against your family. The
Navy has no pacts with criminal organizations. We are here to serve
our Mexican society."
</P>
<P>
Included was a phone number and e-mail address to anonymously
denounce the criminals.
</P>
<P>
Contacted at their base in Progreso, Navy officials declined to
comment on their operation.
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Trevino, president of the local chamber of commerce and
the owner of a building materials company, was one of the few here
who agreed to talk on the record.
</P>
<P>
He attributed a 30 percent drop in tourist visits over the past
several years, and the failure of some businesses, to multiple
factors. It began with a change in U.S. policy toward requiring a
passport for returning Americans that killed off the youthful
night-time drinking crowd.
</P>
<P>
Added to this, he said, were the swine flu scare of 2009, the
U.S. financial crash of 2008, and the continuing "insecurity"
problem in northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
But, Trevino said, even though he heard plenty of rumors, he had
no direct knowledge of an organized crime group operating in town.
</P>
<P>
"They never approached me for money. The ones targeted were the
bars. I've also heard rumors of kidnappings," he said. "What
happened here is nothing compared to what happened elsewhere. The
main reason for the failed businesses is the drop in tourism."
</P>
<P>
Some signs indicate that the town's season of torment may be
ending.
</P>
<P>
On a recent Saturday, the parking lot on the U.S. side of the
river was full of cars, some bearing license plates from Minnesota,
North Dakota, Illinois and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
Along Avenida Benito Juarez, the sidewalks were jammed with
tourists dodging vendors who hawked everything from diced cactus to
gold crowns to male virility pills. It was almost like the good-old
days.
</P>
<P>
"I think with the arrival of the Navy, the fear will go away.
We are a city that depends 100 percent on the United States. When
the rumors die down, the people will return," said a medical
doctor, who asked not to be named. "I'm seeing patients I haven't
seen in eight months. Now they are coming back," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some tourists who never quit coming say Nuevo Progreso remains a
unique and charming window to Mexico, perhaps the last one
available to Texans.
</P>
<P>
"We've been coming for 15-20 years, about once a month. It's
real pleasant.
</P>

"We've seen a lot of change for the good. And we've never seen

ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE CRITICIZES BECK FOR SOROS REMARKS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fox News host Glenn Beck was criticized by the Anti-Defamation
League, a leading Jewish advocacy organization, on Thursday in
response to a televised segment about financier George Soros and
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
Throughout three programs this week, Beck has portrayed Soros, a
billionaire investor and philanthropist, as a "puppet master" who
is "notorious for collapsing economies and regimes all around the
world" and whose "next target" is America. Citing Soros'
statements about the decline of the dollar, Beck said, "Not only
does he want to bring America to her knees, financially, he wants
to reap obscene profits off us as well."
</P>
<P>
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League,
took issue with Beck's depiction of Soros as a "Jewish boy helping
sending the Jews to the death camps," calling it "offensive" and
"horrific."
</P>
<P>
On his Fox program Tuesday, watched by about 2.8 million people,
Beck said that during the Holocaust, the 14-year-old Soros "used
to go around with this anti-Semite and deliver papers to the Jews
and confiscate their property and then ship them off."
</P>
<P>
Beck continued: "I am certainly not saying that George Soros
enjoyed that, even had a choice. I mean, he's 14 years old. He was
surviving. So I'm not making a judgment. That's between him and
God." He also said that "many people" would call Soros "an
anti-Semite," although "I will not."
</P>
<P>
Fox stood by Beck. Joel Cheatwood, a senior vice president at
Fox News, said in a statement Thursday afternoon that the
"information regarding Soros' experiences growing up were taken
directly from his writings and from interviews given by him to the
media, and no negative opinion was offered as to his actions as a
child."
</P>
<P>
Still, Foxman asserted that Beck's invoking of the childhood
experience was "unacceptable," adding, "To hold a young boy
responsible for what was going on around him during the Holocaust
as part of a larger effort to denigrate the man is repugnant."
</P>
<P>
Beck has sparked controversy in the past for repeatedly invoking
the Holocaust and Nazi Germany. But some Jewish leaders have backed
him up in the past, and Tuesday, Beck said he was "probably more
supportive of Israel and the Jews than George Soros is."

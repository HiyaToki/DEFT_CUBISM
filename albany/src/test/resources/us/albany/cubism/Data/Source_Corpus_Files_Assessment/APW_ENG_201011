Poland's president says NATO should take account of eastern European countries' interests as it seeks better ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
President Bronislaw Komorowski wrote in an article for Thursday's Gazeta Wyborcza daily that he supports developing "constructive relations" with Russia which would be "positive for the security of both sides."
</P>
<P>
But he added: "The alliance's relations with Russia should not be developed at the expense of the security interests of other countries in eastern Europe."
</P>
<P>
Komorowski didn't specify what steps might raise such concerns.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is to join a NATO-Russia session alongside this weekend's NATO summit in Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>

<P>
A U.S. Army staff sergeant who stepped into the line of fire to help a pair of comrades on the Afghan battlefield received the Medal of Honor on Tuesday -- the nation's top military award.
</P>
<P>
President Barack Obama awarded the medal to Salvatore Giunta at a White House ceremony, making the 25-year-old Iowan the first living service member from the Iraq or Afghanistan wars to be so honored. Seven others have received the award posthumously.
</P>
<P>
Obama called Giunta a solider who is "as humble as he is heroic" and said the ceremony was a "joyous occasion."
</P>
<P>
The Army says Giunta was a rifle team leader in eastern Afghanistan's Korengal Valley when his squad was split in two after an ambush by insurgents. While under fire, Giunta pulled a fellow soldier to cover and rescued another who was being dragged away by the enemy.

MGM Resorts posts 3Q loss on CityCenter writedown
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LAS VEGAS 2010-11-03 21:10:24 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Casino operator MGM Resorts International said it lost less money in its third quarter than a year earlier, and its shares soared following upbeat comments by company executives Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The casino operator in which Kirk Kerkorian is a major investor said the Las Vegas market is continuing to stabilize. And executives highlighted growth opportunities in Macau, China. They also said they are pursuing talks with an unnamed bidder for MGM Resorts' stake in the Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
"We have made significant progress on our financial position this year and have deployed several programs to better position our portfolio of resorts to benefit from a broader economic recovery going forward," Chairman and CEO Jim Murren said on a conference call with analysts.
</P>
<P>
But the company, based in Las Vegas, recorded significant drops in the value of both the Borgata and -- for a third time -- its mammoth CityCenter joint venture in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Based on that bid, MGM Resorts said, the value of its investment in the Borgata joint venture has fallen $128 million. The company's total third-quarter writedown of $357 million, or 51 cents per share, includes residential units at CityCenter, as well as the Las Vegas complex overall and the Borgata.
</P>
<P>
The company posted a loss of $318 million, or 72 cents per share, for the period that ended Sept. 30. A year earlier, it lost of $750.4 million, or $1.70 per share.
</P>
<P>
Without the writedowns, MGM Resorts lost 21 cents per share for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, whose estimates usually don't account for one-time items like writedowns, expected a loss of 23 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 2 percent to $1.56 billion from $1.53 billion, besting Wall Street's $1.55 billion, as its reimbursements increased from joint venture partner Dubai World for managing CityCenter. Gambling, hotel room and food and beverage revenue all fell.
</P>
<P>
MGM Resorts shares climbed $1.16, or 10.4 percent, to close Wednesday at $12.31. They were unchanged after hours.
</P>
<P>
Analysts were less enthusiastic about the report, which MGM Resorts released weeks earlier in preliminary form. Jeffries and Co. praised the company's effort to cut debt, but said the results fell below the firm's expectations and MGM Resorts still faces falling demand.
</P>
<P>
Murren said special events like concerts and holiday weekends encouraged its customers to spend more. And revenue per available room rose at its luxury hotels, the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay.
</P>
<P>
"We have finally seen some pockets of absolute strength," Murren said.
</P>
<P>
Established U.S. casinos have struggled to recover from the economic downturn as consumers keep a tighter grip on their money.
</P>
<P>
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Dan D'Arrigo said in an interview with The Associated Press that MGM Resorts' Las Vegas hotels are routinely 90 percent occupied or better. A key component is the return of convention business, which is driving both occupancy levels and midweek room rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Macau, where the company had its best quarter ever, operating income rose to $61 million from $50 million. It did not break out its revenue for Macau, the only place in China where gambling is legal.
</P>
<P>
Rival Wynn Resorts Ltd. said Tuesday that revenue for its Wynn Macau resorts surged nearly 50 percent from last year, when the Encore at Wynn Macau wasn't yet open.
</P>
<P>
D'Arrigo said MGM Resorts hopes to grow in Macau and is pursuing a second site to open a casino there with its partner Pansy Ho, daughter of famed casino mogul Stanley Ho.
</P>
<P>
He said MGM Resorts and the party that has bid $250 million for MGM Resorts' half of the Borgata are working quickly to complete the deal.

Released Egypt blogger to keep writing after jail
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CAIRO 2010-11-24 16:37:50 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recently released Egyptian blogger who served the longest prison term in the Arab world for his writings said Wednesday that jail was a "cruel experience" but his views remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Kareem Nabil, known by his blogging name Kareem Amer, was arrested in March 2006 and convicted of insulting Islam and the president in his blog. He served four years in prison and was released on Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
Described by rights groups as a prisoner of conscience, Nabil was an outspoken secularist and sharp critic of conservative Muslims. He often lashed out at Al-Azhar -- the most prominent religious center in Sunni Islam -- calling it "the university of terrorism" and accusing it of encouraging extremism.
</P>
<P>
He called Al-Azhar the "other side of the coin of al-Qaida" and said the 1,000-year-old university should be dissolved or turned into a secular institution.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized Mubarak, calling him "the symbol of tyranny."
</P>
<P>
The United States described the conviction of Nabil as "a setback for human rights."
</P>
<P>
During his imprisonment, he told reporters, he was beaten up, slapped in the face, deprived of visits and insulted by police officers.
</P>
<P>
"One police officer was beating me up then tried to force me to smile while filming me with his mobile," he said. Another time, he lost a front tooth when he was attacked by a fellow prisoner, who was also working as a police informant.
</P>
<P>
Nabil spent an extra 10 days in detention past his official release date. Before he was finally let go, he was blindfolded and summoned by a pair of police officers who vowed to return him to prison if he didn't change his views.
</P>
<P>
"They slapped me in the face, showered me with insults and threatened to torture me," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Now 26, Nabil plans to continue his studies, stay away from Al-Azhar, and continue his writings.
</P>
<P>
"If I go back in time, I will not change a bit. I have no regret," he said. "It was a cruel and tough experience," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his blog, he wrote a commentary following clashes between Muslims and Christians in 2005 saying that "Muslims revealed their true ugly face and appeared to all the world that they are full of brutality, barbarism and inhumanity."
</P>
<P>
He called Muhammad's 7th century companions -- who are deeply revered by devout Muslims -- "spillers of blood" for their teachings on warfare.

Drug lord ' s death could empower rival Zetas gang
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MEXICO CITY 2010-11-07 01:14:48 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day after marines killed a reputed powerful drug lord, dozens of ominous banners apparently hung by rivals appeared Saturday in cities across Mexico's Gulf coast with messages gloating about his demise.
</P>
<P>
The signs, hung on pedestrian bridges and other public places but quickly taken down by authorities, reinforced fears that the death of alleged Gulf cartel leader Antonio Ezequiel Cardenas Guillen will further empower the Zetas, a gang of hit men formed more than a decade ago by renegade Mexican soldiers that has become one of Mexico's most brutal and feared drug gangs.
</P>
<P>
Former allies of the Gulf cartel, the Zetas went independent earlier this year, unleashing a turf battle along the northeastern border with the United States that has at times reached the level of all-out war.
</P>
<P>
Drug gangs used vehicles to put up roadblocks Saturday morning in Reynosa, a city across from McAllen, Texas, according to Twitter messages from the Reynosa city government warning citizens to travel with caution. It was unclear if the roadblocks were related to the death of Cardenas Guillen.
</P>
<P>
Such blockades have become a near-daily gang tactic in northeastern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
But Friday night, buses and cars were used to block roads and highways in the western city of Morelia -- stronghold of La Familia cartel -- suggesting that the tactic could be spreading across Mexico. Several vehicles were torched, and one driver was injured when assailants stole his bus to use in the blockades, according to the attorney general's office of Michoacan state.
</P>
<P>
Cardenas Guillen, known as "Tony Tormenta" or "Tony the Storm," was killed Friday during a two-hour shootout in an operation that included 150 marines, three helicopters and 17 military vehicles, the Mexican navy said in a statement. Four of his gunmen and three marines also died during the fighting in the city of Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas. A local reporter and a soldier were killed in related mayhem.
</P>
<P>
President Barack Obama called his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, on Saturday morning to reaffirm U.S. support for Mexico's efforts to fight the cartels, and express his condolences for the troops killed in the shootouts, according to a White House statement.
</P>
<P>
Mexican presidential security spokesman Alejandro Poire touted Cardenas Guillen's downfall as "another meaningful step toward the dismantling of criminal groups."
</P>
<P>
The Zetas, apparently, also celebrated.
</P>
<P>
The banners, which appeared in several cities of northeastern Tamaulipas state, neighboring Veracruz state, and in the resort city of Cancun on the Yucatan Peninsula, crowed: "Once again the destiny of the traitors has been demonstrated, crushing the Gulf traitors."
</P>
<P>
They were signed, "Sincerely, the Zetas Unit."
</P>
<P>
Veracruz Public Safety Secretary Sergio Lopez said authorities were not yet sure who put up the poorly written and obscure messages, and could not confirm that they were a reaction to the death of Cardenas Guillen.
</P>
<P>
Francisco Alor, the attorney general of the Caribbean state of Quintana Roo, said several banners appeared in the resort city of Cancun and he expressed concern that violence in the region could spike.
</P>
<P>
"We have to prevent any surge (in violence) that the others could generate as they move to control territory amid the power vacuum," Alor told The Associated Press, referring to the Zetas.
</P>
<P>
Drug war experts warned that the Zetas will strengthen as the Gulf cartel weakens.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it's another major blow to the one of the most significant Mexican drug cartels," Gary Hale, who retired this year as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and founded the Grupo Savant consulting firm, said of Cardenas Guillen's death.
</P>
<P>
"But it also bodes an ominous future for the war-weary civilians living in the northeastern part of Mexico," he said in an analysis sent to AP. "The ensuing chaos brought on by the loss of Gulf Cartel leadership will give operational, political and psychological strength to the Zetas."
</P>
<P>
Even before their split from the Gulf cartel, the Zetas started growing into a powerful gang in their own right. Their reach extends into Central America, where authorities have dismantled Zetas training camps, and their illegal activity ranges from drug trafficking to migrant smuggling, kidnapping and extortion.
</P>
<P>
Hale warned that the Zetas, in their push to assert dominance over northeastern Mexico, are likely to increase "their traditional organized crime activities such as extortion of businesses of all sorts, kidnappings for ransom, an increase in taxation ... for drugs crossing into the U.S. from Mexico."
</P>
<P>
The banners Saturday vowed that "the Zetas will be there" to finish off their rivals and appeared to lament that the Mexican marines "got ahead of us."
</P>
<P>
It's a chilling message if it really did come from the Zetas, an organization believed to have introduced the now-common cartel tactic of beheading rivals. Authorities have blamed the gang for the worst cartel massacre in Mexico's history: the August slaughter of 72 South and Central American migrants who apparently refused to work for the Zetas.
</P>
<P>
The banners promised revenge against "traitors ... from the school of the informant Osiel," an apparent reference to the slain trafficker's brother, Osiel Cardenas Guillen, who led the Gulf cartel until his arrest by Mexican authorities in 2003. Osiel was extradited to the United States in 2007 and sentenced to 25 years in prison by a Texas court in February.
</P>
<P>
Hale said Osiel Cardenas Guillen is rumored to have cooperated with U.S. law enforcement from prison. Several Zetas bosses were killed or arrested in the period between the capo's extradition to the U.S. and his sentencing, Hale said.
</P>
<P>
While no definitive link has been made between Osiel Cardenas' cooperation and the downfall of the Zetas leaders, the Zetas became "increasingly paranoid" and finally split from the Gulf cartel early this year, Hale said.
</P>
<P>
The downfall of Cardenas Guillen is a potential boon for the Zetas just as they are fighting off an assault from three powerful rivals. Mexican and U.S. officials say the Gulf cartel enlisted the help of the Sinaloa and La Familia gangs earlier this year in their campaign to destroy the Zetas.
</P>
<P>
"It will be even more difficult to defeat Los Zetas now because the Gulf Cartel -- part of the troika (Gulf, Sinaloa, and La Familia) ... has been weakened," said George Grayson, a Mexico expert at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, who has written books about the Zetas.

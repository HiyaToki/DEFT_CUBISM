China blocking Twitter, websites: RSF

China blocked access to Twitter, Flickr and other websites Tuesday, two days
ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, Reporters
Without Borders (RSF) said, expressing "outrage" at the move.
</P>
<P>
"Reporters Without Borders is outraged by the blockage of a dozen websites such
as Twitter, YouTube, Bing, Flickr, Opera, Live, Wordpress and Blogger in China,"
the media rights group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government stops at nothing to silence what happened 20 years ago
in Tiananmen Square," RSF said.
</P>
<P>
"By blocking access to a dozen websites used daily by millions of Chinese
citizens, the authorities have opted for censorship at any price rather than
accept a debate about this event."
</P>
<P>
RSF said it had been notified by Chinese Internet users that access to the
websites began being blocked inside China on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from Microsoft, which recently launched its new
search engine Bing, Yahoo!, which owns photo-sharing site Flickr, or Twitter to
emails from AFP asking about the reported move by China.
</P>
<P>
Google-owned YouTube has been blocked inside China since March.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign correspondents' association on Tuesday condemned moves by
authorities in Beijing to block reporting in the run-up to the anniversary of
the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) said it had received at least
three reports of authorities blocking reporting at Tiananmen Square and
intimidating journalists or their sources.
</P>
<P>
The country's communist leadership sent soldiers to forcibly clear the square
and surrounding areas on the night of June 3-4, 1989, ending seven weeks of
protests calling for political reforms.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds, possibly thousands, were killed in the crackdown, which remains a
taboo subject in China.

CORRECTED: Australian deputy PM at boiling point over Ramsay rant

Sydney, June 9, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay was told he should stick to cooking by Australia's
deputy prime minister Tuesday over a rant in which he suggested a female TV
presenter was a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
The British cook attacked Nine Network's "A Current Affair" presenter Tracy
Grimshaw at a Melbourne cooking expo on Saturday, the day after she interviewed
him.
</P>
<P>
In front of thousands of onlookers, Ramsay suggested Grimshaw was a lesbian and
needed "to see Simon Cowell's botox doctor."
</P>
<P>
He also showed a picture of a woman apparently naked on all fours with the face
of a pig and said "that's Tracy Grimshaw." His publicist has since said the
comments were a joke and not intended to cause offence.
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard was unimpressed, saying Ramsay had
displayed bad manners and poor taste.
</P>
<P>
"I understand from the publicity that Gordon Ramsay is a good chef," Gillard
said.
</P>
<P>
"I think perhaps what he should do is confine himself to the kitchen and make
nice things for people to eat rather than make public comments about others."
</P>
<P>
Grimshaw also hit back at the "Hell's Kitchen" supremo, labelling him an
"arrogant narcissist" on her current affairs show on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
She said there was nothing funny about Ramsay's insults, which had upset her
friends and family, including her mother.
</P>
<P>
"Truly, I wonder how many people would laugh if they were effectively described
as an old, ugly pig," she said, adding that she had agreed not to probe Ramsay
over an extra-marital affair when he appeared on the show.
</P>
<P>
Grimshaw said she initially considered not responding to Ramsay's comments but
decided she had to stand up for herself.
</P>
<P>
"We all know that bullies thrive when no one takes them on and I'm not going to
sit meekly and let some arrogant narcissist bully me," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously Gordon thinks that any woman who doesn't find him attractive must be
gay," she added. "For the record, I don't. And I'm not."

Khmer Rouge followed communist icons: prison chief
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Phnom Penh, June 9, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge's former jailer said Tuesday the regime practised a "criminal"
mix of the theories of Marx, Lenin and China's "Gang of Four" as it killed
thousands of people in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Kaing Guek Eav, better known by his nom de guerre Duch, is on trial for
overseeing the torture and extermination of 15,000 people who passed through the
hardline communist movement's notorious Tuol Sleng prison.
</P>
<P>
Duch told the UN-backed war crimes court that Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, who
died in 1998, applied a mix of communist ideas to orchestrate extreme social
reforms.
</P>
<P>
But he said the regime had "more seriously cruel policies than those of (the)
Gang of Four of China" since it enslaved the population on collective farms and
began to carry out mass killings immediately after seizing power.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of (the Khmer Rouge) was criminal," Duch said. "The killing was
widespread."
</P>
<P>
He added that only the "collective peasant class and collective worker class"
remained throughout the country after the educated and elites were murdered.
</P>
<P>
The former maths teacher, 66, wearing a white long-sleeved shirt, told the court
that the Khmer Rouge's policy was to root out all enemies who did not share its
ideology.
</P>
<P>
Duch apologised at his trial late March, saying he accepted blame for the
extermination of thousands of people at the prison, which served as the centre
of the 1975-1979 regime's security apparatus.
</P>
<P>
On Monday Duch told the trial that his staff had murdered babies by smashing
them against trees at a "killing field".
</P>
<P>
But he has denied prosecutors' claims that he played a central role in the Khmer
Rouge's iron-fisted rule, and maintains he only tortured two people himself and
never personally executed anyone.
</P>
<P>
Duch faces life in jail if convicted by the court. Many believe the tribunal is
the last chance to find justice for victims of the regime, which killed up to
two million people.
</P>
<P>
The court was formed in 2006 after nearly a decade of wrangling between the
United Nations and the Cambodian government, and is expected next year to begin
the trial of four other senior Khmer Rouge leaders also in detention.

Russia creating 'explosive' atmosphere in Georgia: ICG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TBILISI, June 22, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian moves to force foreign observers from Georgia's rebel regions are
creating a "potentially explosive" atmosphere that could spark new fighting, a
leading think tank warned in a report Monday.
</P>
<P>
Russia's veto of the extension of a UN mission in Abkhazia and its efforts to
bar an Organisation for (OSCE) mission from South Ossetia "are blows to regional
security that will fuel tensions," said the Brussels-based International Crisis
Group.
</P>
<P>
"Russian diplomatic pressure is dismantling the critical international conflict
resolution machinery in Georgia, leaving the region facing a potentially
explosive situation in which even a small incident could spark new fighting,"
said the group.
</P>
<P>
The ICG urged Moscow to rethink its policy of refusing international
organisations access to Abkhazia and South Ossetia unless they followed Russia's
lead in recognising the regions as independent states.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's actions have created a hugely hazardous atmosphere," ICG's Caucasus
project director, Lawrence Sheets said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow needs to review its policy and work for a reasonable compromise allowing
the UN and Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) monitors to continue their
important work."
</P>
<P>
The group called on Russia to abide by an European Union-brokered ceasefire by
withdrawing its troops to positions held prior to last year's war with Georgia
and by allowing an EU monitoring mission access to rebel regions.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France, Germany and the United States last week condemned Russia's
decision to veto the extension of the UN observer mission in Georgia, created in
1993 to oversee a ceasefire between Tblisi and separatists in Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE's mission in South Ossetia expires on June 30 and some OSCE members
have accused Russia of impeding talks on its extension with its insistence that
on recognition for South Ossetia independence.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent troops deep into Georgia in August 2008 to beat back a Georgian
military attempt to retake South Ossetia, a territory which had received
extensive backing from Moscow for years.
</P>
<P>
Russian forces later mostly withdrew to within South Ossetia and Abkhazia, where
Moscow has since installed thousands of troops.

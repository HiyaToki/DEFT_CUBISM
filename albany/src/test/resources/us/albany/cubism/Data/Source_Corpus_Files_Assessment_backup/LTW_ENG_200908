Google CEO Leaving Apple Board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apple said Monday that Google chief executive Eric Schmidt was resigning
from its board to avoid potential conflicts as the two companies become
greater rivals.
</P>
<P>
The move comes as the Silicon Valley giants face increased scrutiny by
federal regulators who have pushed aggressively in recent months for more
competition in the high-tech and telecommunications industries. Regulators
are investigating the board ties between Google and Apple, hiring practices
by competing tech companies and a settlement Google struck with authors and
book publishers over the rights to digital books.
</P>
<P>
Apple chief executive Steve Jobs said the company and Schmidt mutually
agreed that the Google executive should step down now that competition is
heating up between the companies over Internet browser, handheld and
computer software.
</P>
<P>
Jobs said in a news release that Schmidt's effectiveness on the board,
which he has served on for three years, "will be significantly diminished
since he will have to recuse himself from even larger portions of our
meetings due to potential conflicts of interest."
</P>
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission said that while it commends Google and
Apple for "recognizing that sharing directors raises competitive issues," it
is still investigating remaining board ties between the companies. The
former chief executive of biotech firm Genentech, Arthur Levinson, also sits
on both boards.
</P>
<P>
Apple has been a rare star in the economic downturn, buoyed by sales of
the iconic iPod and iPhone. But its success has come as it has tightly
controlled which applications can be loaded on its iPhone and which
companies can sell the handset. Apple has an exclusive pact with
AT&amp;T.
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress and the Federal Communications Commission have
questioned whether such practices edge out competitors and leave consumers
with fewer choices in mobile technology. For instance, the FCC sent letters
to Apple and AT&amp;T on Friday demanding to know why the firms removed
Google's voice application, which competes with AT&amp;T's service, from the
iPhone.
</P>
<P>
"Apple is a very impressive and very innovative company, and it has some
unique ways of doing things that may be partly responsible for its success
but may have also laid the foundation for its problems," said Ed Black,
president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, an
industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of concerns over Apple's practices is a debate over
so-called "open" and "closed" approaches to technology development by
high-tech firms, as network operators such as AT&amp;T, Verizon and Comcast
have fought against new regulations that would diminish their control over
their communications networks, legal scholars and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
President Barack Obama has supported the idea of network neutrality,
saying during the election campaign that Internet users "must be free to
access content, to use applications and to attach personal devices." FCC
Chairman Julius Genachowski said in a recent interview that he will push for
more competition by promoting the role of startups and "edge" companies that
are creating new applications.

Coal Group Reveals 6 More Forged Lobbying Letters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 12 forged letters -- all appearing to come from local groups
unhappy with a climate-change bill -- were sent to three congressional
offices this summer by a Washington lobbying firm, according to the pro-coal
group for which the firm was working.
</P>
<P>
That is six more fraudulent letters than were previously known to have
been sent by the firm, Bonner and Associates. The newly revealed letters
were sent to Reps. Chris Carney, D-Pa., and Kathy Dahlkemper, D-Pa.,
according to the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, the trade
group that hired Bonner and Associates.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a spokeswoman for Rep. Tom Perriello, D-Va., said his office
had received six fake letters, purporting to be from a Latino
social-services group and NAACP members in his district.
</P>
<P>
Bonner and Associates bills itself as one of Washington's premier firms
for grass-roots lobbying, which often involves eliciting phone calls,
letters or e-mails from constituents or groups in a particular congressional
district.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the firm was denounced by both the pro-coal group, whose
president said it was outraged, and by the Hawthorn Group, an Alexandria,
Va.-based public affairs firm that hired Bonner as a subcontractor in
June.
</P>
<P>
Harvey Valentine, a spokesman for the Hawthorn Group, said it had been
told that Bonner officials would check all letters before they were sent to
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
"It turns out that the quality-control mechanisms took place, but after
(the letters) went to the Hill," Valentine said. "We were furious about
this." He said Hawthorn had fired Bonner and Associates and had not yet paid
it for its work.
</P>
<P>
Jack Bonner, the founder of Bonner and Associates, denied that he firm
was fired and said it finished its work under the contract. In an e-mail
message Tuesday, he said that the letters were written by a "temporary
employee who worked for us for 7 days (who) acted alone" and that "it was
through our quality control effort that we found the problem and fired the
employee on the same day we discovered it."
</P>
<P>
This saga of modern Washington -- in which an "American coalition"
claiming 200,000 supporters still relies on a subcontractor to gin up
favorable letters -- was set off by debate in the House over the climate
bill.
</P>
<P>
The House legislation, since adopted, called for a reduction in U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions, but the pro-coal group was worried this would
drive the price of electric power too high. It wanted Congress, among other
things, to impose price limits. And it wanted other people to say so,
too.
</P>
<P>
"Hawthorn was charged to find -- could we go out and find some of these
community groups," that might also object to higher electric prices, said
Joe Lucas, a spokesman for the pro-coal group.
</P>
<P>
On the coal group's behalf, Hawthorn hired Bonner and Associates. In
all, the coal group estimated, Bonner and Associates was responsible for 46
or 47 letters that were sent to Congress.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, officials at the pro-coal group said they had sought to speak
with all the groups whose names were forged, as well as all three
congressional offices that received the letters. The House Select Committee
on Energy Independence and Global Warming has said it would investigate the
letters.
</P>
<P>
The climate bill approved by the House did not include the price
guarantee the pro-coal group had sought. Legislation is still pending in the
Senate. In the House, Perriello voted for the bill. Both Dahlkemper and
Carney voted against it. A spokesman for Carney did not respond to calls for
comment by Tuesday afternoon. A spokesman for Dahlkemper said the letters
"did not have undue influence" on her decision.

Mexico's War on Civil Rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When President Barack Obama goes to Guadalajara, Mexico, this weekend 
for the North American Leaders Summit, he will surely praise Mexican
President Felipe Calderon  for the courage he has displayed fighting the war
on drugs. The applause is well deserved. Calderon has turned the crackdown
on drug traffickers into the centerpiece of his administration and has
pursued organized crime with undeniable zeal. But before Obama becomes too
effusive and pats Calderon  on the back for a job well done, it's important
that the U.S. president remember the cost and the consequences of his
counterpart's crusade.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico today, human rights violations committed by the military and
the police in this effort are on the rise, yet punishment for the
perpetrators remains elusive. So although Obama should recognize  Calderon's
efforts, he should also insist that drug lawlessness cannot be combated by
breaking the law and that the army must be subjected to the kind of scrutiny
it has shunned so far.
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 45,000 soldiers police the roads of Mexico's main
cities and drug-producing areas as part of a strategy designed to confront
drug traffickers and contain the violence they wreak. Many ring leaders have
been captured, many drug shipments have been confiscated and many smugglers
have been imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
But violence remains unabated, and the unintended consequences of
Calderon's efforts have become distressingly clear: The number of cases of
human rights violations brought before the Mexican Human Rights Commission
has risen by 600 percent over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The war on drugs is turning into a war on the civilian population that
can't simply be dismissed as collateral damage. Mexico's military is
capturing "capos," but it's also raping, extracting confessions through
torture and detaining people arbitrarily. Crime is begetting more
crime.
</P>
<P>
In light of this, U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., was right this week 
to call "premature"  the U.S. State Department's draft report claiming that
Mexico has fulfilled its human rights obligations under the so-called Merida
Initiative. He is right to remind officials on both sides of the border that
in return for Merida's   $1.4 billion in counter-narcotics aid from the
United States, the Calderon government made promises it has not kept. Key
among these are greater transparency and accountability, and the imperative
that military officers be tried by civilian courts.
</P>
<P>
Time and again, Calderon has resisted these demands, adopting an
increasingly contradictory stance. Calderon stands with his hand
outstretched, asking the U.S. for more support and involvement in the war on
drugs. But he also obstinately defends military exceptionalism regarding the
justice system, decries U.S. intervention in Mexico's internal affairs and
rallies Mexico's political class under the banner of a politically expedient
anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
Calderon wants the helicopters and the military assistance and the money
that the Merida Initiative will disburse without having to abide by the
human rights commitments it contains.
</P>
<P>
So unless the Obama administration insists that those requirements be
met, the Merida Initiative will simply be financing impunity. It will
heighten the climate of fear that deeper binational collaboration sought to
eradicate. It will allow the Mexican military and police forces to do what
they do now: arbitrarily detain people, kill innocent bystanders at army
checkpoints, threaten and abuse alleged suspects, ignore due process while
carrying out arrests and get away with it because Calderon believes they can
and should. In his view, the ends justify the means. As he defiantly stated
in a recent interview: "The worst human rights abuses are those committed by
the drug traffickers."
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Calderon's stance will undermine the cause he so
valiantly espouses. Military abuses that go unsanctioned are weakening
public support for the war on drugs and making it difficult to construct the
rule of law in a country where it functions intermittently.
</P>
<P>
Until Mexico makes real progress where human rights are concerned, the
U.S. Congress should withhold future funding for the Merida Initiative.
Unless Calderon agrees to place military officials who violate human rights
under the jurisdiction of civilian courts, U.S. support will perpetuate the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, when  Obama meets with  Calderon, before putting his Mexican
counterpart on a pedestal, he should remind him of the violations reported
by human rights sources, such as the women raped by the military in
Chihuahua and the family killed at a military checkpoint in 2007 in Sinaloa,
and about the 30 people arrested without a warrant in a church in Michoacan
last weekend.  All of them victims of crimes gone unpunished.
</P>
<P>
So many Mexicans hope that when Obama arrives in Guadalajara for the
summit, he treads firmly and carries a big stick.

BLOOMBERG RULES OUT BID FOR WHITE HOUSE IN 2012
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite renewed speculation about his presidential aspirations,
New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Sunday categorically
ruled out running for the White House in 2012 in an appearance on
"Meet the Press" on NBC.
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg said that he was "not looking at the possibility of
running" and that he would not change his mind even if his
advisers believed he could win.
</P>
<P>
"No way, no how?" the show's host, David Gregory, asked.
</P>
<P>
"No way, no how," Bloomberg repeated.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he was urging his supporters to "cease and
desist" in stirring up talk about his interest in a candidacy,
adding, "But most of this is just because the press wants to have
something to write about."
</P>
<P>
"I want to go out having a reputation as a very good, maybe the
greatest mayor ever," he said.
</P>
<P>
The speculation about Bloomberg's ambitions for a White House
bid flared anew last week when the mayor, speaking in Brooklyn,
disparaged Congress and President Barack Obama for their management
of the economy. While his speech Wednesday sounded campaign-like,
Bloomberg has ruled out a 2012 run many times in the past.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to run for president," he said on Sunday,
adding, "I've got a great job. I'm going to finish out my 1,100
and whatever number of days it is left to go, and I'll leave the
politics to the experts."
</P>
<P>
At several points in the interview, the mayor praised Obama,
saying he deserved more credit, support and patience -- countering
remarks from his speech in Brooklyn and from a recent issue of GQ
magazine, in which Bloomberg suggested that Obama "needs some
better advisers."
</P>
<P>
He added, "He campaigns, 'I'm going to do A,' then he doesn't
do it."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the mayor elaborated on those comments, saying that
the president needed advisers with business experience who could
tell him "what the real world is about."
</P>
<P>
One of those potential advisers was Roger C. Altman, a prominent
Wall Street investment banker and Treasury deputy secretary in the
Clinton administration, who could become the next director of
Obama's National Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg said Altman would "be perfect."
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that Obama deserved praise for working out a deal
with Republican leaders to retain Bush-era tax cuts for two years
and extend unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
"Both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have finally come together to
do something in a bipartisan way," he said.

AUBURN COASTS TO SEC TITLE AND A DATE WITH OREGON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ATLANTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All season, Cam Newton has been college football's
most prominent drama major. But whether it was NCAA investigators
or opposing defenses, Newton has shown an uncanny ability to elude
any obstacles in his path.
</P>
<P>
Newton led Auburn to comeback victories in eight of its first 12
games, but no one came close to catching him in the Southeastern
Conference championship game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With would-be tacklers bouncing off him like mosquitoes off a
bug lamp and receivers who seemed to have acres of open space in
which to run free, Newton and Auburn earned a spot in the Bowl
Championship Series title game with a yawn-inducing 56-17 victory
over South Carolina at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't stop him," South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier
said, adding, "He's almost a one-man show."
</P>
<P>
Newton also cemented his status as the Heisman Trophy and set
the tone for a relatively drama-free day in college football.
Auburn (13-0), ranked No. 1 in the BCS standings, set up a matchup
against No. 2 Oregon (12-0) on Jan. 10 in the national championship
game; the Ducks slogged through a 37-20 victory at Oregon State on
Saturday. The official confirmation of the matchup will come Sunday
when the BCS standings are released.
</P>
<P>
"I think Oregon will play a lot better than we did,
certainly," Spurrier said. "But they do have a chance to win it
all in about a month."
</P>
<P>
After a season filled with hair-raising comebacks and
controversy over an attempt by Newton's father to sell him for six
figures in a pay-for-play scheme, Newton's final on-field salvo
before bowl season was without discernible tension. He passed for
four touchdowns and ran for two others, capping a regular season as
one of the best ever in the tradition-rich SEC. Newton completed 17
of 28 passes for 335 yards and no interceptions, and rushed for 73
yards on 14 carries, and was named the game's Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
His performance will resonate in the SEC, as his six total
touchdowns tied the former Florida quarterback Danny Wuerffel's
performance in the 1996 title game. As the seconds ticked off the
clock, teammates carried Newton on their shoulders amid a throng of
cameras near midfield.
</P>
<P>
"I can say he's probably the best football player I've ever
seen," Auburn coach Gene Chizik said.
</P>
<P>
But, as has become usual, the questions surrounding Newton off
the field still managed to intrude on his performance on it. The
NCAA and Auburn concluded earlier in the week that Newton's father,
Cecil Newton Sr., had attempted to solicit a payment to send his
son to Mississippi State. The NCAA enforcement investigation into
Newton's recruitment is continuing.
</P>
<P>
The only real drama came after the game; Cam Newton had not
spoken to reporters since Nov. 9. He read from a prepared statement
and requested that no questions be asked about the NCAA
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"As I've said before," Newton said, "I've done nothing
wrong."
</P>
<P>
Newton declined to answer a question about whether his father
would be joining him at the Heisman Trophy ceremony. During its
broadcast, CBS reported that Newton's father was not at the game.
</P>
<P>
As the second half kicked off, SEC Commissioner Mike Slive stood
among a group of reporters who appeared to have no interest in
returning to watch the game. With sweat glistening under his white
hair and choosing his words carefully, Slive did his best to
deflect the torrent of criticism that the NCAA has received for
declaring Newton eligible despite his father's actions.
</P>
<P>
Slive knows that conference commissioners are allergic to
controversy, which is why it was so surprising that Jim Delany of
the Big Ten, Larry Scott of the Pacific-10 and John Swofford of the
Atlantic Coast Conference all pointedly criticized Newton's case.
</P>
<P>
"I try to concentrate on my own league," Slive said. "And you
can try and make this into a fight. I'm going to focus on my league
and what we have to do and take care of our business."
</P>
<P>
The off-field issues proved more interesting than the game,
which Auburn essentially sealed on the final play of the first
half. After South Carolina cut the Auburn lead to 21-14 with 16
seconds left, the Gamecocks squibbed the kickoff after a
miscommunication. Two plays later, Newton delivered the latest
defining highlight in a season full of them. He hit Darvin Adams
for a 51-yard touchdown pass as time expired, the highlight of
Adams's SEC-title-game-record 217 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
"That didn't cost us the game," Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
Not being able to stop Newton ultimately cost South Carolina.
From a play-action Statue of Liberty play on the opening drive
until he left the field to a standing ovation in the fourth
quarter, Newton dominated the game.
</P>
<P>
Be it opposing defenses or the NCAA, Cam Newton just keeps on
running.

' WHO? '  IS WHAT THEY ' RE SAYING
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the announcement came that Florida athletic director Jeremy
Foley had hired Texas defensive coordinator Will Muschamp, a
39-year-old with no head coaching experience, to replace Urban
Meyer, some Gators fans had to head to the Internet to find out who
he is.
</P>
<P>
But one day later, Muschamp's hiring is being greeted with
enthusiasm by most and guarded optimism by others.
</P>
<P>
A glimpse of what's being said now about the new coach:
</P>
<P>
Argie Radics, Gator booster and Pinellas County Gator Club
member:
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard, it was like 'Who?' Then we were all online
and on the message boards and we started doing some research. I
think it's an excellent hire in that Will has obviously proven
himself at LSU, Auburn and at Texas. He was the coach-in-waiting to
Mack Brown, one of the giants in the business, so that tells us
he's ready. He's fiery and passionate, and we definitely need that
right now."
</P>
<P>
Gigi Pelosi-Farrell, president of Tampa Gator Club:
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great. Time will tell of course, but I think it's
going to be exciting. A little bit of change might be good for us;
from an offensive-minded coach to a defensive-minded one. I think
Jeremy Foley was very bold with this. I didn't know of this man. I
started researching him, and I'm impressed with what I've seen. I
think we need something that isn't the same (established coaches).
The way our year has gone, we need something to shake us up. I hope
he's as good as he was as an assistant coach, maybe even better."
</P>
<P>
Kirk Bohls, Austin (Texas) American-Statesman:
</P>
<P>
"Turned out Will Muschamp wasn't the head coach-in-waiting
after all. He's now the head coach-in-absentia. One of the biggest
gambles in Mack Brown's storied tenure at Texas backfired Saturday
when the fist-pumping, chest-bumping defensive coordinator tired of
waiting for his turn at the top and headed to Florida in a shocking
move. Texas never should have agreed to the risky setup. It ended
badly at Florida State, where Bobby Bowden tried to cling to his
job too long and was forced out, and it ended poorly in Austin,
where Brown faces upheaval among his coaching staff.  There might
not be many greener pastures than Texas, but Florida might be one
of them, and it's easy to see Muschamp lusting after what is one of
the top-five programs in the country. Muschamp will find one huge
problem in that he has to replace a legend in Urban Meyer, but
then, he was prepared to do that here."
</P>
<P>
S. Daniel Ponce, member of Florida's University Athletic
Association board of directors:
</P>
<P>
"I applaud Jeremy on his decision. At first I was surprised by
the hire, but the more I thought about it, I thought what great
potential.  He's young, dynamic, and we can build from here."
</P>
<P>
Jack Youngblood, former Gators All-America defensive lineman and
NFL Hall of Famer, in a Sporting News interview:
</P>
<P>
"He's got his hands full, that's for sure. He knows what he's
walking into. The expectations are already set. That bar is there.
He's going to have to rise to that bar or else it will be a short
tenure."
</P>
<P>
David Nelson, former Florida and current Buffalo Bills WR:
</P>
<P>
" Anyone with the word 'Champ' in their name has to be a
winner, right?"
</P>
<P>
Bill Connelly, ESPN Football Outsiders:
</P>
<P>
"As with draft picks and recruiting classes, we pass judgment
on new coaching hires from the moment the announcement is made (and
often before), and the Internet certainly has collected a variety
of opinions to date. (Smart hire! Panic move!) This is unfortunate,
as there is almost nothing in the world less certain than hiring a
new football coach. "

AUDIT BACKS VISION QUEST IN A FIGHT OVER $100,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau
</P>
<P>
TALLAHASSEE  When the state Department of Health demanded that a
nonprofit vendor refund more than $100,000 in questionable expenses
to Florida taxpayers, the company protested, and a new audit backs
the company's position.
</P>
<P>
Florida's Vision Quest of Orange City, which provides eyeglasses
and vision screenings for low-income children statewide, was hired
in 2005 and got two three-year contracts.
</P>
<P>
State funds have been appropriated every year  more than
$660,000 in the current budget. But the Department of Health has
steered most of that money to another vendor and is paying Vision
Quest $160,808 to serve four counties: Volusia, Lake, Orange and
Seminole.
</P>
<P>
The new vendor, Florida Heiken Children's Vision Program, is
operated by the Miami Lighthouse for the blind. Department of
Health spokesman Rob Hayes said it was chosen over Vision Quest
following a competitive negotiation process last fall.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a Health Department report tallied $102,647 in Vision
Quest expenses deemed unauthorized, including travel to a
conference in Las Vegas, the forgiveness of a loan and payments to
Hebrock Steiner, a Tallahassee lobbying firm.
</P>
<P>
The company rebutted the allegations point by point and insisted
it did nothing wrong. Some legislators wanted the company fired,
but it remained under contract to the state even as it refused to
submit a refund.
</P>
<P>
To break the stalemate, the Department of Health hired the
auditing firm of Law, Redd, Crona &amp; Monroe of Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
The firm's 12-page report noted that the contract between Vision
Quest and the state did not require the firm to remit any excess
expenses. Auditors also found the state did not cite any problems
with the eligibility or number of clients served, and that the firm
kept its overhead low by obtaining donated services from
optometrists, saving taxpayers money. In one year, the audit found,
the company spent $416,000 from grants it received, over and above
state funds.
</P>
<P>
"The results of our evaluation indicate that there was no basis
in the two contracts between FVQ (Florida's Vision Quest) and DOH
(Department of Health) that would impose a liability upon FVQ to
return any of the questioned costs identified by the DOH monitoring
report," the audit said.
</P>
<P>
"Their methodology was so flawed," said Vision Quest executive
director Nancy Jeppesen. "They cherry-picked expenditures they
didn't like, but did not look at the total amount that was spent on
the program."
</P>
<P>
Vision Quest attorney Tim Cerio said the state's review of the
company was "a very inaccurate and unfortunate contract monitoring
review." He said Jeppesen "spends a lot more on this program than
what she gets in state funding. She's going out and raising private
money."
</P>
<P>
Rep. Denise Grimsley, R-Lake Placid, the incoming chairman of
the House Appropriations Committee, said the state agency owes
lawmakers an explanation.
</P>
<P>
"The department has just not been responsive. It's an ongoing
problem with the Department of Health," Grimsley said.
</P>
<P>
"We're at the end of an administration," she added, referring
Rick Scott replacing Gov. Charlie Crist after Jan. 4. "Hopefully
the new administration will review all these contracts and we can
reach some sort of an agreement."
</P>
<P>
Vision Quest employs seven people at its Volusia County offices.
It was created in Orange County in 1994 and soon expanded into a
statewide venture. For more than a decade, the firm's mobile unit
has traveled around the state providing eye exams and eyeglasses to
children, except in Miami-Dade County, where the Miami Lighthouse
for the Blind's Heiken program offers the services.

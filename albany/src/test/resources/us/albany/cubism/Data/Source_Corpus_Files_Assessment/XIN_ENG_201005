Roundup: Israeli attack on aid ships draws condemnation in Egypt
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CAIRO, May 31 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Egypt condemned on Monday Israeli forces' military attack on the Gaza-bound aid
convoy Freedom Flotilla.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, currently in the French southern city of Nice
to attend the 25th Africa-France Summit, denounced the use of force by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Israeli forces attacked the international convoy of aid ships
when attempting to stop the flotilla from reaching Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The flotilla, consisting of six ships carrying about 10,000 tons of aid, set
sail from a port in Cyprus on Sunday and was scheduled to reach Gaza on Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Up to 19 civilians were killed in the deadly showdown between Israeli navy and
pro-Palestinian activists onboard the Gaza-bound aid flotilla, Israel's Channel
10 said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Ministry also condemned the attack.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli authorities have used excessive power and killed a number of activists.
Egypt condemns this and totally rejects it," spokesman for the Foreign Ministry
Hossam Zaki said in televised statements.
</P>
<P>
"We extend our deepest sympathies to the families of the human rights activists
who lost their lives today in support of the Palestinian people and their just
cause," he added.
</P>
<P>
The senior Egyptian diplomat called for immediate lifting of the siege imposed
on Gaza, vowing to continue policies aiming at relieving the people in the strip
and facilitating their crossing in and out.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry also summoned the Israeli ambassador in Cairo to
convey its objection to the attack.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli ambassador to Egypt has been summoned and informed of Egypt's
condemnation over the killings and the excessive use of force against the
international activists," Zaki said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian parliament also denounced the attack as a crime that violates the
international law.
</P>
<P>
In statements aired by the Cairo-based Nile News TV, Ahmed Fathi Sorour, the
speaker of Egypt's People's Assembly (lower house of parliament), described the
attack as one of a series of international crimes committed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
"What has been committed by Israel is an international crime by all means... it
(Israel) trod all the international norms and values and looks down upon all
other countries of the world because if the world was strong it could have
deterred Israel from indulging in this international criminality," Sorour said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based Arab League (AL) strongly condemned the Israeli attack and
called on the international community to move as quickly as possible to stop
what it described as Israeli acts of terrorism that cause unrest in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The AL secretary general has called for an urgent meeting that will be held
tomorrow (Tuesday)...to take the suitable action," AL Deputy Secretary General
Ahmed bin Helli said in televised statements.
</P>
<P>
Around 4,000 Egyptians gathered in the Egyptian city of Fayyoum, south of Cairo,
urging the Arab leaders to take firm stance against Israel, the Doha-based al-
Jazeera TV said.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of political activists and opposition figures staged a demonstration in
downtown Cairo urging the Arab countries to sever ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The protestors, who gathered before the headquarters of the Foreign Ministry,
called on the government to oust the Israeli ambassador in Cairo.

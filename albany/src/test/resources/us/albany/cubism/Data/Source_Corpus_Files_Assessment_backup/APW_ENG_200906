Federer aims to claim 6th Wimbledon, 15th major

Roger Federer is building something of a reputation as an on-court crier, and he remembers well the first time he wept after winning a match.
</P>
<P>
It was July 2, 2001, at Wimbledon, the tournament that means more to him than any other. Federer was 19, up-and-coming and making his Centre Court debut in the fourth round when he stunned Pete Sampras, who was 29, seeded No. 1 and seeking an eighth Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
"I used to cry almost after every single match I lost as a junior. It's not at all a feeling like it's the end of the world -- of course not, because tennis is not everything -- but some people can control it, some people can't," Federer said. "Crying after a victory is something that started when I beat Pete."
</P>
<P>
Back then, Federer had yet to reach the semifinals, let alone win a title, at any Grand Slam event. Eight years later, as Wimbledon begins Monday with a roof over Centre Court for the first time, Federer arrives at the All England Club bidding to break Sampras' career record of 14 major championships.
</P>
<P>
And the complexion of Federer's pursuit of a sixth Wimbledon title changed significantly Friday: He doesn't have to worry about dealing with his nemesis, defending champion Rafael Nadal, who withdrew from the tournament because of bad knees.
</P>
<P>
Nadal's exit was the talk of the grounds Saturday, and Federer called it "very disappointing for the tournament, and also for myself."
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate. I'm sad for him, because it must have been a very difficult decision to make," Federer said. "I'd love to play him. He's my main rival. We've had some wonderful matches over the years, and especially the one here last year was the one that obviously stands out."
</P>
<P>
Ah, yes, last year, when Nadal reduced Federer to tears by winning the longest singles final in tournament history, a 4-hour, 48-minute test of skill and will that ended 9-7 in the fifth set as darkness descended.
</P>
<P>
That 2008 setback ended Federer's streaks of 40 consecutive wins at Wimbledon and 65 in a row on grass, and he is ready to start anew.
</P>
<P>
"The focus is on the first round -- and the first point," Federer said. "Trying to regain my Wimbledon crown, I guess, stands over trying to beat Pete's record right now."
</P>
<P>
There was something apt about the way Federer tied Sampras' Grand Slam mark by completing a career Grand Slam at the French Open, a tournament the American never won and that the Swiss star came so close to winning, year after year, before finally breaking through this month.
</P>
<P>
There also would be something fitting if Federer surpasses Sampras at Wimbledon, a tournament that means so much to both men -- and where their paths crossed all those years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel like I have extra pressure now having to win the tournament or trying to. I mean, anyway, there's a lot of weight off my shoulders since Paris," Federer said. "So I'm entering tournaments, I guess, a little bit more relaxed these days."
</P>
<P>
On the day Federer won at Roland Garros, Sampras said he expected Federer to get No. 15 "in the next couple of weeks." Asked whether he would travel to the All England Club this year, Sampras replied: "We'll sort of see what happens."
</P>
<P>
Many current players figure Federer is set to re-establish his supremacy at Wimbledon. As 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt put it: "Roger's going to be the one to beat."
</P>
<P>
The same must be said of the Williams sisters, particularly Venus. As has been the case with Federer in recent years, Wimbledon is their turf.
</P>
<P>
Venus has played in seven finals at the All England Club, winning five championships, including the past two. Serena has played in four finals, winning two.
</P>
<P>
Pay no heed to the rankings, which have both sisters behind No. 1 Dinara Safina. Here are the numbers that really matter: Serena has won 10 Grand Slam titles overall, and Venus seven, while Marat Safin's little sister is 0-3 in major finals.
</P>
<P>
Maria Sharapova, the 2004 Wimbledon champion, can't be counted out, even if her serve has been a trouble spot in her return from shoulder surgery, while a teenager such as Victoria Azarenka or Caroline Wozniacki -- who won a grass-court title at Eastbourne on Saturday -- could be ready for a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
It seems far less likely that someone who isn't a household name will win the men's championship July 5.
</P>
<P>
For Federer, there are other laurels at stake this fortnight: He could match Nadal's feat from 2008 of winning the French Open and Wimbledon in the same season -- that hadn't been done since Bjorn Borg in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Plus, Federer can reclaim the No. 1 ranking, although he said that doesn't concern him.
</P>
<P>
Right now, he is focusing on adding to his haul of major championships. He bawled during the postmatch ceremonies after another five-set setback against Nadal at the Australian Open this year, then shed tears of joy when he won the French Open.
</P>
<P>
Now comes Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
"I do think I'm the favorite, actually, with the success I've had and how close I came again last year," said Federer, whose wife is due to give birth to their first child this summer. "Without any disrespect to any of the other players -- because I think this year's field is going to be very difficult to topple."
</P>
<P>
Those words were spoken before Nadal became only the second Wimbledon men's champion in 35 years to decide not to defend his title.
</P>
<P>
Federer said the rivals chatted briefly Wednesday, and Nadal congratulated him for winning the French Open.
</P>
<P>
"I asked him how his knee was. He was, like, 'It's OK.' So I kind of knew it wasn't great, because he's very honest to me," Federer said. "So I knew something could be coming up."
</P>
<P>
Federer had other men in mind, too, such as Andy Murray, the 22-year-old from Scotland who gives local fans a real chance for the first British male champion at the All England Club since Fred Perry in 1936.
</P>
<P>
Murray reached his first Grand Slam final at last year's U.S. Open, and he showed how his versatility is growing by making the French Open quarterfinals. Then, as if the expectations and pressure weren't going to be onerous enough during Wimbledon, Murray went out and won the grass-court tournament at Queen's Club last weekend, making him that event's first British champion since 1938.
</P>
<P>
"The buildup beforehand is a little bit more stressful than other tournaments," Murray said, "but once it starts, it's like all the other Slams."
</P>
<P>
In running down the list of contenders, Federer also named two-time Wimbledon finalist Andy Roddick (although that was before the American hurt his foot at Queen's Club), 2008 Australian Open runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and French Open runner-up Robin Soderling, who ended Nadal's 31-match winning streak at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
Still -- and especially with Nadal out -- it all comes back to Federer, even as far as he is concerned.
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I've got the game, I've got the mental approach and I've got the experience ... to win at Wimbledon many more times," Federer said. "But I'd like to get this one, this year."

Poland honors John Paul II with monument in Warsaw
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WARSAW, Poland 2009-06-06 15:26:17 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poland on Saturday marked the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's first pilgrimage to his homeland, unveiling a giant cross monument in central Warsaw in honor of the late Polish-born pontiff.
</P>
<P>
The 30-foot (nine-meter) tall white granite cross stands on the site where John Paul II delivered a Mass in 1979 in then-communist Poland. The sermon is credited by many with inspiring the country's nascent pro-democracy groups and giving rise to the Solidarity freedom movement that helped topple communist rule in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"We Poles know that the overthrow of communism did not start in 1989 but 10 years earlier, here on this square with the words of John Paul II," Warsaw mayor Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz told the thousands of faithful who attended the ceremony and later Mass.
</P>
<P>
"From today forward, in the heart of Poland and Warsaw ... will stand a cross that is a symbol of the faith, perseverance and hope."
</P>
<P>
Warsaw Archbishop Kazimierz Nycz also recited a short prayer and blessed the monument with holy water.
</P>
<P>
John Paul II, who died in 2005, is still a highly revered figure in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
The pontiff's encouragement to his countrymen of peaceful challenge to the communist regime is credited by many with hastening its demise. This year's anniversary of his first pilgrimage comes as Poland also celebrates the 20th anniversary of the country's first partly free elections that marked the end of communist rule.

Japan fans to submit Valentine petition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fans supporting Bobby Valentine have gathered 100,000 signatures on a petition seeking to keep the American as manager of the Chiba Lotte Marines beyond the 2009 Japanese baseball season.
</P>
<P>
The group said in a press release Friday it will submit the petition at the head offices of the Marines on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The signatures were gathered outside Lotte's home stadium in Chiba where Marines fans have been holding demonstrations in support of the popular former New York Mets manager.
</P>
<P>
Valentine, in his seventh season as manager of the Marines, had been told his contract will not be renewed at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
Fans in the right field seats at Chiba Marine Stadium wear T-shirts saying "Bobby 2010" and wave huge signs with slogans like "No Bobby, No Marines," and "Always Behind Bobby."
</P>
<P>
Team president Ryuzo Setoyama announced in the offseason that the team couldn't afford Valentine after this season.
</P>
<P>
Valentine, 59, led the team to the Japan Series championship in 2005 and has been a fan favorite since.

Tiananmen 20th anniversary brings new repression
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING 2009-06-04 13:27:19 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China aggressively deterred dissent in the capital on Thursday's 20th anniversary of the crackdown on democracy activists in Tiananmen Square. But tens of thousands turned out for a candlelight vigil in Hong Kong to mourn the hundreds, possibly thousands, of demonstrators killed.
</P>
<P>
The central government ignored calls from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and even Taiwan's China-friendly president for Beijing to face up to the 1989 violence.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, foreign journalists were barred from the vast square as uniformed and plainclothes police stood guard across the area, which was the epicenter of the student-led movement that was crushed by the military on the night of June 3-4, 1989.
</P>
<P>
Security officials checking passports also blocked foreign TV camera operators and photographers from entering the square to cover the raising of China's national flag, which happens at dawn every day. Plainclothes officers confronted journalists on the streets surrounding the square, cursing and threatening violence against them.
</P>
<P>
The repression on the mainland contrasted starkly with Hong Kong, where organizers said 150,000 people gathered in the city's famous Victoria Park in the largest commemoration on Chinese soil. Police had no immediate crowd estimate.
</P>
<P>
A former British colony, the territory has retained its own legal system and open society since reverting to Chinese rule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for China to take responsibility for the killings," said Kin Cheung, a 17-year-old Hong Kong student. "They need to tell the truth."
</P>
<P>
On the mainland, government censors shut down social networking and image-sharing Web sites such as Twitter and Flickr and blacked out CNN and other foreign news channels each time they aired stories about Tiananmen.
</P>
<P>
Dissidents and families of crackdown victims were confined to their homes or forced to leave Beijing, part of sweeping efforts to prevent online debate or organized commemorations of the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"We've been under 24-hour surveillance for a week and aren't able to leave home to mourn. It's totally inhuman," said Xu Jue, whose son was 22 when he was shot in the chest by soldiers and bled to death on June 4, 1989.
</P>
<P>
Officers and police cars were also stationed outside the home of Wang Yannan, the daughter of Zhao Ziyang, the Communist Party leader deposed for sympathizing with the pro-democracy protesters, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy. Wang heads an auction firm and has never been politically active.
</P>
<P>
In a further sign of the government's intransigence, the second most-wanted student leader from 1989 was forced to return to Taiwan on Thursday after flying to the Chinese territory of Macau the day before in an attempt to return home.
</P>
<P>
Wu'er Kaixi, in exile since fleeing China after the crackdown, told The Associated Press by phone he was held overnight at the Macau airport's detention center and that being denied entry on the Tiananmen anniversary was a "tragedy."
</P>
<P>
The student leader who topped the most-wanted list, Wang Dan, was jailed for seven years before being expelled to the United States in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Clinton said in a statement Wednesday that China, as an emerging global power, "should examine openly the darker events of its past and provide a public accounting of those killed, detained or missing, both to learn and to heal."
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou urged China to lift the taboo on discussing the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
"This painful chapter in history must be faced. Pretending it never happened is not an option," Ma said in a statement issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang attacked Clinton's comments as a "gross interference in China's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
"We urge the U.S. to put aside its political prejudice and correct its wrongdoing and refrain from disrupting or undermining bilateral relations," Qin said in response to a question at a regularly scheduled news briefing. Qin refused to comment on the security measures -- or even acknowledge they were in place.
</P>
<P>
"Today is like any other day, stable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has never allowed an independent investigation into the military's crushing of the protests, in which possibly thousands of students, activists and ordinary citizens were killed. Young Chinese know little about the events, having grown up in a generation that has largely eschewed politics in favor of raw nationalism, wealth acquisition and individual pursuits.
</P>
<P>
Authorities tightened surveillance of China's dissident community ahead of the anniversary, with some leading writers under close watch or house arrest for months.
</P>
<P>
Ding Zilin, a retired professor and advocate for Tiananmen victims, said by telephone that a dozen officers have been blocking her and her husband from leaving their Beijing apartment.

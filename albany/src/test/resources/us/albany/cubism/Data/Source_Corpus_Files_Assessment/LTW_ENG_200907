A Charade In Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For years, Natalia Estemirova documented Chechnya's political murders,
kidnappings and other vile human rights abuses committed without fear of
repercussions. She did so after journalist Anna Politkovskaya was slain in
2006, apparently for documenting atrocities in the Russian republic, and
after human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov was killed earlier this year.
Estemirova spent a few months abroad last spring after Chechen President
Ramzan Kadyrov summoned her to a meeting and reportedly threatened her, but
she returned home to continue her work. Until Wednesday. That's when she was
kidnapped in daylight outside her home in the capital of Grozny and executed
by hit men who once again seem to have acted with impunity.

In a move that can only be described as cynical, Kadyrov vowed to
personally oversee the investigation of the murder of the woman he only last
year personally threatened. No, thank you. Kadyrov, who is the Kremlin's man
in Chechnya, also was suspected of involvement in Politkovskaya's slaying,
but he reportedly defended himself then by saying, "I don't kill
women."

Estemirova worked for the nongovernmental Memorial Human Rights Center
of Russia and had been collaborating with the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch
to document extrajudicial killings, house burnings and abductions of
suspected insurgents fighting Kadyrov. In an interview with the Los Angeles
Times' Megan Stack last year, she condemned the "atmosphere of impunity" in
Chechnya that allowed for about 4,000 disappearances to go unsolved or
unpunished.

Chechnya is a republic of Russia, and the Russian government has the
investigative and legal capacity to solve this case, given the political
will. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev must launch a thorough and credible
investigation into Estemirova's killing under the Russian prosecutor general
and with federal rather than local investigators. (Just as he must ensure
that a new trial is held in Politkovskaya's case, as ordered by an appeals
court that last month overturned the acquittals of four men accused of her
murder.) U.S. and European officials must keep a spotlight on these cases
and demand that the murderers be brought to justice. Only then is there any
hope of reducing the violence in Chechnya. Only then will they quit killing
the messengers.

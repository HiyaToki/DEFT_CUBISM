MediaTek Inc., Taiwan's No. 1 handset chip designer, has been awarded a special
prize that encourages industrial firms to improve their achievements in
environmental protection and energy-saving, the organizer of the award said
Tuesday.

The Industrial Sustainable Excellence Award, known as Taiwan's Nobel Prize for
the industrial sector, received 48 entries this year, from which seven winners
were selected, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).

<P>
MediaTek, which was the only winner awarded the special prize, represents the
country's outstanding IC design ability, or "hard power," making it deserving of
the honor, the MOEA said.

"It is gratifying to receive the prize, but it also puts us under pressure, "
said MediaTek Chairman Tsai Ming-kai, who attributed the company's success to
the correct policies of the government.

He also noted that Taiwan is going to have big opportunities in the emerging
markets such as China, India and Southeast Asian countries.

About 1,000 Taiwanese companies have applied for consideration for the award
since it was founded in 2000, 123 of which have been selected as winners and
only nine of which have received the special prize.

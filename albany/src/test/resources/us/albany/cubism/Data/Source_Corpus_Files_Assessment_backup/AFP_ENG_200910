Baseball: Rich Yankees battle champion Phillies for title
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK, Oct 27, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trying to justify their 201 million-dollar payroll with a first title since
2000, the New York Yankees open their bid to dethrone reigning champion
Philadelphia on Wednesday in the 105th World Series.
</P>
<P>
No team has defended the Major League Baseball crown since the Yankees won their
third in a row in 2000, but the Phillies are trying to become the first National
League champion to repeat since Cincinnati in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The Yankees, whose 26 titles make them the most successful club in American pro
sports history, have missed the playoffs only once in the past 15 seasons but
the title drought has raised the stakes for the big-spending Yankees.
</P>
<P>
"When the organization spends so much for a team, I expect nothing less," said
Yankees closing relief pitcher Mariano Rivera of Panama.
</P>
<P>
The Steinbrenner family spent 435 million dollars in contracts before the season
to obtain Mark Teixeira, A.J. Burnett and C.C. Sabathia, who will pitch for New
York against Cliff Lee in game one of the best-of-seven final.
</P>
<P>
"We have to finish what we started," Yankees catcher Jorge Posada said.
</P>
<P>
Posada, Rivera, superstar Derek Jeter and Andy Pettitte, a 37-year-old ace
southpaw pitcher who signed this year for 5.5 million dollars, each won four
crowns with the Yankees, now back in the World Series after a six-year absence.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to come back and help this city win a championship," Pettitte said.
"If I'm not able to, it will be a great disappointment."
</P>
<P>
Standing in the way of the Yankees juggernaut are the Phillies, whose hefty 114
million-dollar team salary has assembled a slugging lineup that includes
powerhouses Jimmy Rollins and Ryan Howard.
</P>
<P>
Phillies shortstop Rollins aroused the ire of the Yankees by boldly predicting
on national television Monday that the Phillies would capture the World Series
in five games.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we're going to win," Rollins said on "The Jay Leno Show". "If we're
nice we'll let it go six, but I'm thinking five - close it out at home."
</P>
<P>
That did not sit well with the Yankees, who own the home-field edge in the
series by virtue of the American League's victory over the National in July's
Major League Baseball All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy is a confident man. He always has been," Sabathia said. "They are the
champs so we have to go take it from them. It's up to us to go prove that we are
better than them.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a battle. It's going to be a fight."
</P>
<P>
Howard sees the Rollins prediction as trying to motivate his teammates ahead of
the championship showdown.
</P>
<P>
"That's just Jimmy. He loves that spotlight," Phillies slugger Ryan Howard said.
"He loves putting that, I don't want to say pressure but, that kind of attention
on himself and on our team.
</P>
<P>
"You know here in Yankee Stadium (New York supporters) are going to be all over
him. And you know what? He wants that. He relishes that."
</P>
<P>
A Series sub-plot for the Yankees will be third baseman Alex Rodriguez, who
reached the championship final for the first time in his 16-year career in a
season that began with humiliating doping revelations.
</P>
<P>
"A-Rod" admitted using steroids from 2001 through 2003 while with the Texas
Rangers then was sidelined for more than a month by hip surgery.
</P>
<P>
But aftr a history of prior playoff failures, Rodriguez has been a playoff star
for New York, hitting .438 with five home runs and driving in 12 runs in the
post-season run.
</P>
<P>
"It started very rough for me in spring training," Rodriguez said. "All I cared
about this year was winning games. I'm so excited to have the opportunity to win
a World Series."

Formula One: Williams to end Toyota engine deal
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, Oct 14, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Williams said Wednesday they are ending their engine supply deal with Japanese
manufacturer Toyota at the end of the season, in an expected announcement that
leaves the British team free to search for a new supplier for 2010.
</P>
<P>
Williams team boss Frank Williams said: "At a time of great difficulty for us as
a team, Toyota stepped forward and agreed to supply us with engines for 2007
through to the end of 2009.
</P>
<P>
"Toyota has been a very decent partner who have always respected our
independence and provided us with a first-rate technical product. We are proud
that we have been able to work with such a great company and we are grateful to
the team in Cologne for their support."
</P>
<P>
Renault and Cosworth have both been linked as possible replacements.
</P>
<P>
Toyota motorsport boss Tadashi Yamashina said: "We have enjoyed a productive
working relationship with Williams and I believe both companies have benefited
from that partnership. We respect the wishes of Williams to look for other
opportunities and wish them well for the future."
</P>
<P>
Brawn GP driver Rubens Barrichello meanwhile revealed he has had talks with
Williams.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't signed with anybody yet. But it's true that I'm talking with Williams
and Brawn," the 37-year-old, who trails championship leader and Brawn team-mate
Jenson Button by 14 points ahead of his home race at Interlagos this weekend,
said in quotes reported by The Guardian newspaper.

Russia's Medvedev praises 'energetic' ties with India
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Moscow, Oct 21, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Wednesday praised his country's ties with
India, a fellow member of the BRIC club of emerging economic giants and a top
market for Russian arms exports.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev touted the "energetic, constructive and wide-ranging political dialogue
which exists between Russia and India" at a meeting in the Kremlin with Indian
Foreign Minister SM Krishna.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was part of preparations for Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's
planned visit to Russia in December.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev said the two countries had cooperated in "joint work against current
threats like terrorism, narco-crime and organised crime" as well in battling the
effects of the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We view Russia as a global power that plays a special role in ensuring peace
and stability, not only in the world at large, but also in our neighbourhood,"
Krishna told Medvedev.
</P>
<P>
Russia has pursued close ties with India, as well as fellow BRIC members Brazil
and China, in its efforts to promote a "multipolar" world order not dominated by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
But Russian-Indian ties have been strained by problems with New Delhi's bid to
buy a Russian aircraft carrier, the Admiral Gorshkov.
</P>
<P>
Delays in the effort to modernise the Soviet-era warship before giving it to
India have embarrassed Moscow and led to price disputes between the countries,
which have had friendly relations dating back to the Cold War.

Victims angry over delay of Karadzic trial
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SARAJEVO, Oct 14, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Survivors of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre expressed outrage Wednesday over a
delay in the trial of Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic, saying
victims awaiting justice are losing patience.
</P>
<P>
"We are outraged with the court's decision. Karadzic is buying time and the
court is letting him do that," Munira Subasic, the head of an association
gathering Srebrenica mothers told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid the court risks that many witnesses may die in the meantime, which
will be a benefit for Karadzic," added Subasic who lost her husband, son and 20
other family members in the massacre.
</P>
<P>
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) decided on
Tuesday to partly uphold Karadzic's appeal against the October 21 starting date
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
But the court rejected his plea for several months to prepare his de fence and
instead insisted Karadzic's trial for genocide, war crimes and crimes against
humanity should start on October 26 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic stands accused of 11 charges for his role in the 1992-95 Bosnian war,
notably for the 44-month siege of Sarajevo that left 10,000 people dead and the
July 1995 massacre of around 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the village of
Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised and worried about the ICTY decision," said Murat Tahirovic, the
head of association gathering Bosnian war time camp inmates.
</P>
<P>
"Let's hope that trial is not going to be delayed for a long period of time," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Subasic said: "It is all part of a dirty game the court is playing for some
time. We have been waiting to see justice is being done for far too long."
</P>
<P>
"Many mothers did not live long enough to see Karadzic behind bars. Many may die
before he is sentenced," she added.

FHockey: Pakistan's Aziz faces ban over cannabis use
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KARACHI, Oct 13, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan hockey forward Tariq Aziz faces a ban of six to 12 months after a
doping test showed he had traces of cannabis in his system, an official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) dropped 28-year-old Aziz from a European
tour planned for last month.
</P>
<P>
Tests proved negative but traces of Carboxy-THC -- a by-product of cannabis --
were still found in his sample.
</P>
<P>
The PHF executive board "will now decide about the punishment as we have zero
tolerance on doping", federation secretary Asif Bajwa said.
</P>
<P>
The board's standard ban for a first-time doping offence is six months to one
year.
</P>
<P>
Bajwa said, however, that the player's use of the drug was likely within
international legal limits laid down by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
</P>
<P>
"As per the WADA rules the threshold limit for the Carboxy-THC is 15 nanograms
per millilitre, but Aziz did not cross that limit and that's why he doesn't come
under WADA punishment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, team coach Shahid Ali Khan said Aziz had taken an unspecified banned
substance because he was "really desperate" to return to the side after his back
trouble.
</P>
<P>
Aziz has a history of disciplinary problems. He was banned for six months by the
PHF after he received a red card for hitting an Australian player with his
hockey stick during the final of the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
That was his second offence in the tournament, having already received a red
card for hitting a South African player during the group phase of the Games.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, three time Olympic and four time world champions, have failed to find
their old form in recent years. The team eventually had to cancel the European
tour after they failed to acquire visas for players.
</P>
<P>
They are due to play the qualifying rounds of next year's World Cup to be held
in the Indian capital New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan feature in the qualifying round in Lille, France from October 31, one
of three rounds to chose the last three teams for the 12-team World Cup.

Canada says Iraqi bombings were 'cruel and unjustified'

<TEXT>
<P>
Canada's foreign affairs minister Sunday condemned the twin suicide bombings in
Baghdad as "cruel and unjustified acts of violence," and offered Iraq Canada's
support in strengthening its democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is appalled and gravely concerned by today's two deadly bomb attacks
in Baghdad...  which took many innocent lives," Lawrence Cannon said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Canada condemns these cruel and unjustified acts of violence. We are confident
that such affronts on the Iraqi people will not weaken the country's strong
desire to establish a secure, stable and unified democracy," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Canada stands firmly with the Iraqi people to help strengthen
freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Iraq," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
At least 99 people were killed and more than 700 injured when two vehicle bombs
blamed on Al-Qaeda exploded on Sunday at the justice ministry and a provincial
office in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
It was Iraq's bloodiest day in more than two years. The government blamed the
strikes on Al-Qaeda and supporters of ex-dictator Saddam Hussein's banned Baath
Party.

New Indonesia stoning law is 'torture': rights group
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Jakarta, Oct 12, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new law mandating death by stoning for adulterers in Indonesia's deeply
Islamic Aceh province advocates "torture" and should be overturned, US-based
group Human Rights Watch said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Stoning and flogging constitute torture in any circumstances," Human Rights
Watch Asia head Elaine Pearson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Imposing these draconian punishments on private, consensual conduct means the
government can dictate people's intimate lives."
</P>
<P>
The law -- which also allows punishments of up to 400 lashes for child rape, 100
lashes for homosexual acts and 60 lashes for gambling -- was passed unanimously
last month by lawmakers in the staunchly Islamic region.
</P>
<P>
It has yet to be approved by the provincial governor and is opposed by the
central government in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The law, based on local interpretations of Islamic or sharia law, is supposed to
replace elements of Indonesia's criminal code.
</P>
<P>
It allows the death penalty for a married person and 100 lashes for an unmarried
person found guilty of adultery.
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Watch urged the central government and a new incoming local
parliament in Aceh to overturn the law.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry spokesman, Teuku Faizasyah, told AFP the law would not come
into effect without the approval of Aceh Governor Irwandi Yusuf, who has stated
his opposition to the law.
</P>
<P>
"Even if local government approves it, if the central government thinks it's not
in line with national law, the central government can ask it to overturn or
annul the law," he said,
</P>
<P>
"The central government wants to make it clear that the law and legislation at
the provincial level should not in any way contradict the law and legislation
promulgated at the national level."
</P>
<P>
Aceh had previously adopted a milder form of sharia law in 2001 as part of an
autonomy package from Jakarta aimed at quelling separatist sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of Indonesia's 234 million people are Muslim, but the country
also has significant Hindu, Buddhist, Christian and Confucian minorities. Most
local Muslims practise a moderate form of the religion.

BRONCOS '  DAWKINS RETURNS TO A CITY AND FANS HE CARED SO MUCH FOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PHILADELPHIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They would applaud the intensity from the upper
decks. And they would honor the consistency of performance from 6
feet under.
</P>
<P>
Dead or alive, Philly fans love Brian Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
"I've been blessed to sign -- I don't know if I should say
blessed -- but I've been asked to sign jerseys for people's loved
ones who died and want to be buried with one of my jerseys," said
Dawkins, who is in his first season as the Broncos' strong safety
after playing 13 years as a free safety for the Eagles. "I've been
booed, absolutely. But if you stay strong and persevere, Philly
fans will welcome you into their home."
</P>
<P>
And coffins. Take another second to think about this. Dawkins, a
man of deep faith and the courage to proclaim it, signing for the
dead.
</P>
<P>
"Many, many times," he said. "So I understand their psyche.
What Philly people want from their athletes is they want you to
care as much as they care."
</P>
<P>
After 13 seasons, seven Pro Bowls, a franchise-record 183 games
and 109 overall wins with the Eagles, Dawkins left Philadelphia for
a Broncos team that more strongly believed he could continue to
play at an elite level, if at a modified position.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Dawkins returns to Philly, where the Broncos will
play the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field, a place that figures to
have its share of No. 20 jerseys sprinkled among the sold-out
crowd.
</P>
<P>
The Broncos will enter the game as considerable underdogs,
although in Dawkins there is hope. Maybe Dawkins, perhaps the
first-ever new kid on the block to immediately become leader of the
Dove Valley neighborhood, can inspire his Broncos teammates to
bring their "A" game today.
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't said too much about it," said Champ Bailey, the
Broncos' star cornerback. "I think he understands the importance
of this game for the team."
</P>
<P>
To Dawkins' credit, he has made sure his special moment doesn't
stray into distraction. His Philly-area home has been sold and, as
of Thursday evening, he still hadn't decided whether to fly his
wife, Connie, and four children out for the game.
</P>
<P>
His free hours at the team's hotel Saturday evening would not be
spent visiting with longtime friends. No disrespect. But there's a
reason why the NFL has an offseason.
</P>
<P>
Dawkins knows this game is bigger than him. His 8-6 Broncos have
slipped to a win-or- else AFC playoff predicament against a 10-4
Eagles team that has scored more points than the Indianapolis Colts
and already clinched an NFC playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a 'win one for the Gipper,' " Dawkins said. "We
need this game for us. Obviously, going back to where I grew up as
a professional player, I would love to win this game. But it's not
for anything other than the Denver Broncos need this game. Kyle
(Orton) needs this game. B-Marsh needs this game. I don't want guys
to think during this week I'm going to be more intense than I
already am for a game."
</P>
<P>
On the same day Dawkins was introduced at a news conference as
the Broncos' new safety, word spread of how Broncos coach Josh
McDaniels had engaged in preliminary trade discussions involving
star quarterback Jay Cutler.
</P>
<P>
It would be a while before Denver realized Feb. 28 was not a
dark day for bringing the eventual end to Cutler, but a glorious
day for marking the beginning of Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
Ryan McBean came to fully appreciate Dawkins' arrival during the
summer as the Broncos' 297-pound defensive end was horseback riding
along a trail near the famous Hollywood sign outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Among his riding group was a couple from Philly.
</P>
<P>
"We started talking about Dawkins," McBean said. "The more
they talked about it, the angrier they got. They started getting
mad at me. 'Why did you take Brian Dawkins?' Like I was the one
that brought him here. I was just smiling. And the lady gave me a
look like she wanted to kill (me). I had never heard of a player
having that much impact."
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, Philly fans are difficult to please. They get a
little tired of hearing about this, but too bad -- since that
December day 41 years ago when they angrily booed Santa Claus while
pelting him with snowballs, Philadelphia has lived with its
reputation as having the most irascible fandom in sports.
</P>
<P>
Local athletes think the Denver market is critical? Philly fans
booed their native son Kobe Bryant at the 2002 NBA All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
Name some of the all-time Philadelphia sports greats. Richie
Allen. Mike Schmidt. Donovan McNabb. Eric Lindros. They've all
suffered the wrath from their local faithful.
</P>
<P>
And yet, these same demanding Philly fans came to adore Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's because he played at a high level," said Broncos
running back Correll Buckhalter, who has his own homecoming week
stir after he spent the previous eight years as Dawkins' teammate
in Philly. "I mean, he's Hall of Fame-caliber."
</P>
<P>
No doubt, Dawkins' play is a major reason why he captured the
hearts from the City of Brotherly Love. In this way, Philadelphia
is like every other city -- fans aren't going to waste emotions
falling for backup blockers.
</P>
<P>
But as McNabb, the Eagles' quarterback, and Schmidt, the
Phillies' greatest slugger, can attest, Philly fans are acutely
aware of a player's intangibles.
</P>
<P>
"Brian plays every play like it is the last play," Eagles
coach Andy Reid said. "That's what you love about him."
</P>
<P>
Almost always, when a favorite player leaves via free agency,
which was how Dawkins wound up in Denver, the former team can feel
jilted. Resentful. It was different in Philly. One Eagles' employee
got fired for posting online his disappointment in the team for
allowing Dawkins to get away.
</P>
<P>
The Eagles are expected to make the classy gesture today of
introducing the Denver defensive players as part of their pregame
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
And Dawkins, whose remarkable, even frightening passion
translates to a seeming unconscious showmanship in the minutes
leading up to kickoff, will have been welcomed home.
</P>
<P>
"What I expect is a very, very loud atmosphere," Dawkins said.
"Because we appreciate one another. They're going to cheer me, I
believe, but probably not all. I know this, when the ball is
snapped, guess who they're going to root for?"
</P>
<P>
The team may always be Philly's true love. But from the graves
below and heavens above, Dawkins will not be without support.

30 YEARS LATER, MEMORIES OF GARDEN ' S SHOE BRAWL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Catherine Kaptain turned on the evening news and saw her
son John being struck with his own shoe in a fight with the Boston
Bruins, her disdain for the sport her family loved never seemed
more justified. "I screamed, 'They're beating up my babies!"' she
said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, on Dec. 23, 1979, Bruins defenseman Mike
Milbury whacked John Kaptain, a Rangers fan from New Jersey, with a
shoe during a bizarre altercation in which all but one Bruins
player went over the glass and into the stands at Madison Square
Garden. The incident, after a 4-3 Bruins victory, resulted in three
players being suspended, lawsuits and the installation of higher
glass in the arena. It remains one of the most memorable
fan-athlete confrontations in sports.
</P>
<P>
It all unfolded after Phil Esposito of the Rangers smashed his
stick on the ice and skated off to the locker room after failing to
convert a breakaway in the waning seconds. When the buzzer sounded,
Al Secord, Boston's rugged left wing, decked the Rangers' Ulf
Nilsson.
</P>
<P>
"I remembered the sucker punch he gave me earlier in the game,
so I thought, an eye for an eye, and I suckered him," Secord
said.As a scrum of players exchanged words, Kaptain, who was 30 and
owned an executive recruitment firm, reportedly reached over the
low glass panel and hit Stan Jonathan, the Bruins' enforcer, with a
rolled-up program, drawing blood beneath Jonathan's eyes. He then
made off with Jonathan's stick.
</P>
<P>
"He just reached over the glass and whacked me with it,"
Jonathan said. "I put my stick up to protect myself, and he just
took it, and I can't be hitting no fan with a stick, really, eh, so
I just let him take it."
</P>
<P>
Bruins forward Terry O'Reilly, who engaged in a career-high 22
fights during the season, thought that Jonathan had been punched by
a fan. He was the first player to climb over the glass to confront
Kaptain, who, he said, was wielding Jonathan's stick as if he were
"cutting down a hayfield."
</P>
<P>
Kaptain, who has since died, admitted at the time that he had
struck a player, but said he did so because his brother had been
hit.
</P>
<P>
"I may have hit Jonathan when he was on the ice," Kaptain told
reporters. "I'm not saying I'm right in hitting him. I don't even
know if I hit the right player. But my brother got hit by one of
them first."
</P>
<P>
Peter McNab, who had only four penalty minutes the previous
season, shed his inhibitions and followed his linemate into the
stands.
</P>
<P>
"Peter was usually the guy who'd pick up our gloves for us
after a fight," Jonathan said.
</P>
<P>
Don Cherry, who had coached the Bruins the season before and
watched the game on television, said he was pleased to see McNab
acting out of character. "I was quite proud of him," he said.
</P>
<P>
Milbury and Boston's goalie, Gerry Cheevers, had reached the
locker room when the players went into the stands.
</P>
<P>
"I went from happy and content, and ready to go home for
Christmas, to full combat mode in about 20 seconds," Milbury said.
</P>
<P>
Cheevers, meanwhile, wanted no part of the action. "I was
already on my second beer," he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
O'Reilly insisted that he had entered the stands merely to
"detain" Kaptain.
</P>
<P>
"There was no way he was going to strike one of my teammates
and steal his stick, wield it like a weapon and then disappear into
the crowd and go to a local bar with a souvenir and a great
story," O'Reilly said. "As soon as I got him into a bearhug, I
felt like I was being pummeled by multiple people. All I could do
was cover up."
</P>
<P>
Cherry had a different recollection. "Never in my life did I
see Terry O'Reilly covering up during a fight," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kaptain managed to break free of O'Reilly but was corralled
several rows up by McNab and Milbury, who pinned him across a seat.
</P>
<P>
"I grabbed his shoe, took a little tug on it, and then sort of
double pumped," Milbury said. "I don't know if I hesitated for a
minute because I thought I'd be vilified for the next 30 years, but
I gave him a cuff across the leg, and then I did what I thought was
probably the most egregious thing of all: I threw his shoe on the
ice."
</P>
<P>
Eighteen Bruins went into the stands. Milbury said, "If you
watch the tape -- and I can freely throw my teammates under the bus
now after 30 years -- people were throwing some serious shots down
below us that were obscured by the fact that everybody was focusing
on the idiot highest up in the stands hitting somebody with a
shoe."
</P>
<P>
Security guards eventually separated the combatants. John
Kaptain, with his brother, James; his father, Manny; and a friend,
Jack Guttenplan, were charged with disorderly conduct. After the
game, a crowd of about 300 Rangers fans rocked the Bruins' bus and
had to be dispersed by eight mounted police officers.Robert
Seagriff, then the Garden's assistant director of security, said
there was trouble whenever the Bruins came to town. "There would
always be a big contingent of Boston cops that would come down for
the games," he said. "And there were always problems between the
cops and Rangers fans. When Boston came in, we'd beef up security
wherever the cops were sitting."
</P>
<P>
A month later, the NHL president, John Ziegler, suspended
O'Reilly for eight games and McNab and Milbury for six. They were
each fined $500 and the rest of the Bruins, except for Cheevers,
were fined up to $500.
</P>
<P>
An outraged Bruins organization tried unsuccessfully to overturn
the suspensions in court. Paul Mooney, the team president, said in
a statement, "We do not accept his findings, and we are very proud
of our players and the way they conducted themselves under very
difficult circumstances."
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 23 1980, the Kaptain family held a news conference at
the St. Moritz hotel to announce they were filing a lawsuit. "We
wanted the public to know we weren't animals," John Kaptain said
at the time.
</P>
<P>
The suit was ultimately abandoned. "There was no money, no
apology, nothing," said Irwin Levy, the Kaptains' lawyer.The
charges against the Kaptains and Guttenplan were eventually
dropped, and the Manhattan district attorney declined to press
criminal charges against the players. No one was seriously hurt in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
The altercation did nothing to damage the career prospects of
the players involved. Nine went on to NHL coaching careers, and
several worked as scouts or broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
Bruins fans, in particular, still relish the incident. E.M.
Swift, who covered hockey for Sports Illustrated, played in a
college game in 1972 when one of his Princeton teammates was beaten
with a "stale Italian sub" by the Colgate athletic director while
he grappled with Milbury. "We hate everything New York here in
Boston," he said, "so the fact that it was the Rangers and New
Yorkers getting beaten with a shoe, those guys are folk heroes up
here."
</P>
<P>
The actor Denis Leary may reflect the feelings of many Bruins
fans. In an e-mail message, he said that anyone who believed "that
two tickets and four plastic cups" of beer entitled you to
"antagonize men who beat the living headlights out of each other
for a living deserves to have his keister kicked."
</P>
<P>
He added, "That's what I call thinning the herd."The Rangers,
meanwhile, have the model Carol Alt in their corner. Alt has what
she referred to as "one foot in each cage" as a "huge Rangers
fan," the ex-wife of the former Ranger Ron Greschner and now the
companion of Alexei Yashin, a former Islander who plays for SKA in
Russia's Kontinental Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
It was important to keep the "herds in their respective
cages," Alt said in an e-mail message from St. Petersburg, Russia.
She said it was Milbury who should have been beaten with a shoe.
</P>
<P>
"Players with padding are like mammoths in the stands running
over unarmed, shoeless, domestic house pets," she said.
</P>
<P>
Milbury acknowledged that many people outside hockey did not
laugh at the incident. "None of us wanted to be in the toothless
Neanderthal grouping," he said. "In the greater public's view, it
re-emphasized stereotypes of hockey players."
</P>
<P>
Despite having to repeatedly defend their actions, the three
suspended Bruins say they were justified.
</P>
<P>
"Under the same circumstances, I don't think I'd go through a
process of sorting through the rules and regulations and legal
consequences," O'Reilly said. "I think I'd jump over the glass
and grab the guy again."
</P>
<P>
The Kaptain brothers have died, but their father, a World War II
infantryman who is now 84, still loves hockey, and their mother
still hates it. Manny Kaptain holds no grudge against the Bruins,
although he has not been back to a game since the night his son
John had to walk home with only one shoe.

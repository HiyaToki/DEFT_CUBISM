<P>
Botswana says on Friday that it has decided to recall its defense and
intelligence attatches from Zimbabwe after Zimbabwe detained three Botswana
wildlife officers two weeks ago and has refused to release them.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Office in Botswana says they will have recalled their
officers by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of the Republic of Botswana expects the Government of the
Republic of Zimbabwe to reciprocate by recalling its Defense and Central
Intelligence Organisation Attach√©s from Botswana by the same date. The position
of the Government of Botswana is that these two posts should be frozen and never
to be filled," said Botswana's Foreign Minister Phandu Skelemani in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Botswana expressed its frustration with its neighbor Zimbabwe for its refusal to
let go three wildlife officers, who allegedly trespassed into Zimbabwean with
weapons of war. The Botswana wildlife officers are now facing criminal charges
in Zimbabwean courts.
</P>
<P>
Skelemani said Botswana wishes to express its deep disappointment over the
detention of the three wildlife officers in Zimbabwe despite attempts at finding
an amicable diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
The statement says efforts by Botswana have included phone calls by the foreign
minister and Police Commissioner Thebeyame Tsimako to their counterparts in
Zimbabwe to resolve this issue.
</P>
<P>
"These phone calls remain unreturned, giving the impression that the Government
of Zimbabwe does not want to discuss this issue with Botswana," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"Additional efforts have included our Ambassador in Harare going to the Zimbabwe
Foreign Ministry several times to seek their intervention the matter as well as
the Ambassador of Zimbabwe to Botswana being summoned twice to the Foreign
Ministry to seek the Zimbabwe Government's intervention in finding an amicable
diplomatic solution to the problem," Skelemani added.
</P>
<P>
"As a last endeavor, His Honor the Vice President, Lieutenant General Mompati
Merafhe, attempted, through the Foreign Minister of Zimbabwe, to meet with
President Mugabe at the recently held African Union Meeting in Addis Ababa
Ethiopia but was unsuccessful, " the foreign minister said.

London	2010-02-21T14:00:00	-2	moregano	I hate the constant crowds and business in central London; in Edinburgh if I go into town at the right time of day or the right point in the year (ie not tourist season), the number of people is just about bearable.
London	2010-02-21T14:14:00	0	Aphotic Cosmos	Never been to New York, and I envy my Human Geography colleagues for being able to go there next year (although we get to go to Almeria in Spain <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":cool:"/> ), but I doubt it compares to the imperial majesty of central London.
London	2010-02-21T14:14:00	0	PimmsO'Clock	New York's crime rate is much lower than London's.
London	2010-02-21T14:35:00	-1	FormerlyHistoryStudent	EDIT: I think a lot of people are saying New York because of the novelty of it - London doesn't seem as interesting because they've lived in Britain all their lives - 'familiarity breed contempt', if you will.
London	2010-02-21T14:40:00	-2	TheLouisVuittonDon	I find London incredibly depressing now, maybe just because i'm used to it.
London	2010-02-21T14:49:00	-2	Lack of Creativity	I find London depressing.
London	2010-02-21T14:50:00	-1	Phyos	I am from NY and I miss it so much.
London	2010-02-21T14:51:00	-2	fliss_pop	i've never liked London, it just has the wrong feeling in the air for me.
London	2010-02-21T17:13:00	-2	SomeStudent	I don't like London, so I'll say New York <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/>
London	2010-02-21T18:41:00	-2	HotCoco.	I prefer London though as it can be quirky and random most times. <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/> I felt disappointed with my first visit to NY, totally overrated.
London	2010-02-21T19:38:00	0	ak56	In these areas it has been evident that they are the sort of places where crime definately does exist under the surface, but I never felt unsafe in any of them, there certainly was not the apmosphere of tension and risk that does exist in many rough parts of London, even during the day.
London	2010-02-21T19:38:00	-1	ak56	In my experience, in 2010 the roughest parts of New York are no worse than the roughest parts of London, and as in New York there is a more defined destinction between good areas and bad areas, you are safer in New York than you are in London.
London	2010-02-22T03:42:00	0	- skyhigh -	Places in London close down too early <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/moon.gif" alt=":moon:"/>
London	2010-02-22T03:51:00	-1	Laura182	London is in England so it's crap by default.
London	2010-02-22T10:06:00	0	ak56	Also, the rough areas of New York ultimately pose less risk to an uninvolved stranger than the rough areas of London to.
London	2010-02-22T10:33:00	0	WaltzvWendt	But I've also lived in quite diverse and busy areas of London, so idk what my problem is <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/confused.gif" alt=":confused:"/>
London	2010-02-22T15:08:00	-1	awm55	This is mostly due to the accesibility of housing (you can afford a small apartment in Manhatten on a graduate salary while in London this is very difficult).
London	2010-03-20T22:45:00	-2	happinessmachine	When I left for NYC from London I was so sure I hated London and couldn't wait to be out of there and was so sure I'd fall in love with NYC...boy was I wrong and the "you never know what you got til it's gone" saying never applied more.
London	2010-03-20T22:45:00	-1	happinessmachine	I've realized people in London are actually overly polite and it can be "fake", just to "say it" but not mean it.
London	2010-03-20T22:45:00	-1	happinessmachine	Londoners don't have enough individualism and tend to see everyone "the same", this is really dangerous when you're trying to be different or make something out of yourself, you feel very quickly discouraged.
London	2010-03-20T22:45:00	-2	happinessmachine	Is the norm being sad and depressed?People in London are just more depressed and seem so sad all the time.
London	2011-06-13T07:22:00	-1	FNKYCHLD	I know this is an old post, but not for nothing, there is no way the worst neighborhoods in London are as bad as the worst neighborhoods in New York.
London	2011-06-13T07:22:00	-2	FNKYCHLD	in 2010 there were 135 murders in London.

<TEXT>
<P>
Australian Scott Sunderland has left his post as senior sports director with
Team Sky after reaching a mutual agreement, the British cycling team announced
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland, a former professional who worked with the CSC then Saxo Bank teams
after retiring from the sport, was one of the first sports directors to join up
with Team Sky and helped sign many of their riders.
</P>
<P>
Reasons for Sunderland's departure were not revealed, although Sunderland is
believed to want to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
Dave Brailsford, the Team Principal for Team Sky, said: "We would like to thank
Scott for his contribution to Team Sky.
</P>
<P>
"He helped us get from the drawing board to being a real road team, working with
us from the announcement of the project to our first podium finishes. We all
wish Scott the very best, personally and for his future career."
</P>
<P>
Sunderland said: "It has been an incredible journey, helping to set up a new,
highly professional team from scratch.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the team's achievements so far and wish them the best of luck for
the rest of the season, their first Tour de France and a successful future."
</P>
<P>
Britain's Bradley Wiggins will spearhead Team Sky's bid for glory on the 2010
Tour de France, on which he finished fourth overall last year.

Israel bars Noam Chomsky from West Bank: Palestinians

Ramallah, West Bank, May 16, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Renowned Jewish-American scholar and political activist Noam Chomsky was barred
from entering Israel and the West Bank on Sunday, a Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
Chomsky had been invited to speak on Monday at the Palestinian Bir Zeit
University near Ramallah, but was stopped from entering the West Bank at the
Israeli-controlled crossing from Jordan, said Palestinian lawmaker Mustafa
Barghuti.
</P>
<P>
"He called us from the border to say he was stopped for five hours on the
Israeli side and then denied entry because of his opinions and because he was
against Israel's policies," Barghuti told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Israel's interior ministry, which control the country's borders,
were not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
"This act shows the nature of the Israeli government that is against freedom of
speech, particularly from such a noted international figure like Chomsky," said
Barghuti, who had invited Chomsky to speak at the university.
</P>
<P>
Chomsky, 81, is a professor of linguistics at the US Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and a prominent critic of US foreign policy. He has also frequently
spoken out against Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories.

Algeria, South Africa slam WSahara 'rights violations'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Algiers, May 26, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Algeria and South Africa condemned Wednesday alleged human rights violations in
the disputed Western Sahara and reiterated calls for a referendum on the
territory's possible independence from Morocco.
</P>
<P>
South African President Jacob Zuma was in Algiers for a two-day meeting of a bi-
national commission between the countries, and held talks with his Algerian
counterpart Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions touched on developments in the Western Sahara, where
separatist guerillas backed by Algiers want a referendum on self-determination,
with independence as one of the options.
</P>
<P>
An official statement issued on the APS agency after the meeting said the men
"had condemned the violation of human rights in the occupied territories".
</P>
<P>
They issued an "urgent appeal" to the United Nations to put in place a mechanism
to protect human rights in the region.
</P>
<P>
A UN Security Council resolution that last month extended the mandate of its
mission in the disputed Western Sahara made no mention of any monitoring of the
human rights allegations, as sought by some council members.
</P>
<P>
Zuma and Bouteflika said in the statement that the Western Sahara issue was a
"question of decolonisation" and should be based on "the right to self-
determination" of the people in the region via referendum.
</P>
<P>
Morocco has pledged to grant Western Sahara widespread autonomy but rules out
independence.
</P>
<P>
Its 1975 annexation of the Western Sahara sparked a war between its forces and
the Algerian-backed Polisario guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to a ceasefire in 1991 but UN-sponsored talks on Western
Sahara's future have since made no headway.
</P>
<P>
The South African and Algerian presidents were also present for the signing of a
set of agreements between their countries, including over the peaceful use of
nuclear energy, sport and cooperation on water resources.

Greece condemns Israel deadly raid
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
athens, May 31, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greece condemned Israel's use of deadly force on an aid flotilla bound for Gaza
Monday and withdrew from joint military exercises over the incident.
</P>
<P>
At least two ships in the six-vessel fleet were Greek and dozens of the
activists on them were from Greece, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot justify the use of violence of such force, we condemn it," said Greek
deputy foreign minister Dimitris Droutsas who summoned the Israeli ambassador to
Athens, Ali Yahya.
</P>
<P>
He said he told Yahya that Greece was halting the joint exercises with Israel
and cancelled a visit due to start Tuesday by the Israeli air force chief."
</P>
<P>
Greece demanded details on about 30 Greeks who were on the flotilla taking aid
to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip that was attacked by Israeli commandoes, the
foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Up to 19 activists were killed and some 36 others wounded in the raid, according
to Israeli media.
</P>
<P>
"Greece's consistent position is that the activities of any non-government
organisation must be freely allowed as long as they are legal," said a foreign
ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
Defence Minister Evangelos Venizelos ordered the Greek chiefs of staff to halt
the air force exercises with Israel, codenamed Minoas 2010, which started in
Crete last Tuesday. The war games were supposed to finish on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A Greek non-governental organisation, The Boat For Gaza group, said its vessel
the Sfendoni was attacked alongside the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara.
</P>
<P>
"There was an attack with live bullets against the Greek boat Sfendoni and the
Turkish boat Mavi Marmara, with helicopters and inflatable boats," the Greek
organisation said in a statement. Israel denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
It said the attack took place in international waters about 80 nautical miles
from the coast.
</P>
<P>
Boat For Gaza said it was told about the attack by activists on another Greek
vessel, the Eleftheri Mesogeio, which had tried to keep going toward Gaza, but
was also seized by the Israeli navy, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that before a satellite telephone line was cut with one of
the activists on board, Takis Politis, he was heard shouting, "they are coming
on board with grappling irons, we are under arrest."
</P>
<P>
The NGO added that two Greeks were on the Mavi Marmara and 12 others with a
Tunisian on Sfentoni, while 22 Greeks and eight Swedish nationals were on the
Eleftheri Mesogeio.
</P>
<P>
Greek far-left organisations called for demonstrations on Monday outside the
Israeli embassy.

US 'appalled' at Malawi convictions
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, May 20, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States said Thursday it was "appalled" by the jailing of a gay couple
in Malawi, calling it a step backward in the protection of human rights in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is appalled by today's sentencing of same-sex couple Tiwonge
Chimbalanga and Steven Monjeza to 14 years of hard labor," State Department
spokesman Philip Crowley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We view the criminalization of sexual orientation and gender identity as a step
backward in the protection of human rights in Malawi," he said, reading a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"We are particularly disturbed by the severity of the sentence. The government
of Malawi must respect the human rights of all of its citizens," Crowley added.
</P>
<P>
"The United States views the decriminalization of sexual orientation and gender
identity as integral to the protection of human rights in Malawi and elsewhere
in the world."
</P>
<P>
Chimbalanga and Monjeza were arrested on December 28 after holding an illegal
same-sex wedding, accused of violating "the order of nature". They were
convicted Tuesday and sentenced Thursday to 14 years hard labor in jail.
</P>
<P>
The men's lawyer, Mauya Msuku, said he would consult with his clients on filing
an appeal.
</P>
<P>
Homosexuality is illegal in Malawi and the couple was arrested under sodomy
laws.

Egypt Islamists condemn 'irregularities' ahead of vote
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
cairo, May 30, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest opposition group, on Sunday denounced
"corruption and irregularities" ahead of Tuesday's elections for parliament's
upper house.
</P>
<P>
"When we decided to field candidates in this election, we thought the regime
would keep some of its promises and was sincere," the group's supreme guide
Mohammed Badie told reporters, in reference to government vows of holding free
and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it has disappointed the people and has returned to its original
path of violating the constitution and the law, and the rights of candidates and
voters," he said.
</P>
<P>
Badie condemned the "corruption and irregularities," in the run-up to the
election, saying security officials had "removed posters of our candidates and
chased them and their supporters to prevent them from campaigning and meeting
their constituents."
</P>
<P>
"It has reached the stage of besieging the homes of the candidates," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood, which is officially banned, will be fielding around a
dozen candidates as independents in the mid-term election for the Shura Council,
the upper house of Egypt's bicameral legislature which is dominated by President
Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The Shura, a primarily advisory body, is made up of 264 members of whom 176 are
directly elected and 88 are appointed by the president. Membership is on a
rotating basis, with one third of the council renewed every three years.
</P>
<P>
The vote is unlikely to reshape the political landscape, with analysts expecting
a low voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
Some 446 candidates are to run for 74 seats in 55 electoral constituencies,
Intissar Nesmi, head of the High Elections Commission told reporters. Fourteen
seats are not being contested.

Daybreak reveals death and destruction in Bangkok
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BANGKOK, May 20, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pall of acrid smoke shrouded Bangkok Thursday as dawn revealed smouldering
buildings, looted shops, and six dead bodies laid outside a temple where
thousands of people spent a night in terror.
</P>
<P>
An uneasy calm returned to the capital as people ventured back onto the streets
after a night-time curfew imposed by the army to allow them to quash remaining
pockets of resistance after it broke up an anti-government rally.
</P>
<P>
The charred ruins of the vast Central World shopping mall -- a favourite
destination of well-heeled Thais and foreign tourists -- was in ruins after
enraged protesters went on a rampage of arson and looting.
</P>
<P>
Firemen sprayed water into the remains of what was once one of the biggest
shopping centres in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The ground floor of the stock exchange was gutted after being set ablaze along
with dozens of other locations including banks and a television station.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers tore down red flags next to the remains of the protesters' barricades,
which had been roughly constructed with truck tyres, bamboo stakes and razor
wire.
</P>
<P>
At a temple inside the protest area, the bodies of six people killed during a
night of mayhem were laid out in the shade under a portrait of Thailand's
revered king, their feet poking out from mats placed over them.
</P>
<P>
The covers were briefly removed to reveal blood-streaked faces and bodies
riddled with bullet wounds.
</P>
<P>
People clutching belongings and children filed out of the pagoda, where an AFP
reporter had seen panic and tears the previous evening as gunfire and blasts
were heard outside and black-clad protesters darted in and out.
</P>
<P>
Police said nine people were killed at the temple, which had been seen as a
"safe zone" within the rally site before troops firing live rounds and backed by
armoured vehicles stormed the rally site on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The army denied any involvement in the deaths, blaming armed militants.
</P>
<P>
The government had laid on buses to take the Red Shirt protesters home after
their leaders surrendered, but the chaos in the streets, where buildings were
burning and armed men were roaming, meant many were unable to reach the area.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand is barbaric. It's a barbaric country. They used the soldiers to kill
us. That's not right," said Sirikwan Nemisiwpa, a woman in her late 50s who was
among those who spent the night in the temple.
</P>
<P>
"We are Red Shirts. We love peace, justice and democracy. The only thing we need
is the government to dissolve the parliament. That's it," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the nearby stage where Red Shirts leaders had for six weeks delivered fiery
speeches to rally their supporters, the area was deserted and a large banner
saying "peaceful protesters, no terrorists" was partly torn down.
</P>
<P>
Thai authorities warned that "armed militants" were still holed up in high rise
buildings nearby but the area was largely calm, with police and soldiers manning
checkpoints and patrolling.
</P>
<P>
Some protesters, many of whom hail from the impoverished north of Thailand, said
they did not want to end their campaign to oust a government they see as elitist
and undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
"I want to go back inside," a woman from northern Chiang Mai said with a smile
as she boarded a bus. "Without the police, I would have stayed in the temple
with Buddha."

Tourist-dependent Jamaica suffers image blow
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kingston, May 27, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Decaying corpses, masked gunmen and a fugitive drug don -- Jamaica's violence is
a blow to its image, although the tourism industry, true to the island's nature,
is taking a laid-back view.
</P>
<P>
From the top of the government on down, scarcely a public statement on Jamaica's
crisis goes by without stressing that the bloodshed in the capital Kingston is
far away from resorts, a major earner of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bruce Golding, addressing parliament after declaring a state of
emergency, acknowledged his move "has negative implications in terms of
international media coverage and its effect on tourism marketing."
</P>
<P>
"It is, however, a necessary measure to address our present challenge and every
effort is being made to minimize those negative effects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Golding ordered the assault to capture local don Christopher "Dudus" Coke, who
is wanted in the United States on drug trafficking charges and has turned
Kingston's slums into a virtual fiefdom.
</P>
<P>
But for many tourists, Kingston -- which has long had the dubious distinction of
being one of the world's murder capitals -- is simply an airport stop, if even
that.
</P>
<P>
Flights were intermittently disrupted to the city in the days after the violence
broke out on Sunday, although Montego Bay operated normally.
</P>
<P>
Since developing tourism after independence from Britain in 1962, Jamaica has
focused development on its sandy beaches in the north. Many sunbathers fly to
Montego Bay -- a four-hour drive from Kingston -- and head directly to the
beach.
</P>
<P>
John Lynch, the director of the Jamaica Tourism Board, said the industry was
weathering the crisis well.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we are getting less cancelations than we anticipated," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"We told the people that this is action in Kingston, which is our least popular
tourist destination."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed fears of a long-term image blow, saying proudly that Jamaica had
the most return visitors of any Caribbean island as tourists are enticed by its
unique history, spicy cuisine and rich music scene.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a crystal ball," Lynch said with a smile. "But Jamaicans are
natural salespeople."
</P>
<P>
Still, any slip in tourism could be a hard blow to an island that earlier this
year needed a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has been one bright spot in the economy. After a slowdown during the
financial crisis, Jamaica welcomed more than 200,000 tourists in March for the
first time over a one-month period, according to the Tourism Board.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.8 million tourists last year visited Jamaica, which itself is home
to only 2.8 million people, according to the board's figures. Some two-thirds of
the tourists are from the United States, followed by Canadians and Europeans.
</P>
<P>
By the estimate of the Global Travel and Tourism Partnership, which promotes
jobs in the industry, tourism directly or indirectly provides more than a
quarter of jobs in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
A hotel worker in Kingston, who did not want her name used so as not to
associate her views with her employer, feared the violence would hurt the image
of Jamaica as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"When you see on television overseas the burning and the shootings, what can you
think?" she said. "It's a shame for Jamaica."

UN agency assisting Palestinian refugees observes 60th
anniversary
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 24 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National leaders and senior government ministers from around the world gathered
at United Nations Headquarters in New York Thursday to pay tribute to the
efforts of a UN agency that has assisted Palestinian refugees across the Middle
East for 60 years.
</P>
<P>
A series of public events are being held to mark the 60th anniversary of the UN
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which
was set up to provide humanitarian assistance in the wake of the 1948 Arab-
Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
Karen AbuZayd, UNRWA's Commissioner-General, said the high- level event offers
"an occasion for reflection on why after 60 years of exile and dispossession,
millions of Palestine refugees remain stateless."
</P>
<P>
"With increasing talk about an emerging peace deal, let us all recommit
ourselves to finding a peaceful solution in which the tragic situation of the
refugees will be resolved," she said.
</P>
<P>
The agency currently provides education, health care, social services,
microfinance, camp improvement and other forms of emergency aid to an estimated
4.6 million refugees living in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the agency is "a
lifeline and a beacon of hope," as well as a powerful expression of the
international community's abiding concern about the Palestinian people and the
question of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging UNRWA's severe funding shortages, Ban appealed to all partners to
do their part to ensure that the agency's invaluable work is placed, once and
for all, on a firm financial foundation.
</P>
<P>
"The agency's work is too important for it to suffer budget crisis after budget
crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last week AbuZayd warned that UNRWA may not be able to pay the salaries of its
29,000 staff through the end of this year because of a funding crisis. She urged
UN Member States to donate more generously than ever to the agency.
</P>
<P>
Most of UNRWA's running costs go to staff salaries, the commissioner-general
said, and without an injection of nearly 17 million U.S. dollars each month the
agency will not be able to guarantee salaries into 2010.
</P>
<P>
AbuZayd said she has written in the past week to every country that has ever
donated to UNRWA to ask them to contribute "special pledges" given the current
situation, and she hopes they will respond urgently.
</P>
<P>
In a newly released commemorative book, many world figures have paid tribute to
the efforts of UNRWA, including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Jordan's
Queen Rania al Abdullah and United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Besides the high-level meeting, the observance also includes a panel debate and
the screening of a documentary film.

Interview: Mayor views G20 summit as chance to showcase diverse
economy, grow business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Xinhua writer Wang Wei
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 (Xinhua) -- When world leaders gather in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, next week for the G20 economic summit, Mayor Luke Ravenstahl hopes
to impress them with a diverse economy and a clean environment and also to grow
business for his reinvented city.
</P>
<P>
Hosting the G20 summit is "a good experience for Pittsburgh" and world leaders
can realize how wonderful this city is, Ravenstahl said during an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh, the second largest city in Pennsylvania, was put under the spotlight
in May after President Barack Obama announced that the city would host the third
G20 economic summit, which was initiated in November 2008 amid the global
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he picked Pittsburgh, Obama praised the city as "a bold example
of how to create new jobs and industries while transitioning to a 21st century
economy."
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh, also known as the "Steel City," was predominantly a steel town in
the 1970s, but the slump of the U.S. steel industry in 1980s, which resulted in
250,000 steel-related job cuts, left the city with no choice but to reinvent
itself.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the city features a diverse economy with not only steel but also
health care, higher education, financial services, life sciences and new energy,
said the mayor.
</P>
<P>
"What we have done and what a lot of people don't realize but hopefully will
realize after G20 is that we are not that old town and smoky town any more, but
in fact a town that is very diverse and welcoming to a lot of industries and
sectors," he said. "Because of that, I think President Obama chose us."
</P>
<P>
Due to its broader economic bases, Pittsburgh's economy has done better than
those of many other U.S. cities during the economic meltdown last year, with its
unemployment rate being 2 percentage points lower than the national average and
the housing market remaining stable.
</P>
<P>
"President Obama looks at Pittsburgh as a town that others can look to as a
model for what they should be doing in order to survive the economic downturn,"
said the mayor. "It is our hope when world leaders meet in Pittsburgh, they
agree on policies how we can turn this economy around."
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh, which ranks among the most livable and cleanest cities in the United
States, was considered fitting in another favorite theme of the president:
environment.
</P>
<P>
A White House statement released in May said the city was chosen because of its
"commitment to employing new and green technology to further economic recovery
and development."
</P>
<P>
For instance, the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, the main venue for the
upcoming G20 summit, received an endorsement from the U.S. Green Building
Council as an environmentally friendly design, which relies on skylights for
much of its lighting, uses recycled hand towels and takes water from fountains
for use in toilets, according to a Wall Street report.
</P>
<P>
The city is also known colloquially as the "city of bridges" for boasting 446
bridges.
</P>
<P>
"In a place known as the city of bridges, we can come together to advance our
common interest in a global recovery, while turning the page to a truly 21st
century economy," Obama said of the feature in a statement earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
High livability, quality education, convenient transportation and a stable job
market build the city's status as a corporate headquarters' home, with over 300
companies based here, including eight listed on the Fortune 500.
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can use this opportunity to grow business," Ravenstahl said of one
of his goals in hosting the G20 summit.
</P>
<P>
He singled out China as having great potential for cooperation that Pittsburgh
is looking for.
</P>
<P>
Before Pittsburgh was chosen to host the G20 meeting, Ravenstahl had been well
known nationwide as the youngest mayor of a major city.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, then Pittsburgh mayor Bob O'Connor died, pushing Ravenstahl, a 26-year-
old city council president, to the top administrative post. He won reelection.
</P>
<P>
"I am only 29 years old and I am the mayor of the city. It shows you that
anything is possible in Pittsburgh, especially for young professionals," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, expectations have come along with challenges to the young mayor.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference last week that the city was in the process of
training police officers, 1,000 from the city and another 1,000 from the state,
to deal with additional security posed by the conference, which was expected to
cost almost 34 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he felt pressure in hosting the event, Ravenstahl said: "It is not
just me, but a great team in Pittsburgh and a region working together."
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to collectively hosting the world, and it is an honor to be
part of it," he added.

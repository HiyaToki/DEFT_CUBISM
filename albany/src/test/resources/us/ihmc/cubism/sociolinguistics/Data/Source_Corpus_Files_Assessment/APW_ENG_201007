NATO: military ties with Russia improving steadily

<P>
NATO's relations with Russia are improving thanks to shared security concerns involving Afghanistan, terrorism and maritime piracy, the alliance's top officer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a weekend visit to Moscow, Italian Adm. Giampaolo Di Paola said the boost in military relations follows months of political meetings by foreign ministers and other officials after NATO-Russia ties were suspended in 2008 in the wake of the Russian-Georgian war.
</P>
<P>
"Military-to-military cooperation is certainly better than before, and is definitely improving," said Di Paola, who heads the alliance's military committee. While in Moscow on Saturday, Di Paola met with Russian defense chief Gen. Nikolai Makarov.
</P>
<P>
NATO's relations with Russia rebounded after President Barack Obama announced his hope of resetting U.S. ties with Russia. In April, Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a new nuclear arms reduction treaty.
</P>
<P>
Last month, NATO began supplying troops in Afghanistan by a route through Russia and Central Asia, allowing the alliance to bypass ambush-prone routes through Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The development signaled Russia's willingness to indirectly support the NATO-led mission, possibly fearing a NATO defeat in Afghanistan could destabilize neighboring Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Relations on the political side are improving since the "resetting," and the military has sped up their attempts to build up trust and confidence," Di Paola told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have "identified and talked about" areas of potential cooperation included Afghanistan, counter-terrorism and naval anti-piracy operations off Somalia, Di Paola said, and NATO is studying a Russian proposal for supplying transport and helicopter gunships to the nascent Afghan air force.
</P>
<P>
NATO is seeking about 20 Russian-built Mil Mi-17 transport and Mi-24 gunship helicopters for the Afghan National Army Air Corps, alliance officials have said.
</P>
<P>
Afghan pilots and mechanics are accustomed to the robust and easy-to-maintain choppers, which they have used since the early 1980s.

UK ' s Cameron: releasing Lockerbie bomber was wrong
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON 2010-07-19 16:39:36 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain's prime minister criticized the Scottish government's decision to free Lockerbie bomber Abdel Baset al-Megrahi from jail last year, saying Monday that the move had been "completely and utterly wrong."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister David Cameron told the BBC he had opposed the decision to return the cancer-stricken prisoner to Libya on compassionate grounds in August.
</P>
<P>
He spoke before leaving Tuesday for his first visit as British leader to the United States, where he is expected to face questioning about the case. Cameron took office in May, after an inconclusive election that resulted in his Conservative Party forming a coalition government that ousted the previous Labour Party administration.
</P>
<P>
"As leader of opposition, I couldn't have been more clear that I thought the decision to release al-Megrahi was completely and utterly wrong," Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
The decision had been made by the Scotland's government, which holds some limited powers within the United Kingdom, and not by the previous British government headed by Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
</P>
<P>
Al-Megrahi served eight years of a life sentence for the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board, most of them Americans, and 11 people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of victims killed in the crash said Cameron's words must be backed by actions to have any real meaning.
</P>
<P>
"That's a wonderful statement, what are you going to do to back that up with substance," asked Bert Ammerman of River Vale, New Jersey, who lost his brother Tom in the crash. He called for investigations in the UK and U.S. into the circumstances of the release.
</P>
<P>
"There has to be an investigation done on how this took place, and heads have to roll," he said.
</P>
<P>
Scotland's government has previously held an inquiry into the case, while Brown's administration released internal documents related to the case.
</P>
<P>
Glenn Johnson of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, whose daughter Beth Ann died in the crash, said Cameron's words offered little comfort. "For the prime minister to come forward and say it was a mistake, that's just politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two New York senators, who have called for an inquiry into oil giant BP's lobbying of the British government over a prisoner transfer agreement with Libya, reacted positively to the comments. They suspect the lobbying may have bearing on the case.
</P>
<P>
"This admission is a first step in getting to the bottom of what could well be a quid pro quo for an oil contract," Sen. Charles Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Kirsten Gillbrand said she respected the comments, but "we need further review of how and why al-Megrahi was released, so we can learn from this mistake and assess what steps can be taken so that justice is served and terrorists are held accountable."
</P>
<P>
Cameron's Downing Street office said a British-government commissioned inquiry was "not currently under consideration."
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea what BP did, I am not responsible for BP," Cameron said. But he insisted that discussions between BP and Brown's administration on a prisoner transfer agreement did not include talks on al-Megrahi.
</P>
<P>
Al-Megrahi served eight years of a life sentence for the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board, most of them Americans, and 11 people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
BP has acknowledged it had urged the British government to sign a prisoner transfer agreement with Libya, but stressed it didn't specifically discuss al-Megrahi's case during those talks.
</P>
<P>
Britain's growing diplomatic and business ties with Libya had been under intense scrutiny since al-Megrahi's release. Critics have accused British authorities of putting commercial interests before the families of the 270 victims of the attack.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the U.K. have insisted the prisoner transfer deal was part of broader diplomatic effort aimed at furthering efforts to transform Libya from a rogue state to Western ally. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi renounced terrorism and dismantled his country's clandestine nuclear program in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Schumer and three other U.S. senators asked the State Department last week to investigate whether BP pressured lawmakers as part of efforts to seek access to Libyan oil fields.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent Saturday to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. John Kerry, Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague said there was nothing to suggest BP had influenced the Scottish government.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that corroborates in any way the allegations of BP involvement in the Scottish executive's decision to release al-Megrahi on compassionate grounds in 2009, nor any suggestion that the Scottish executive decided to release al-Megrahi in order to facilitate oil deals for BP," Hague wrote.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Cameron will hold talks with President Barack Obama, as well as meetings with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senior legislators. Separately, he will meet with Sen. John McCain.

<P>
A news report says North Korea's football team and coach have been reprimanded by the government for the team's performance at the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Radio Free Asia said the team was summoned to a closed-door meeting in Pyongyang earlier this month and criticized for the losses to Brazil, Portugal and Ivory Coast. The report says players were then ordered to reprimand coach Kim Jong Hun.
</P>
<P>
The report cited unidentified sources in North Korea and a Chinese businessman described as knowledgeable about North Korea affairs. South Korea's main spy agency could not confirm the report, and there was no mention of any such meeting in North Korean state media.

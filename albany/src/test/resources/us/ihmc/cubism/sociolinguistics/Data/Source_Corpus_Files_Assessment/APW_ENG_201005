Didier Deschamps is the prodigal son Marseille has been waiting to welcome home.
</P>
<P>
Deschamps was a key player on the last Marseille team to win the French league title, in 1992. So it could not have been more fitting for Deschamps to come back as coach in his first season and guide Marseille to its ninth title, only one behind Saint-Etienne's record.
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean city, whose supporters are known for their passion for football, had been waiting for some silverware since winning the Champions League in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Deschamps not only claimed the league championship, but also led Marseille to the League Cup title by beating Bordeaux in March.

France honors director Haneke in Cannes ceremony

<TEXT>
<P>
Award-winning Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke has yet another feather in his cap. "The White Ribbon" director has been added to France's cultural honor roll in a ceremony at the Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
Culture Minister Frederic Mitterrand pinned a green and gold medallion on the filmmaker, making him a Commander in France's National Order of Arts and Letters. French actress Juliette Binoche, the star of Haneke's "Hidden" and "Code Unknown," was on hand for Sunday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand praised Haneke for his unflinching examination of violence -- a constant theme in his movies, including the Oscar-nominated "White Ribbon." Set in pre-World War I Germany, the film won Cannes' top prize last year.
</P>
<P>
Haneke said Sunday's distinction showed that France loves him as much as he loves France.

PNA welcomes bigger role by EU in peace talks

<TEXT>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on Saturday said it welcomes a bigger
role by the European Union (EU) into Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The PNA supports an EU representation in sponsoring the peace process and
welcomes more European engagement in it," Ghassan Al- Shak'a, a senior official
from Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO), told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shak'a's remarks were in response to French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner
who demanded that the EU be represented in the negotiations between the Israelis
and the Palestinians when they start next month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Kouchner said it would be "a shame" if the EU was away from discussions since
most of the aid the PNA receives has been coming from the EU.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shak'a said "the Palestinians are looking to adopt the statement of the
Quartet, which the EU is a main party in it, as a basic reference for the
negotiations,"
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 20, the Quartet, which also comprises the United States, Russia and the
United Nations, issued a statement supporting Washington's invitation to Israel
and the Palestinians to resume their talks on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations have stopped in December 2008 when Israel launched a military
operation in Gaza and the continuation of Jewish settlement in the occupied West
Bank and East Jerusalem blocked all efforts to resume the talks. But in May, the
United States brokered indirect proximity discussions to bridge the gaps between
Israel and the Palestinians.

3rd LD Writethru: Elena Kagan confirmed as U.S. Supreme Court
justice
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Elena Kagan as Supreme Court justice, making
her the fourth woman to sit in the high court.
</P>
<P>
President Barack Obama, who nominated Kagan, said he was "pleased" with the
confirmation, and was confident Kagan would do well in her new job.
</P>
<P>
Kagan, Obama's second Supreme Court nominee, was approved on a 63-37 vote. She
currently serves as Solicitor General for the administration and will replace
retiring justice John Paul Stevens in the high court's fall session.
</P>
<P>
Kagan will have to take oath of office before becoming a Supreme Court justice.
Her confirmation was seen as a done deal from the beginning, as the confirmation
needs only a simple majority in the Democratic-led Senate.
</P>
<P>
The voting went down largely along party line. All but one Democratic Senators,
two independents and five Republicans voted for her, while all other Republicans
voted "no."
</P>
<P>
As Solicitor General, Kagan argued for the U.S. government before the high
court. She also worked as dean of the prestigious Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
Republicans assailed her for lack of experience as a judge, and questioned her
impartiality.
</P>
<P>
Kagan defended her impartiality as well as her modesty, saying "I will do my
best to consider every case impartially, modestly, with commitment to principle,
and in accordance with law."
</P>
<P>
Prior to Kagan, Obama nominated appeals court judge Sonia Sotomayor to the
Supreme Court, and she was confirmed last year on a 68-31 vote, becoming the
first Hispanic sits on the high court's bench.
</P>
<P>
With Kagan nomination approved, the Supreme Court will have three female
justices when it returns to business in October. The other two are Sotomayor and
Ruth Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
Obama, who was in Chicago on Thursday, issued a statement shortly after the
vote, saying the Senate Judiciary Committee has thoroughly scrutinized Elena's
record, and "after 17 hours of testimony during which she answered more than 540
questions, I'd say they got a pretty good look at Elena Kagan."
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that Elena Kagan will make an outstanding Supreme Court
Justice," Obama said, noting the vote was a bipartisan one.

Iran to target enemies' interests around the world, if attacked:
IRGC

TEHRAN, Aug. 19 (Xinhua)

<TEXT>
<P>
Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) announced on Thursday that in case
the country is attacked, the IRGC will target the interests of the enemies in
any part of the world.
</P>
<P>
IRGC has gained capabilities and strength enough to target the interests of the
enemies in face of attacks, said the announcement posted on IRGC's website.
</P>
<P>
"IRGC is in full readiness to encounter firmly with the stupidity of the U.S.
and the Zionist regime (of Israel)," Public Relations of IRGC was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen
said the United States has a plan in place to attack Iran, if it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
"Military actions have been on the table and remain on the table" for curbing
Iran's nuclear ambition, Mullen, the highest ranking U.S. military officer, told
NBC's "Meet the Press".
</P>
<P>
"In a decisive battle, IRGC will impose a definite defeat to the enemies," said
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Muslim Iranians have proved that, despite the economic pressures, military
threats and psychological war, they will push forward with their inalienable
objectives, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Wednesday that if the
military threats of the enemies come true, Iranians will extend the battlefield
to beyond the region.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Iran's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Eshaq Alehabib,
complained to UN about U.S. military threats against the country over its
nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the UN Security Council (UNSC), Alehabib criticized the
U.S. for the military threats.

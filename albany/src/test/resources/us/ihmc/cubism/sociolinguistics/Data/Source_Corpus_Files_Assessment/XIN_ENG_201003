<TEXT>
<P>
Malaysia has urged the Swedish government to take measures against three Swedish
newspapers for reprinting the caricature of Prophet Muhammad last week.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian foreign minister Anifah Aman said in a statement issued here on
Saturday that Malaysia strongly denounced the reprinting of the caricature on
March 10, local newspaper, The Star reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Anifah said Malaysia was concerned that such despicable acts disregarded the
sensitivities of the Muslim world in the name of freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
He described these acts as "irresponsible" and "provocative and offensive in
nature" which were totally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he urged the Swedish authorities to take certain actions to prevent
the repeat of such irresponsible acts in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to The Star, the caricature, depicting Prophet Muhammad's head on a
dog's body, is a creation of Swedish artist Lars Vilks, 63, and was submitted to
be displayed as an exhibit at a Swedish cultural heritage center. But it was
rejected on security reasons.

A Swedish newspaper printed the drawing in 2007, with an editorial defending
freedom of expression, leading to protests by Muslim countries and death threats
against Vilks, said the daily.

Hundreds of Malaysian Muslims held a protest here on Friday afternoon to protest
against three Swedish newspapers reprinting caricature of Prophet Muhammad in
early March.
</P>
<P>
The protest, organized by the Central Youth Council of Malaysian Islamic Party
(PAS), started at around 2 p.m. in front of the Swedish Embassy in the downtown
of Kuala Lumpur and attracted some three hundred participants.
</P>
<P>
Participants were holding slogans saying  "We fight for our Prophet" and "Don't
insult our Prophet Muhammad" and shouted aloud to express their anger and
dissatisfaction. They also ignited a Swedish national flag at the end of the
protest.
</P>
<P>
The caricature, drawn by Swedish artist Vilks, was firstly printed by a Swedish
newspaper in 2007 with an editorial defending freedom of expression. It was
reprinted on March 10.
</P>

In a memorandum submitted to the Swedish Embassy Friday afternoon, the
protesters demanded the Swedish government to take stern action against the
three newspapers, saying such provocative and offensive acts ignoring the
sensitivity of Muslim.

irresponsible act shows low integrity of the artists and the publications, and
will ultimately attract rage and dissatisfaction from Muslims.

Malaysia strongly denounced the reprinting of the caricature and urged the
Swedish authorities to take certain actions to prevent the repeat of such
irresponsible acts in the future.

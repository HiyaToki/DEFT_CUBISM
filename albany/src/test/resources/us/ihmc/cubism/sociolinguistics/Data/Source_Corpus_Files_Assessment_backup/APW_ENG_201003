An American professor at the University of Texas, Austin, has won the 6 million kroner ($1 million) Abel Prize for mathematics.
</P>
<P>
The prize jury praises John Tate as "a prime architect" of number theory, a branch of mathematics that has played a key role in the development of modern computers.
</P>
<P>
The award citation issued Wednesday says Tate "has truly left a conspicuous imprint on modern mathematics" by advancing "one of (its) most elaborate and sophisticated branches."
</P>
<P>
The annual Abel Prize was created by the Norwegian government in 2003 and is awarded to candidates who have contributed to the mathematical sciences. The winner is selected by an international committee of five mathematicians.
</P>
<P>
The prize will be given to Tate at a May 25 ceremony in Oslo.

Saudi Arabia: arrogant Israel challenges the world

<P>
Saudi Arabia has condemned Israel's "arrogant" policies in Jerusalem which it says are denying the rights of Arabs and Muslims in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
A government statement Wednesday criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for saying in Washington his government would not stop construction in Jerusalem, calling it the capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel recently announced new housing plans for east Jerusalem, which Palestinians want for a future capital.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Netanyahu's comments denied the rights of Palestinians and Muslims in Jerusalem and ignored international efforts to relaunch peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom asked the Quartet, consisting of U.S., Russia, U.N. and the EU, to explain Israel's "arrogant" policies which insist on challenging the world.

US coal town above mine fire claims massive fraud
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ALLENTOWN, Pennsylvania 2010-03-11 00:06:03 UTC

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of a coal mining town in the state of Pennsylvania have long believed the government's demolition of it was part of a plot to swipe the mineral rights to anthracite coal worth hundreds of millions of dollars -- and not, as officials said, the solution to an out-of-control underground mine fire that menaced the town with toxic gases.
</P>
<P>
Centralia was all but wiped off the map as the slow-burning mine fire that began in 1962 at the town dump spread to the network of mines beneath the town, threatening residents with poisonous gases and dangerous sinkholes. A $42 million government relocation program was largely completed by 1993, when officials forced dozens of holdouts to leave.
</P>
<P>
Now, in a last-ditch effort to save their homes from the wrecking ball, the few holdouts who remain in the Pennsylvania town are taking their claims of a conspiracy to court.
</P>
<P>
In a filing late Monday, four property owners and the borough of Centralia said a "massive fraud" forced the needless relocation of more than 1,000 residents and the destruction of more than 500 homes. The property owners asked a state appeals court to stop Pennsylvania officials from kicking them out and finishing off the town 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants a penny. They just want to be left alone," said Tom Hynoski, a Centralia native whose mother and sister are among the petitioners.
</P>
<P>
The state condemned the homes in the early 1990s but only recently moved to oust those who remain. The state's attorney on Tuesday dismissed the residents' claims as "conspiracy theories" and predicted they would be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
The property owners said in court documents they have evidence that the fire is "almost out" and no longer endangers their homes, if it ever did. Data kept by the Department of Environmental Protection show that underground temperatures have gone down by "several hundred percent" since measurements began. Further, a 2008 DEP study found that emissions of toxic gases are not a problem, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
"There is no mine fire or other related condition that justifies the taking of their property," the petition said.
</P>
<P>
State environmental officials, though, insist the fire remains a threat to the residents' health. The blaze has likely followed the coal seam deeper underground -- reducing temperatures in certain monitoring bore holes -- but gases from the fire can still accumulate in houses atop the fire, they say.
</P>
<P>
Property owners also claim in court documents that their town was ruined "in the face of evidence that suggests that a massive fraud may have been perpetrated" by parties "motivated primarily by interests in what is conservatively estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars of some of the best anthracite coal in the world."
</P>
<P>
Their attorney, Andrew Ostrowski, said Tuesday that the town owns the mineral rights. Once Centralia ceases to exist, the rights go to the state, which could sell them to a coal company to operate "one of the most productive strip mine operations in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Steve Fishman, in-house counsel for the state Department of Community and Economic Development, the agency forcing the residents out, disputed that Centralia owns the coal underneath the town, saying that it's not clear who possesses the mineral rights but that he knows of no legal document giving the town an ownership stake.
</P>
<P>
He predicted Commonwealth Court would dismiss the residents' petition, noting it raises claims nearly 20 years after the fact.
</P>
<P>
As far as the fire, he said, "I don't think there's anyone who seriously believes that the fire is out, and that it does not pose a threat."
</P>
<P>
Another attorney for the residents, Don Bailey, a former congressman and state auditor general, is working on a separate federal civil rights lawsuit in hopes of recovering "seed money" to rebuild the town, Ostrowski said.

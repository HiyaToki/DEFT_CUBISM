Living Standards in Western Europe
</headline>
<post author="ChrissyBoy" datetime="2006-07-22T01:12:00" id="p1">
I was wondering which of the big three Western European nations, Germany, Britain and France you guys believe to have the highest standard of living and quality of life. I've often wondered this and would like to know your opinions.

I would be inclined to go with France as although the UK beats it by one place in the 2005 UN Human Development Index (combining life expectancy,GDP per capita and literacy) I believe it has a better healthcare, higher life expectancy and also has less crime and is generally a less violent society. In saying that German cities are frequently ranked amongst the best in the world when it comes to rating the most liveable cities.

I realise it is difficult to come to a conclusive opinion on this but what do you think?

Also how do you reckon your chosen nation compares to the US?

Living standard is relatively easy compared to the highly subjective "quality of life" unit.

For living standard I would take a median income in the query populations. This would be fairly easy considering all three nations is easily translated into the Euro currency. Sum up their median purchasing power on goods and services, ability to buy health services, education, compare life expectancy, employment/unemployment etc. Keywords: house ownership/homelessness, cars, tv etc. I doubt you'll find big fluctuations between these countries.

Quality of life is a very difficult unit. How do you measure happiness? According to WHO Norway is the best country in the world to live in, but Norwegians are not the happiest people in the world. IIRC an African country was rated higher than Norway in an official happiness meter. I can only agree to that as I firmly believe that wealth doesn't translate into happiness although it's an important unit.

The term quality of life is almost as old as political science. Platon is considered the earliest "known" founder of political science and the term quality of life was first discussed by his "successor" Aristotle. What I'm trying to say is it's a very subjective and difficult question compared to living standard.

Will be interesting to follow your reasoning in this topic.

Definitely France, as long as you are not a car enthusiast.

What can possibly beat France? Six weeks of paid holidays a year, not including time off for strikes.

Cradle to grave health care, whether you work or not.

Mild weather. A warm air of 30C/86F is considered a "heatwave." Come here and check out Nevada's summer. They'll pay to have 86F temperature in their homes.

Top vacationing spot, especially for German troops. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

No immigration problems, unlike the US. Go to Paris and all you'll find are law abiding white Frenchmen going about their business.

lol, white frenchmen are the only ones law abiding???

errmm... and I guess some countries suite some people... for me, I would probably never leave India to live in another country but thats just myself.... and as for the highest standard of livings... I believe the Scandinivian countries are pretty high ranked in that area...

I think Britian has the highest per capita GDP and while Germany has quite sharp income differentials due to East Germany.

The proxy for happiness can be judged by two variables, namely purchasing power per capita and income inequality. Even for those republicans who hate income redistribution, some degree of income redistribution can increase happiness. Do any of you wonder how if Bill Gates would miss a hundred million (from his 60, 000 million) as much as youd love getting his hundred million?? Taking sum from the very rich and giving to the very poorest can boost overall happiness (by reducing happiness of the rich less than it increases happiness of the poor).

The problem is that life expectancy can give very skewed results because nations can overinvest in health. (Cuba)

Having said all the above, nothing beats level of economic growth. Nations with high levels of growth have happier people than those with lower levels.

That's the socialist view.

The good of the many outweighs the good of the few.

I'm all for income redistribution as long as it's VOLUNTARY on the part of the giver. Involuntary income redistribution is extortion.

gunnut, I agree with you on the moral level, but as a description of reality, ila is right. Democratic governments usually work on utilitarian principles in order to be re-elected, and that means balancing happiness to ensure that potential voters with a lower income are made happy without making the ones with money too unhappy.

Yes, but that doesn't make it right. But then again, is trying to provide a somewhat harmoneous and lawful society by depriving a small utility from a small portion of the society wrong?

Economically, it's wrong.

Property law wise, it's wrong.

But to provide an somewhat orderly society so those who have a lot may continue to have a lot and those who have little can have a bit more, could be worth the trade off.

Idealy, I would like to see those who have a lot give up some of their stuff willingly so we don't have to remove them by force. But then that's still extortion, in a way. The rich is basically buying protection from the mob.

This is like "kindness." Can one really be selfless? The fact that he feels good by helping others is a reward in and of itself. If there's a reward, that's not selflessness...

gunnut: Who's to say what is right and what is wrong? This is a philosophical question if you ask me. You could for example say how did the rich get rich? By exploiting the poor or using their labour or overpricing consumer goods. Therefore they got a moral obligation to pay back their wrongly accumulated wealth.

This isn't my personal opinion I'm only saying what the truth is depends on who you ask. Personally I think it's better to have more wealth to distribute even if some will get more than others (capitalism), than less total although evenly distributed (socialism/communism).

And I think ila puts too much importance into wealth regarding the happiness unit. It's no doubt one of the most important, but there might be other important units as well. This is a difficult question but let me make an example to prove my point. Some countries might have a tradition where families take care of their elderly when they get old. Those elderly might be more happy than those who live their last days in a home for the aged relatively alone. There are many other non-materialistic units which come into play regarding happiness.

There was just a new happiness report in the media a week ago. I will try to find it find out what units they used. What an interesting topic <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

One could say all that garbage, but one would be wrong to do so. If you own a factory, how is it exploitation to hire at market wages or sell at market prices? The factory belongs to you, you are under no obligation to provide jobs, therefore you have the right to pay whatever people are willing to accept (and that is where collective bargaining comes into play to balance things out for the workers). You are not keeping them in your factory at gun point. Similarly, the finished product belongs to you and you are under no obligation to give it to people at any price except the one you choose. "Overpriced" is something that can only be determined by the market. If it is overpriced it would not sell. If it sells it is selling because it is meeting market demand.

Of course if you want to go really far back in time (or to the present day in some third world countries) you could argue that a significant amount of wealth was wrongly accumulated if it was gained through slave labour, military conquest, murder, etc. But if you run with that idea then you have the problem of sorting out the decendents of those who got their wealth from moral means and immoral means. This is impossible, and therefore some redistribution through things like taxation, free or discounted education, and/or affirmative action is theoretically reasonable even though it wouldn't be in a perfectly enforced free market situation.

Found an interesting article about quality of life. Read it <a href="http://www.economist.com/theworldin/international/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3372495&amp;d=2005">here</a>.

Looks like they've come to the same conclusion as I did. Money isn't everything. Social and cultural structures is also very important units. Interesting to see that they rate both France and Germany ahead of UK in QoL.

<a href="http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf">Here's</a> the methodology.

Can't remember who said it but "social science isn't rocket science, it's much more complex. Anyone can calculate a trajectory in a vacuum".

Why Irish eyes are smiling

Where will be the best place to live in 2005? The World in 2005 turned to the Economist Intelligence Unit, which has devised a 2005 quality of life index for 111 countries. Result: Ireland comfortably tops the league. America, though the second-richest country (behind Luxembourg) in GDP per head, slips to 13th in quality of life. Britain languishes in 29th place.

It has long been accepted that material well-being alone does not adequately measure quality of life. Money matters, of course, but surveys suggest that over the decades big increases in income have translated into only a modest rise in satisfaction. Although rising incomes and expanded individual choice are highly valued, some of the factors associated with modernisationsuch as the breakdown of traditional institutions and the erosion of family valuesin part offset its positive impact.

But how to combine in a single, comparative statistic the factors believed to influence peoples happiness? There have been many attempts, none entirely successful: the factors selected, and the weights assigned to them, tend to be arbitrary. Subjective surveys of life satisfaction have been attracting growing interestespecially since the evidence is that people in different countries and cultures cite similar criteria for being contentedbut getting comparable surveys across many countries is hard and there is too much margin for error for a truly objective quality-of-life index.

So ours takes a new approach. We use life-satisfaction surveys (assembling the average scores for 74 countries) as a starting point for weighting the various factors that determine quality of life. A regression analysis suggests that as many as nine indicators have a significant influence, and can be turned into an equation explaining more than 80% of the variation in countries life-satisfaction scores. The main factor is income, but other things are also important: health, freedom, unemployment, family life, climate, political stability and security, gender equality, and family and community life. We feed the factors into the equation, measuring them using forecasts for 2005 where possible (in four cases) and latest data for slower-changing indicators, such as family life and political freedom. The resulting score, on a scale of one to ten, gives the quality-of-life index. A full explanation of the methodology and a full country ranking are available to download here.

Ireland wins because it successfully combines the most desirable elements of the new (the fourth-highest GDP per head in the world in 2005, low unemployment, political liberties) with the preservation of certain cosy elements of the old, such as stable family and community life. Offsetting its poor climate and, by rich-country standards, gender inequality are a higher political stability and security. Even if GNPnot available for all countries, but in Irelands case significantly lower than GDPis used to measure income, Ireland still wins.

Britain, by contrast, mixes high income per head with high levels of social and family breakdown; it comes bottom among the 15 countries of the pre-enlargement European Union. America ranks above the EU-15 average. Italy performs well but Germany and France do notbelying the notion that big euro-zone nations compensate for their economic sluggishness with a better quality of life than America.

China, for all the excitement over its development, still falls in the lower half of the league. Proud Russians will be disturbed to find themselves at the wrong end of the table. Bottom of the lot is Zimbabwe, where things have gone from bad to worse under Robert Mugabe.

In 1986, in response to an early attempt to measure well-being across countries, The Times scoffed: Can anyone really assess, in mathematical or other terms, the value of living in Britain? Well, they can tryon the basis of what people around the world themselves say about life satisfaction. No doubt critics will poke holes in this index too. Except, of course, in Ireland.

I read an interesting thing today, I think in the Atlantic Monthly. If Europe was a US state, it would be 47th in per capita GDP, ahead of West Virginia, Mississippi, and one other state. This is without including the Eastern European countries that were recently added. IIRC, France and UK have per capita GDPs comparable to Alabama.

Luxembourg, Ireland and the Nordic countries have the highest living standards of living, not only in Europe but the world in general - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index#Top_thirty_countries_.28HDI_range_from_0.965_down_to_0.885.29">Human Development Index - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>.

Of the three here, France has the highest standards of living (16th), followed by the UK (18th) and then Germany (21st).

Rather interesting - I find the the French very relaxed, they're certainly happier with life than the Brits (or that's the impression I've gotten from the short time I've spend in both lands).

The Germans are unusually pessimistic.

I would have picked The Netherlands. Labour laws that make sence protecting the employer and the employee. Relaxed prostitution and drug laws allow the police to do their job which is to arrest actual bad people. Rapes are lower there and so is drug addiction. Funny how people ask for help when they are not afraid of losing everything due to bad decisions. Also wht rape someone when for $50 you can nail someone way hotter than you'd ever get normally anyway.

The Netherlands is clean, it is so very clean it's awesome. The Dutch are wonderful people (if a little odd) and it is a welcoming country more or less. The only problem really is they are a little too liberal with their immigration laws which has the potential for future problems some of which we are seeing now but no more so than in the UK or Germany.

France, they can piss off. Lot's of poor whining bastards who think they are owed something they are not willing to work for. At least the food makes up for those lazy buggers.

Germany, what can I say. Great place to live but a bit too strict laws in my opinion.

The UK, violent but otherwise one of my favorites in places to live. I love the UK but the standard of living is piss poor for a lot of people in large cities.

The UK is definitely not the best place! Britain is a nice place to live in if you're rich, otherwise forget it.

You get taxed to the hilt, get little state support if you fall on hard times, and a really crap state pension at 65 - soon to go up to 68. People in the UK work the longest hours of anywhere else in Europe and have the least holidays, including only 8 state holidays a year - lower than any other country. And houses are now so expensive that the average 3 bed house costs 8 times the average salary.

The whole culture in Britain is one of envy, that's why progressive social measures are so deeply resented. People are fiercely individualistic, have little respect for authority, are utterly amoral and have no sense of community or social compassion.

Not to mention that there are deep seated social problems related to excessive alcohol consumption and youth crime. Kids as young as 12 consume alcohol and cigarettes, enjoy vandalising, harassing people and even initiate unprovoked violence in gangs.

I would compare Britain to Russia rather than France or Germany! And I'm being harsh on Russia. :( <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/mad.gif"/>

As for the highest standard of living in Europe, I would say Switzerland, Netherlands or the Scandinavian countries (except Finland and Iceland). German standard of living has gone down since the 1980s and France is very good if you have a job, but unemployment is high.

You still have the option to pay for the operation, and have it almost immediately. Or take out health insurance and again have rapid treatment.

I don't know what you mean by 'socialist' countries - the Communist block collapsed in 1989. Most European countries (Britain excepted) are social-democratic in outlook, which means they adopt some mild socialist measures within a capitalist, market economy.

So I'm paying twice? I pay for the government service that I don't use, and pay for the service I do use. How about an option to NOT pay for the government service and use only my own?

Universal health care is cheaper and better then private. America has one of THE worst health care systems in the industrialized world. Also consider this, without health care you die. Without an automobile you take the bus. When a large chunk of the population can't afford health care, you're looking at a humanitarian issue. I understand you're coming from a middle class perspective, but consider the growing number of lower class families, and the dropping buying power of the middle class. 50 years from now you might be grateful that the universal health care bill got passed when it did.

I agree. The state has some responsibilities to its people. How much is the question.

We believe the state should provide national defense, make treaties, mint money, regulate immigration, and provide postal services.

We don't want the state to tell us what kind of health insurance we should have, what school I should go to, provide me with retirement, insure me against unemployment, telling me what kind of food I can't eat, the list goes on and on.

All those services aren't free. Someone has paid for them. Since they are a function of the government, they will never go away. If I want to buy my own, I have to pay again.

Think you own your government? Think again. Tell your government to get rid of a program that you don't like. You can't. Ask your government if you can opt out of said program, keep it for others who like it. You can't. You are stuck.

Socialism if class warfare. Instead of motivating people to get better, it tells people to use the power of the mob to tear down those who work hard. If I hold an election asking people if they would pass a law that takes away money from the top 2% to pay for the bottom 98%, do you think it'll pass? It will. What happens to the top 2% after that? Doesn't matter, we'll go after the next 2%. Eventually everyone will do the absolute minimum to get by. It doesn't pay to do more.

Oh yeah? I was recently laid off and now I have to buy my own insurance. I did a lot of researches on the internet. I looked into all sorts of PPO, HMO, and compared them to my old company health care plan. Let me tell you, there are many affordable health care plans out there. There's something for everyone. I looked into a plan that DOES NOT include gynecology care. I don't need it. Guess what? They are generally cheaper. Under my company plan, it was included. I was subsidizing some women I don't know and don't care to have babies. I had no choice. The money was already taken out of my paycheck in the form of government tax on the businesses and the tax credit they get.

I never had to do this kind of research before. Now I am convinced more than ever that socialized medicine is a bad idea.

What defines the middle class? What defines the purchasing power of the middle class? A car? A fridge? A TV? A cell phone?

I posted an article I came across on MSN Money a while ago on this form. It stated that our "poor" people have things that some middle class in the world don't have access to. Something like 90% of our poor people have microwave; 70% have cable TV; and roughly half have cars. Why are these people "poor?"

I'm not against universal health care system. I just want people to have the chance to opt out of paying for it and using it. You can pay the government for it and use it. I want to keep my money and buy my own care from a private company. It's about choice. Socialism does not offer choices. It believes people are too stupid to choose. So it puts a bunch of people in a committee and choose for other people.

Our Government doesn't do that either!

GM food is the closest thing to that I can think of, and I'm fecking glad we did, that crap is just not edible when your used to excellent natural produce - plus I prefer to buy Irish food anyway, as we refuse to tamper with our meat just to maximise profits.

I disagree - Progressive taxing is an effective way to bring a bit more equality to our shared western society - I'm in the Upper-Middle Income bracket of this nation, and as I said, 42% is a figure I happily pay, because it's being spend on roads, hospitals, welfare for those who need it (they DO exist, you know?) and building a better future for us all through good public services - I refuse to believe that's somehow "wrong".

I have a question for you. I understand you pay 42% tax and you think you are getting a good return on your money. Do you really enjoy not having a choice on where you go for your services?

What do you pay that 42% taxes on? Health care, education, I guess infrastructure.

What do you use the rest of your money for? Do you buy your own food? Do you pay rent or mortgage on your residence?

What would you say to a measure to increase your taxes, but providing you with basic food needs and living arrangement? You'll get the basics like water, some soft drinks, beer, whiskey, flour products, meat products, vegies, and fruit. You get a card from the government for your monthly grocery needs at government stores. Of course if you want more or exotic food you will have to pay extra at privately owned stores.

How about apartment? An extra tax will get you a basic apartment, anywhere in the nation, as long as there are vacancies. That way you don't have to deal with mortgages, monthly rent, and it's an insurance against unemployment.

Are you against these measures?

Homeless in Europe,

Tourist visit some parts of Paris go beyond the Louvre,

Germany, poverty, homeless,

Uk, too.

Europe is portrait in the media both in America and abroad as a model of wealth and prosperity,

But those the majority of Europeans citizens feel the same, way?

Why there since more than 20 years ago, in France more than 35&amp;#37; of college graduates still are looking for employment, why the feeling of there is not hope? which brougth Nicolas to power?

why in Germany, the dirty reality the great number of people getting poorer, because of lack of employment, running out of their welfare benefits

and in UK, under the gloss the same,

Medicine, School, Housing

reality, in UK, the socialized medicine is driving patients away, big goverment burochracy has created a system full of low performer employees
which a increasingly health staff who lack ethical, compassion and dedication
also multiculturism and destruction of meritocracy in favor of ideological, political promotions from doctors to the rest of the staff has inflicted a mortal wound to the British Health Care system
Why then Patients are fleeing fthe free care in UK to pay for care abroad?
because in practice is so wonderful? If it is so wonderful why to go abroad to pay for medical services when in UK i s free

France, the socialized system, is responsible of situations such
doctor punch out and a patient drop in the floor in front of them, plus increasingly suffering of the same destruction of meritocracy

I punch out, walk away,

Germany so lauded, is having super strained both in care, in funding and treatment.

Hospital are order to prescribed and treat in certain ways, goverment regulations interfere with proper treatment

So yes free medicine but not the oasis and Paradise Promise by their advocates in America

Education,

the lowering of standard which the UK, France, Germany, including the introduction of Multicultural and experimental curriculum has produce a dumb and dumber generation, which compete with the American's ones

in who is having lower level of literarcy either in Sciences or Liberal Arts
from grammar school to college

Americans learn a lot from Europe, from extremist birth control, which even NPR acknowledge a factor in the great decline of European population present economic standards to educational experiement and multicultural which makes Europe a great example ( curriculum matters ) how decades of free school and Increasing spending in educations keep producing great numbers of low educated, low performer student at all levels and how Europe is full of generation of European born, Fundamentalist, willing to try impose Sharia law either by force or by vote anwho learn not just from European Right e but from European Left, you are not European, this is not your culture and they do not feel any attachment to Europe.
They almost won in UK when Sharia law just failed to pass in the British parlament for less than 10
votes

In Europe many inmigrants collect money without working collect benefits without working and due to the European law a inmigrant even illegal, can manage to be send money, thousands of euros to the place where he lives
and did you wonder where he lives? NO in europe in Africa, Middle East erc
Europe elite is so smart, like the BBC, ( so loved in America and so Orwellian in reporting ) that they establshed laws which allow so without being citizen or reside in European soil. No wonder money is getting worse, all the entitlement and all the money taking from the treasure ?

Did officials, Brusels

Do they care? a big Noooooooooooooo
Segregated school, Multicultural school, have been in vogue in Europe for decades, they are proven center of Terrorist nest, homegrown terrorist
but in America, who learn so much for Europe, they are growing ?

And Housing, the Golden portrait of Europe is a wonderful example where America should go for models of housing

Go to Lyons, go to Bristol, go to Hamburg,

Housing, Housing, Housing

Big problem, big b ig

Journalists due to ideoligical reason abstain for indiscriminated reported and the lack the inquisitive mind of an Oriana for example

Watch American TV, or read the paper,

The new generations of american journalist, many coming for the elite journalist school with the chest full of Academic achievement

Lack the Walter Conkrite,
Lack the old Edward inquisitive mind

Lack the old journalist broader perspective

they are most of them, trained ideologes

Welcome to Super Europe, Welcome to her mirror sister, the New America

In theory putting the benefits, salaries in theory will be Germany, suffering from chronic, massive economic labor unemployment, increasingly rates of homelesness, broke down education, and health care system in increasing state of deteorition the

He uses a lot of anecdotal examples. He openly asks for health care horror stories and then puts them in his movies. Just count how many of those stories he goes through in his movie against how many people we have in this country.

Human consciousness registers the exeptions better than the norm. That's why it always seems kids put on the wrong shoe first. When they put the right shoe on first, we don't pay attention to it.

In his movie he states there are 45 million (or 50 million) "Americans" without health care. First of all, many of these people are not Americans. We have 20 million illegals. I bet most of them don't have health insurance. They shouldn't have been here in the first place. Secondly, statistics show that 5% of the population is always "in between" jobs. Most of those people don't have insurance as they are in a transition point. I don't have insurance right now because my company insurance ended and the plan I bought is delayed.

Then there are people who make enough money to pay for things out of pocket. The money they save is either insignificant or they have a better use for this money, i.e. investing in the market for greater than 20% gain per year. Do you think Bill Gates or Steve Jobs buy health insurance? I bet they don't. The places they go if they get sick probably don't take insurance plans.

How about those legal foreign nationals? If you were to move here for a job, do you think you would buy our health insurance? No. Why not? You can go back to Ireland for care. But you are here. And you would count among the "45 million uninsured Americans" in his movie.

Michael Moore is a master at manipulating emotions. He seldom use statistics, especially those that don't agree with his view" in his movies. It's much easier to influence a movie audience with emotional stories with the actual people on screen than using a bunch of numbers and facts. They just don't make good movies. Which is easier to show the horrors of the war? A personal storie about a soldier's life on the frontlines, fighting for his life, witnessing death and destruction, losing friends on a daily basis? Or citing you a bunch of numbers on how many people died on this day and how many people are projected to die if we attack this position?

It's expensive here because government meddled in it.

This came out of WW2. Back then, Roosevelt froze prices on everything, including wages. To get more people to work more hours, companies offered subsidized health care. It was kind of a loophole the feds didn't anticipate. And then due to various tax codes (the most complex, incomprehensible piece of crap in human history), corporations can write off employee health plan expenditure as an operational cost. Corporations used this as a tax shelter, deducting costs from earnings. Employees only have to pay a very small percentage of it.

Here's where human nature comes in. When something is perceived to be free, people use more of it. Health care is virtually free for working Americans. So any time anything goes wrong, we run to the hospital, getting the best, most prompt, and most expensive treatment available. Hey, it's free. The doctors are only too happy to order the most expensive procedures because they make more money. They bill the insurance companies. The insurance companies in turn distributes this cost across the entire industry. The end result is cost goes up year after year, especially when new treatments are available at a very high cost. You know, like research and developing F-22 rather than buy existing and proven F-15E that can do the job, just not as fast and not as well.

My point, and a lot of conservatives here believe that if we were to have a free market based system, health care cost would come down. We pay for what we need, weighing various factors like time, level of care, a cheaper hospital....etc. We will no longer buy the most expensive and fastest at all times. Doctors will have to give us options rather than just order whatever makes more money. With the advent of the internet, the consumers have information flowing downstream in a meaningful manner for the first time in history. We will be able to determine who the quacks are and who the honest doctors are. Look at how successful Ebay is at keeping people honest.

That you could. But your system might eventually have problems like the Canadian system.

Many Canadians are coming over here for emergency care because their hopitals simploy don't have enough beds. Surgeries are scheduled 6 months in advance, or you won't get it. What if I need something within a week?

British system is experiencing the same problem. The law requires the system to provide care within 48 hours after the patient calls. Do you know how they get around that? The hospital will tell the patient to call back in 5 days because the soonest they can schedule anything is in 7 days. I heard this on a townhall meeting of Tony Blair (or was it the health minister?).

Maybe it's a small population. Maybe it's the homogenous population. Your system seems to work as advertised. Only time will tell. I personally believe all socialized system will eventually fail.

I would say it's a kind of idea of which I can think of only a few negatives, but wouldn't be happy to impliment it anyway, for various reasons.

Why won't you be happy to have this system? The government will provide you with the essentials. There will be a government committee that convenes every now and then to update the requirement. You no longer have to spent time to shop for the best bargains. You can concentrate on working.

Commentary

Revision of results : After the 2005 census, INSEE population estimates based on annual vital statistics and benchmarked to census results were revised for the entire 2000-2005 period. This has entailed a revision of the absolute numbers of persons computed from Labor-Force Surveys. By contrast, percentage rates have remained almost unchanged.

By the way, I suggest to read the reports from
France

Financial Times,
The Economist
among others

European youth feel very negative about their future and opportunities in major nations such as France

1984. Orwell understood very well how self denial of reality works
even before the night fall upon free societies, and in Europe, not just the economy but what remains of the elements which make a society free, from free inquire, free speech, free exchange of ideas, to
accountability is going down the drain. France was able to stall the fall with the real person, Nicolas election, a politician who despite of whatever differences I or anyone can has with his views, at least is a refreshing entrance, on camera and off camera is more real than any of the other cadre of politicians, a bunch of photogenic, actor like politicians who ( Like the Clinton's read Dee Dee Myer and G. St, former assistant in the Clinton W.H) charming in public but mean of spirit in private) or like many others regardless of their ideology, very crowd pleaser in public but ruthless and harsh in their treatment toward friend and associates in private
Nicolas as 60 minutes shows, does not hide his ways, bravo
he does not cover up his character and temper, I maybe do not like his temper but I like his honesty

In UK the weather and food are definitely too bad.
And there are a lot of reasons to avoid France und zu go in Germany : in France you can find more unemployment, dirties cities, more crimes, riots, and bombs, a lot of funny english jokes about what's happened in 1940, and even one of the last communist parties. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>
When you live in Germany and you miss France too much, choose a place near France and Swizz, and it will be perfect.

About health care :

<quote orig_author="gunnut">
I'm not against universal health care system. I just want people to have the chance to opt out of paying for it and using it. You can pay the government for it and use it. I want to keep my money and buy my own care from a private company. It's about choice. Socialism does not offer choices. It believes people are too stupid to choose. So it puts a bunch of people in a committee and choose for other people.

</quote>

I can imagine a system in which people have the choice : "state health care or private insurance, what do you prefer for you and your family ?" No problem for me.
That makes me remember a discussion. A few weeks ago, someone said me something like "I pay too much for the french state health care, I don't need health care so much and I lost money". I said "Well, OK. But if you had the choice, what would you do ? Go out of the system and find a cheaper private company for you, your wife, and your children ? In the future, all you'll need is in the deal between you and your company (or the next one), don't ask me and the other tax-payers to spend an Euro for your family's health if the company doesn't want. Would you sign for this ?" The answer was no.

The French unemployment rates generally hobble around 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points below the German ones. Gap's closing a bit recently, i think.
Dirty cities... ever been to the Ruhrpott, Berlin or Ludwigshafen? *brr*
As for riots and bombs... nah, not really. They tend to be more localized in France, and i'm not only talking about the banlieus. In Germany, these tend to be spread out far more, perhaps owing to the federal structure instead of France centralism.
Crime... Germany 6.3 million "incidents" in the official statistics, i.e. 76 per 1,000 ppl on average. No idea about France.

Btw, healthcare?

Germany has this dual-path opt-out concept. There's a basic requirement for everyone to have insurance, however the insurance itself is provided by private companies, with competition among them - not by a government-sponsored agency like with the NHS.
The social element of these private insurance companies is maintained by a centralized redistribution fond between these (iirc several hundred) companies.

Once you're above a certain pay bracket (meaning you can viably support this financially too), you can additionally opt out of the usual "basic coverage" package deals of the socalled legal health insurance (which uses earnings-based variable premiums at certain rates) and opt for customized coverage concepts with private insurance (which uses customized premiums).

As for high tax rates... German tax law (on the employee's side) breaks down into:

18.9% - income tax (sliding scale)
9.95% - pension (fixed percentage)
7.30% - health insurance (average; 6.8-7.8% depending on provider)
1.65% - unemployment insurance (fixed percentage)
1.00% - "solidarity" payment for East Germany (fixed percentage)
0.85% - care insurance (fixed percentage)

Tax class I (single), scaled for income around 35,000 EUR/annum. Above are mandatory payments, total 39.65%. Income Tax gets roughly halved if you're in Tax Class III (married, split tax, low-tax class).

So you favor a system based around a manager that in order to increase his paycheck influence and otherwise, needs to increase the size of his department. This in turn means he needs to have things to keep these people busy, which involves adding as much inefficiency as they can away with. As the power comes from the top down they can for the most part just give the finger to the people they're serving.

On the other hand you could have a system where the manager lives in mortal terror of doing anything to piss off the people using their services because if they did they'd instantly begin losing the dollar-votes necessary for them to continue operation. Plus they will tend to want to run things as efficiently as possible so as to maximize the portion of the profit pie they can take for themselves.

Any decently large company by the Law of Large Numbers basically represents a slice that is effectively equivalent to the whole, and this type of business doesn't reduce inefficiencies significantly by increasing their scale like say phone companies. Thus you realistically are just choosing between the two management strategies. If you want to enhance the effectiveness of the second all you'd have to do is break the company based healthcare system and otherwise encourage increased competition between the companies.

That's a strange paradox with socialists. They admit government is inefficient and corrupt, but at the same time they want the government to run every aspect of their lives. All inefficiencies and corruption can be cured by dumping more money and enact more rules and regulations.

The other thing about that is Health Insurance isn't about EMS services really. Yes if you have health insurance it'll contribute towards paying for EMS care, but if you don't the government covers it.

This is about guys getting their symptom suppressing meds, Viagra, and usually not entirely necessary antibiotics. Just try to tell me with a straight face this isn't what most of the pay out will amount to. Proper use of clean water allows for survival in regards to such things and you can ride out the symptoms just like people did before the 1940-50s. Plus pools can be setup for the rare operations and that sort of thing, which pretty much removes overhead fees like present with say a government agency.

As someone that's iffy about most medication on the market on general principle and taken some time to study medicine and its history I'm just not even really buying the concept health insurance is a necessity as opposed to a luxury. If you think I'm just a nut for being really iffy about the meds go ahead and ask EMS personnel about regs about giving anybody _anything_ and why they're in place. Then there's the WHO position on the whole thing...

I'm not really sure how your post fits in or what exactly your ranting at, but I figured I'd point out that the phara industry profits are only 2% of health care costs. We can rail against Viva La Viagra, but it's simply chump change in the grand scheme of things.

I would have picked The Netherlands. Labour laws that make sence protecting the employer and the employee. Relaxed prostitution and drug laws allow the police to do their job which is to arrest actual bad people. Rapes are lower there and so is drug addiction. Funny how people ask for help when they are not afraid of losing everything due to bad decisions. Also wht rape someone when for $50 you can nail someone way hotter than you'd ever get normally anyway.

The Netherlands is clean, it is so very clean it's awesome. The Dutch are wonderful people (if a little odd) and it is a welcoming country more or less. The only problem really is they are a little too liberal with their immigration laws which has the potential for future problems some of which we are seeing now but no more so than in the UK or Germany.

A lot is true but we criticize our police alot because we still think they can do a better job. The immigration laws are very strict now. I can't see any future immigration problems. We got a lot of Bulgarian and Polish immigrants here right now. But damn those Bulgarian and Polish women are hott. Most of the girls now working in the red light districts are Bulgarian and Polish, but they are so hott!! Dutch people are indeed a little odd, but The Netherlands is just one big rural area <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/> The cities here aren't that big the only big city we got is Amsterdam (according to worldcity standards).

France, they can piss off. Lot's of poor whining bastards who think they are owed something they are not willing to work for. At least the food makes up for those lazy buggers.

I havent have very great experience with Frence people, i find them very rude. And they always expect you to talk French even when you are on vacation! <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/> But that's just my experience maybe i've just met the wrong people. Why don't they speak English!!!!

<quote>
Germany, what can I say. Great place to live but a bit too strict laws in my opinion.
</quote>

Germany is cool, but the people are also rude at first. If you got to know them they are very nice. I prefer Germany over France.

<quote>
The UK, violent but otherwise one of my favorites in places to live. I love the UK but the standard of living is piss poor for a lot of people in large cities.
</quote>

I love the UK. Although the living standard in The Netherlands is higher London is a very cool City. It is very multicultural and the people are very nice. The indian girls look very good damn! <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

Highest standart of living I think it would be a draw between Germany and France (having lived in, or at least visited for Germany, the three countries)

First the important things :

the girls: the hotties are in France (I confirm), OK girls in UK, average in Germany

the food: France, Germany (first for the beers) and GB in that order.

the people : the Germans, by far, are the most friendly (I don't even want to talk about the two others)

cost of living : to live in Germany is very affordable, compared to France and UK of course..

freedom/tolerance towards foreigners : GB (mainly because they don't care about you), then Germany and France last ( I'm a little harsh for France but that's the way it is)

Health care : dead last is GB (you don't see French crossing the channel to get hospitalized in UK, more the other way around)

Education : cheapest with a good enough level is France but I don't know for Germany..

economic opportunities/ best place for entrepreneurship: well you already know the ranking I guess..

I guess travel magazines aren't so boring anymore...

Countries With The Most Beautiful Women

Some of you may have read my article on cities with the most beautiful women, this however is about the countries with the most beautiful women. It's always possible to find a city with beautiful women in a land of not-so-amazingly beautiful women. These places on the other hand, are entire countries with beautiful women.

10. Denmark
I've been to Denmark many times, &amp; I can say that I've not found anything rotten there to date. And definitely not the women, the women here are as striking as they come. A lot like their Swedish neighbours, the women of Denmark are remarkable in their beauty &amp; their charm.

9. Netherlands
Dutch girls have to be some of the world's most amazing. Sure I'm only ranking the country as number nine, which is good when you take into account how many nations there are on this earth. But this list is only taking beauty into consideration, Dutch women have more than that, they're complete, they're incredible, they're the kind of girls who hang out drinking wine in the park with you randomly philosophizing, &amp; they're also the kind of girls who will makeout with you in that same very park. (If they like you of course, this is not a poor country, it's about who you are, the girls here aren't impressed by status or anything like that.)

8. Estonia
Ahh &amp; now the Eastern European countries come into play. Estonia is a very small country, &amp; seemingly insignificant, but it's astonishing if only because of the girls. Beautiful they are, you can find some of the world's best looking women in any nightclub in Tallinn's Old Town, on any day of the week.

7. Ukraine
The Black Sea coast of the Ukraine is world famous for gorgeous girls in scantily clad bathing suits. And rightly so, but more so than that the entire country is filled to the brims with beautiful women. From Odessa to Kiev, the Ukraine beauty.

6. Belarus
It's often been said that Eastern Europe is the valley of beautiful women, &amp; in that context Belarus is one of the more fertile spots. Sure the country may be drab, dreary, &amp; socialist architecture reigns supreme, but the women are to die for. They manage to turn this country from extremely boring, to a place you never want to leave.

5. Latvia
Where I sit as of the time I write this article. Latvia is just wondrous. This little Baltic nation, such a small country, with hardly no international fame or reputation, is home to some of the world's most beautiful girls hands down. Drop-dead beauties roam the streets, &amp; they're friendly too, can't beat that now can you?

4. Bulgaria
Bulgaria may as well change its name to "Beautyland" as it is a proverbial theme park of beautiful women. Everything from dark hair to light, &amp; from bright eyes to well brighter eyes. Bulgaria is filled with amazing women all the way from the mountainous region of the capital Sofia to the beautiful beaches on the Black Sea coast.

3. Russia
This list has pretty much read out as an Eastern European geography lesson, &amp; with good reason. Slavic women are the most beautiful overall in the world, &amp; Russia is the big leagues as far as Eastern Europe goes. The women here are not only beautiful, they're seductive. With one glance they can capture your heart, they look at you as if they know they could do anything in the world &amp; you'd like it, &amp; basically that's true.

2. Argentina
Argentina is definitely the cream of the crop as far as Latin America, well really as far as the whole Western Hemisphere goes. Argentineans, specifically those of Buenos Aires are a people made up mostly of Italian migrants from the 19th &amp; early 20th century, but I must say that they must have been migrants from Milan all with super model genes, because the people here are stunning.

1. Sweden
Of course Sweden lands at the number one spot. How could it not, it's Sweden for goodness sake! The women here are so ridiculously beautiful that it's hard to breathe sometimes when in their presence. Blond hair, &amp; bright eyes, personalities that are beautiful to match, what more could anyone ever ask for?

Wow. That photo's almost NSFW!

Evidently she's a singer or some other form of celebrity?

</quote>

Yes; her name is Haife Wehbe, and she's a huge hit over in the Middle East with the more moderate societies. She's a "popular" singer and sometime actor (she has a few music videos). Obviously, she's probably not allowed to enter Iran or Syria, but most of the other Middle Eastern countries regard her as a celebrity, and a fairly progressive one at that. She usually sings in her native tongue, but I think she has a few songs in English (don't quote me on that).

Boy ! Before reading this thread i thought WAB comprises of very serious people.
Now its changed.

My foreign experience is only in nepal, thailand, canada(toronto). I was too small during the canada trip to remember any faces.

Nepal has very UGLY looking ladies.

In india the city girls possess complete eye-turning capacity.
And by the way, around twenty girls from Lahore grammar school had come for a student exchange in my school. And they were the true virtual definition of PRETTY and all its synonyms.
I even got a goodbye peck from one of them, <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>, will never forget that.

Girls and teachers from all countries visit my school including canda, england, us etc. But no one was as pretty as those pakistanis.

The desert states of northern Mexico have the best women. I've been there. All of the Mexican TV babes are from there, and the Mexicans themselves have this stereotype that the best-looking people come from the northern part of their country, kind of like how we Americans say California is full of hot women (but in reality it's not any better than anywhere else here).

The reason for this: Northern Mexico was sparsely populated, so when the Spanish moved in, they interbred with the native peoples in just the right mix to produce the hottest women.

We couldn't get near any, it appeared to be a very old fashioned male dominated culture. I don't recall even seeing one single woman serving in a bar/restaurant in those small towns. Let alone be frequenting any establishment.

My male colleague did get chatted up by a nice man in a restaurant though, and I was propositioned by a teenage school girl in the street at lunchtime one day in Kakinada!

OK I'll bite. I haven't been everywhere but I give a few.

Israel. Very sexy, it's a very fit and healthy culture, but the women don't give Americans the time of day.
French Canada. Not quite American, not quite European, a little 'o both.
Peru. Not all of them, but there is a segment of Peruvian women who seem to have the European/Indigenous thing in perfect balance.
Italy. Good lawd. Mediterranean heaven. Feisty too.
Hungary. This is the biggest surprise. I didn't expect it either, but the women of Budapest are the most attractive in non-Meditteranean Europe in my opinion. Something about that Ural Mountain ancestry.

I'm going to take the easy way out. America has the best looking women. Because we are a vast cornucopia of all the worlds women squeezed into one country.

In fact, in our larger cities, you can do a "Women of the world tour" without leaving the city limits <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

Another note, I've been to around 30 countries. All of them have women that are "Drop dead gorgeous". And all have some that are"coyote ugly".

OK I didn't see any DDG women in Sierra Leone. But they may have been in hiding

Where to Find the Worlds Hottest Women
By Robin Esrock

Exotic, foreign beauties have drawn men to travel through the ages just as surely as power and wealth. In no particular order, this is my personal list, and why.

Chances are Ill end up at a bar with a bunch of guys, and most likely the fact that Ive travelled all over the world will come up, in which case the topic of which countries have the most beautiful women will DEFINITELY come up. We are men after all, and exotic, foreign beauties have drawn men to travel through the ages just as surely as power and wealth. In no particular order, this is my personal list, and why. Ladies, bearing in mind the overall silliness of this article, feel free to share your own list of the worlds hottest men.

1. Argentina

Latino girls dressed to kill with an attitude to match, theres no shortage of head turners in Argentina. I remember sitting at a coffee shop in Buenos Aires, amazed at the sheer amount of bombshells walking past me. Where did they all come from? Where do they all go? I got one warm lead who played me like violin throughout the week. I should have known better. I was forewarned that girls in Argentina like their soup warm, meaning, they like to keep their dating options open, but are notoriously non-committal.

2. Brazil

Well now, everything youve heard about Brazilian girls is true Im afraid. The way they dress with dental floss. The way they wear their sexuality so openly. The way they brazenly dont waste any time. But by far the best aspect of Brazilian girls is the way they move; the way a drum beat shakes their bodies (and their booties) like nowhere else. Theyre also loving, loyal, and wonderfully generous. I should knowIm dating one.

3. Colombia

My last country in South America is Colombia, which battles with Venezuela for the most internationally recognized beauty queens. Granted its a little strange how acceptable and encouraged cosmetic surgery is, and a little sad too. These are beautiful women, no improvements necessary. At a night club in Bogota I couldnt believe how genuinely friendly the girls were, and there were plenty of them. Colombia has a reputation for women outnumbering men by eight to one!

4. Israel

Its no surprise to me that the latest it-supermodel is an Israeli named Bar Rafaeli. The women in Israel are not only beautiful, they are fiercely spirited too. This is natural when you consider that every one of them has spent two full years in the army, learning how to defend themselves, learning to be warriors. Flirting with a stunning girl in an army uniform, an Uzi swung around her waist, is an interesting, and yet undoubtedly electrifying experience.

5. Ukraine/Russia

Male travellers walking the busy streets of cities like Kiev, Moscow and St Petersburg are forgiven if they stop and stare. Its impossible not too. With cheekbones that could carve a thanksgiving turkey, Russians and Ukrainian women dress like theyre going to ballroom dances at 8am in the morning. Short skirts, heels so tall they could be stilts, theyve got it, and theyre determined to use it.

6. Romania

Still in Eastern Europe, Romania features on my list because of that hot summer day in Bucharest where it appeared to me that the entire female population had burned their bras. With the low cut summer dresses displaying a very distracting amount of jiggle, its no wonder the men drive like crazy.

7. France

A bit of a personal toss-up here between the women of Italy and the women of France. I went with the French for no other reason than the girls there seem less harassed, and therefore a little more comfortable going out in public.

8. Japan

Into Asia now, and how I remember the girls of Tokyo! The eccentric way they dress, their strange customs (if you get a chance, dont miss the Harajuku girls gathering in all their gothic fantasy glory). While theres an unmistakable steeliness behind the cheekbones of Eastern European, in Japan theres a softness and a gentleness that can be intoxicating for Japanese men and for geijins (foreigners) too.

9. Philippines

Asian women are beautiful, period. Im adding Filipino girls because theyve been wooing men from around the world for centuries, and it was very easy for me to see why. Petite and friendly, I know theres a stigma attached to the word cute but I use it (along with all the other adjectives on this page) in its most flattering sense.

10. Canada

Of course! Ladies of Canada, I salute you. Not the Australians, South Africans, the English, nor the women of the United States can compare. Whether its the girls of the West Coast, dressed in their form-fitting yoga wear, the feisty prairie girls, the style and sass of Ontario and Quebec, the down home wholesomeness of the East Coast, guys travelling about in Canada gather in bars and freak the hell out. Theres just so many! said two English guys I met in a downtown bar, and they werent talking about maple leaf trees. Canadian women can stand the cold, turn up the heat, and easily rock the runway of any laddish list of this sort.

Beauty being subjective, I can assure all readers that every one of the 85 countries Ive visited, on all six continents, has no shortage of beautiful, smart and incredible women, gorgeously represented in an endless variety of wonderful shapes and sizes.

Likewise for Australia. On a shopping trip today I was met with beauty after beauty from what appeared to be every populated continent.

Our mix is a bit different to the US. Higher percentage of mediterranean, Irish, East Asian &amp; Sth Europe. Growing number of Sth Asian. Fewer of African descent, though increasing numbers of Africans. Few from Latin America (so far). We cover everyone - a visual feast.

At any rate, when one starts off as a body double, it is not surprising.

Still, in a life where one can find themselves in a Class B fire pretty quick.......a nylon based bra is one the last things you want to find yourself in!

My compliments to the photographer and the model; together, they have produced an image that definetly have people hooked.

One can just stare and fall in love with that body......though, when one gets down to the reality of it, of what they might actually be able to accomplish with that body, it sort of breaks apart.

So one just stares, and dreams of what they would do with that body without really thinking of just what they would do with that body.

Is that what you want, what you are thinking about when you have one hand in the middle of her back, bending her back to expose her neck, her throat to your kisses as you feel the warmth, the rising heat radiate from her chest as your other hand moves from rise to low to rise again and back? Are you thinking about her perkiness as your lips move from her throat to her lips to embrace the very life of her as you share breath at first but then extend the fury of your lungs into hers?

Are you really thinking about her personality......or just her dynamite?

Thank you........

......it's what I've learned over the years on how to do it though over the past 25 years, it's mostly sourced in how the military taught me to do deception, what I need to, say, be so take the other's mind off and away from active thought.

Sorry about that guys, to yank that rug of passion out from under you.

These days, the lessons I'm learning from acting is getting involved with. For the part I am playing, what part do I need to play, where and who is that energy coming from (ie, I am probably modeling it off of someone), and what affect do I desire to cause on the person I am doing it to or who is watching.

Now, I'm not an actress compared to my classmates, far from it, but I am learning procedures and mental techniques to be able to accomplish what I need to do.

For Catherine Bell, I just asked "the systems" for being the girl being with her......with enough of the boy mixed in. I wrote it as I saw it, as I felt it with the profile "the systems" were giving me......with a reserved touch so not to get an R rating.

But did I feel it? Of course I did......but maybe not as myself. That's part of the mental techniques I'm building, to be in that personality with my own "turned off". The built personalty has access to my memories, my experiences, my "sub systems", it is aware of "me", but in true activated sense (which btw, the last time I did it called for about 45 minutes of meditation to reach the state and after an hour, there were difficulties in maintaining it), I'm being that person.

Oh, and by the by, in the back and forth on this subject, I was doing to a degree the mental techniques to get to that point. So it wasn't all it once.

Lucy Lawless is making a long-awaited return to TV early next year with Starz most ambitious project yet, Spartacus: Blood and Sand.

The series stars Lawless (Xena: Warrior Princess) as Lucretia, John Hannah (The Mummy) as her husband, Batiatus, and Andy Whitfield as Spartacus.

Think 300 meets The Tudors, and youve got Spartacus. Sure enough, the promo clip features mass quantities of nudity, sex, blood, torture and violence, and you can feel the fanboys in the room perk up as this uncut version plays, and practically jump out of their chairs when they find out Lawless will have nude scenes in this series.

We start the first season before Spartacus is sent into slavery, and well end it when he breaks out, says executive producer Rob Tapert. Theres very little written about that period, so we have a lot of leeway. We took it a step further, and he actually becomes a gladiator. He gets sucked into the limelight, and its only later that he discovers its a lie.

Sam Raimi, the mastermind behind Spider-man, is also on tap as an exec producer, although filming in the web-slingers most recent instalment will mean Raimi will be absent for most of the series schedule.

The series is based on the legendary Roman soldier who defied a Roman Legate and was sentenced to die in the gladiator, arena only to be commuted after continuously winning his battles, and sold as a slave.

Spartacus: Blood and Sand is currently filming in New Zealand and will air on Starz early next year.

No, one for the men who like looking at what they think are Lesbians.

If they were Lesbians, there would probably be at least one shot where their breasts are intermingled.

Which do you prefer before your beer? Lipstick or butch?

For the benefit of our viewers at home:

lipstick lesbians are more feminine; it is more a use of the mouth.
butch are more masculine; they tend to borrow from the boys with attachments.

Of course, if one watches adult movies, they are usually made for men and they usually combine the two styles, using both techniques with very feminine players.

Though the mixtures may not be clear. I mean, after all, Sharon Kane when she is torturing poor little Saber may come across as something of a d*ke.....but I don't think anyone would mistake her as a man. At least, and live to talk about it.

Hmmmm, I don't know if I can say it otherwise without getting an R Rating.

Ummmmm, think of Malcolm McDowell in "A Clockwork Orange" in play before he went to prison.......only think of him as a girl dressed like that. Then you may have a mental picture of "Butch".

Quite frankly, every time I look at this one, it looks like she is going in for a choke with a combination arm bar.
Between that and doing it with sand paper, errrr, in the sand....it's rough sex indeed.

I am not very much into caucasians. I think Mediterranean girls are very beautiful. Personally, I like Asians, although the chi nky-eyes, white beauty gets boring. I prefer brown beauties. I find women from the Philippines very interesting. I like the variety in their mixed races.

First of all, cause blowing $hit up is fun.

Second of all, because when I get home all tired from reserves, I can get her to clean my rifle. (Wishful thinking)

Third of all, because guns are sexy, and chicks with guns are sexy as well. I even got a girlfriend to play along once and let me take some pictures. Real shame my computer crashed...

Besides, most of the ladies here know how to use an M-16, anyway. Since I plan on going local instead of for an import, might as well pick someone who knows how to use it well, no?

2.) Snow Leopard had hot fingers. The rest of her needs resurrection upon promise of a verifiable photo-AND approval by vote of said photo.

3.) Lipstick lesbians accepted. I love the challenge. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/>

Could be but, if so, the scenery was first rate.

I met her in a club
down in old Soho
where you drink champagne
and it tastes just
like cherry cola
C-O-L-A cola

She walked up to me
and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name
and in a dark brown voice
she said Lola
L-O-L-A Lola
la la la la Lola

Well I'm not the world's
most physical guy
but when she squeezed me tight
she nearly broke my spine
oh my Lola

So my GIRLFRIEND and I take a trip out to Quebec in the late summer of '78. Saw Springsteen in NYC that August and then the train along the Hudson to Montreal, on up to Quebec and back again to Montreal.

We want a beer after all afternoon on a train from Quebec so we go into this bar near the train station. Friday evening early. We try to go in. It's all lit up and full of people drinking after work. Looks fine. So I push the door open. It pushes back. What's this about? Cissy (all 5'0" and beautiful cantonese) looks at me puzzled. Try again because we can SEE through the door and there's definitely people there. Push again. This time it opens. Big guy looks at us. WE look at him. The whole bar turns and looks at us. Ain't a woman in sight but for Cissy and nobody's smiling. Stupid S-2 still hasn't caught on.

Cissy has. She tugs on my sleeve,

"Uh, S-2.

Yeah?

Wrong place.

"Wrong place?

Wrong place. We gotta go."

Guess they could tell Americans just by the sight of us, huh?

No, this one actually was an employee of mine. The first day she made me about a hundred bucks, which was great. The next three weeks, not that great... Plus, she started shacking up with another one of my workers, and his performance started slipping. Amazing, as soon as I canned her, he went back to making himself (and me) mucho dinero

Singapore locks up U.S. man for possessing porn Thu Aug 25,11:18 AM ET

Singapore police handcuffed and locked up a U.S. citizen for bringing 58 pornographic DVDs and video CDs into the wealthy city-state when he moved to Singapore last year, a newspaper reported Thursday.

The Straits Times said Singapore state prosecutors had dropped charges of possessing uncertified and obscene films against Tran Nghia Hong after he presented them with a declaration by his brother, stating that he was missing "certain DVDs."

The films, found by Singapore customs officers in a shipment of his belongings from California, included titles such as "Frivolous Lola," "Copulation Nation" and "Lord of the Strings."

"I was handcuffed and put in a lock-up for four hours after I was charged," the report quoted Tran, 35, as saying.

Tran, a financial controller at U.S. Internet equipment maker Cisco Systems, could have been fined up to S$500 for each disc, up to a maximum of S$20,000, or up to six months in prison, or both.

Despite efforts to loosen some of its social controls, many tough rules remain in Singapore. "Playboy" magazine is banned, while oral sex remains technically illegal under a law that says "whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animals" can be fined and jailed up to 10 years, or even for life.

In recent years, Singapore has partially relaxed its famous ban on chewing gum, allowed some bars to stay open for 24 hours and ended a ban on the popular U.S. sitcom "Sex and the City."
<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20050825/od_nm/singapore_porn_dc;_ylt=AhzKN85qt.145DJOFYK26dqs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3NW1oMDRpBHNlYwM3NTc-">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20050825/...RpBHNlYwM3NTc-</a>

I don't see how a ban on chewing gun should even be a government affair, let alone whatever movies this poor man (whose name and employer is now spread across the internet) wants to watch.

And what I really want to know is how does a government make a certain type of sex illegal? How do they actually find people guilty of this? Are they peeping in peoples windows or are there a lot of jealous ex-lovers spreading rumors?

This is crazy

What the? My impression of Singapore has been of this extremely modern country. And about sex... They're sex freaks. It's all freaky kinky sutff there.

Very weird. In Dubai they catch them in customs too. But they just confiscate it and tell you to bug off before they press charges (we all know what they'dbe doing with them). Althought its only when you bring them in bulk. It seems like you've got them for sale. Singapore should also have a major piracy issue.

Chewing gum (and similar chewables) are banned in several countries. Not in public spaces that is. Because people then spit it on the street. Singapore prides itself on cleanliness. In Dubai, the Indian/Pakistani favorite Pan is banned. It creates this reddish spit in your mouth which some people love spitting out. Ugly stains.

Just mentioning it since both cities have a lot of similarities.

Kinda, it comes in all kinds of flavors. I've only eaten the sweet kind. But Pan is a leaf, and whatever flavor you want, it can be wrapped in the leaf. I know this person who got questioned for bringing in Pan in the US! They must've thought, its some sort drug-related plant.

contrary to what you guys have spoken, singapore is a great place to live in! i have been living in singapore all my life (20 years). laws are sad to speak, still laws, and they are made to be implemented.

we ban chewing gums, yes. you guys moan and ***** about it being "boring", "sad" etc. but hey! our country is VERY clean. you barely see rubbish clogging the street, or accidentally sit on used chewing gums on the train. (imagine getting it on your hair after accidentally brushing against something!)

our laws are harsh. no doubt, but we ARE also one of the safest countries in the world to live in. our crime rates are superbly low. kidnapping is now such a rare occurence after capital punishment (hanging) for kidnapping crimes was implemented.

and yes, our customs do close one eye if only a few pieces of pornographic cd's are smuggled in. sometimes the cd's are confiscated and the person(s) involved are let off with a warning, if it is just a FEW cd's. otherwise, you'll be charged. the laws here are quite fair actually.

In Singapore buying and selling porn discs is banned but you can still access pay sites via internet. Prostitution is restricted to the Geylang District where all the prostitutes have to be registered with the gov and they are required to go for periodic health checks for STD. It is mandatory to use condoms, any erring customer will be bashed by the bouncers. Oral sex is classified under abnormal sexual acts and is usually determined by a confession from the offender. Recently a cop was fired and locked up for 6 months because he had oral sex with his GF. As for chewing gums, medicinal gums were recently unbanned. But inorder to buy them from pharmacies, you need a doctor's prescription and you need to be registered with the gov.
Singapore might sound boring but them some people might find the safe and secure environment very attractive.

Sex exhibition under close police watch Fri Nov 18,10:29 AM ET

Singapore opened its first sex exhibition on Friday with police saying they will also attend to make sure organizers and exhibitors comply with the city-state's strict laws.

Police and the Singapore's media watchdog have reminded event organizers of rules restricting the display of adult toys such as vibrators and warned them not to promote homosexuality.

"Organizers must not promote objectionable sexual behaviors or lifestyle, such as sado-masochism, bestiality, homosexuality, paedophilia and promiscuity," police spokesman Victor Keong said.

Titled Sexpo 2005, the three-day event will feature erotic dance competitions, an array of sex toys and sex-friendly furniture, as well as a series of seminars on sexual health.

Keong said police will visit the exhibition site to ensure that the rules are not breached.

Under Singapore laws, it is an offence to "sell, distribute, exhibit, import or export an obscene object." Those violating the law can be punished with a jail term of up to six months, or a fine, or both. The law does not define obscene objects.

Although a few sex shops have sprung up in Singapore in recent years, Sexpo Organizers said they would err on the side of caution and exhibitors have been given a set of guidelines on the exhibit of adult material.

Sexpo director Kenny Goh said the display of obscene items, such as oversized vibrators, an inflatable sex doll and penis rings, have been banned.

Goh said it took about two months to get police approval to stage the event. Access to Singapore's Expo center will be strictly monitored and only those aged 21 or above will be allowed entry.

The wealthy Southeast Asian city-state, which has consistently ranked at the bottom in a global survey of sexually active nations, is struggling to reverse its falling birth rate, one of the world's lowest.

In an attempt to shake off its staid image and woo tourists, the authorities are also gradually relaxing censorship laws that ban "Playboy" magazine and clip racy scenes from movies.

Interesting. For those that don't know Google bombing (or whacking apparently) is causing the Google engine to retrieve one particular site when searching for two words.

"miserable failure" used to get you George Bush's site in isolation.

However, just run a search and it now has (in order)
Dubya
Jimmy Carter
Michael Moore
Dick Gephardt (ironically a page on his site calling Dubya a miserable failure)
Hillary Clinton

as well as a few commentary pages.

I guess it is just hurling mud around in this context. Why else would anyone ever search for that phrase?

How this for a description?

<img src="http://www.strangecosmos.com/images/picturejokes/3904.jpg"/>

Found this revealing article on him also:
"Michael Moore: Class Clown"
Link:
<a href="http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=11470">http://frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=11470</a>

Excerpts:

"Those willing to call themselves "liberals" in these 2002 exit polls shrank to only 17 percent  roughly one voter in six  while conservatives increased to include more than one voter in three.

Moores self-deluded book has spent the past 10 weeks on the liberal New York Times Nonfiction Bestseller List (bumped down to #4 this week by fellow Lefty Al Frankens competing anti-American screed). But, truth be told, a Politically Correct author can climb this list with only a few thousand book sales in the right (that is, the Left) bookstores. The larger question with this, as with all of Michael Moores books and film "documentaries," is whether they should be listed as Nonfiction or as fiction.

Moore faces what Karl Marx called internal contradictions. If the nation were as Leftist as he claims, his book would be nothing more than a simpleton repetition of common beliefs......

But Moore knows that his fellow Americans elected Republicans to run the Senate, House and White House and are likely to do so again in 2004. The aim of his latest propaganda polemic is to rationalize and then reverse this, to achieve "regime change" in the United States.

Americans vote Republican, contrary to their own self-interest, writes Moore, because wealthy capitalist oil men have hypnotized them with an illegitimate war in Iraq, fear of terrorists, and a few crumbs from a tax cut (given mostly to the wealthy) that feeds the American Horatio Alger myth that we all can succeed.

"Horatio Alger Must Die," writes Moore. Americans should stop trying to become rich. Instead they should desert the War on Terror and enlist in the Class War. Our best chance for a halfway pleasant life, he argues, is to tax all wealth away from the rich and redistribute it to ourselves in the form of welfare, government healthcare and other benefits.

"You are never going to be rich" like Horatio Alger, writes Moore. "The chance of that happening is about one in a million." (This means that in our nation of 293 million people, we have only 293 millionaires.when in fact we have literally millions of citizens with a net worth in excess of a million dollars  and would have millions more if government greed and excessive taxation could be endedbut is it fair to apply logic to an utterly irrational hyper-Leftist ideologue like Moore?)

The problem with this pudgy messenger born 49 years ago into a working class family in Flint, Michigan, is that Michael Moore IS that one in a million who, in the jargon of Leftspeak, "won lifes lottery."......

But Michael Moore is very secretive about his own private life and how many dollars he makes. The amount of his income might be embarrassing to this foe of capitalism. Somebody might ask how this self-proclaimed champion of the proletariat justifies keeping, after taxes, millions and millions of dollars for himself instead of giving it all to the poor. Or some fellow socialist might ask why Moore takes this tax cut at all instead of telling the big government he loves so much to keep the money, government being so much better at spending our money than we are.

"Michael Moore would never withstand the scrutiny he lays on other people," says his former manager Douglas Urbanski. "You would think that hes the ultimate common man. But hes money-obsessed."...."

Yes sir...good ole' Michael Moore....continuing to make that 'buck' off the youth world-wide.....never giving a crap about nothing but spouting his same old rhetoric and agendas.......

"Americans should ditch the War On Terror and focus on the Class War. It's our best chance for a halfway pleasant life."

Had to re-read that. After reading about "ditching the way on terror". Which sounded a lot like Surrendering I might add.

It registered in my brain as "Our best chance for a healthy peasent life". I speak truth, thats how it appeared.

Speaking more truth: Fuck that!

I must admit to only have read a small amount of Moore's stuff. In fact I want to see "Roger and Me" purely because the jacket notes make me think of a man raging against GM making a commercial decision against Flint, the very same type of decision that caused GM to go to Flint in the first place!

But isn't Moore's principle "rant" that whilst it is acceptable under US culture to rage against Marxist ideologies and big government, it is seems to not be acceptable to rage against big corporate? After all the US gained independance from the unrepresentative lobbying of unaccountable "barons". Now, accordng to Moore, there is a danger that the unacountable corporate barons are removing democracy from the people?

His kind of nonsense might go over well in Europe but the American people are allot more conservative then the Europeans. This guy peaches a "hate America" leftism that is more suited to the French. The vast majority of Americans are against big government and see Marxist for what it is, crap.

That's nonsense. American is a democracy, and will continue to be one. Rich people have all ways had a say in politics, but the pols still do what the people want in the end because if they don't, they will have to find a new job.

Isn't Moore's point that the choice the US citizen's are getting are distorted in favour of the big corporate? I.e. One gets to choose A or B, but as the big corporates are lobbying both A an B it isn't much of a choice?

As i said i have only read a small amount of his stuff, but he strikes me as wanting more, not less, democracy.

All the President's Votes?
A Quiet Revolution is Taking Place in US Politics. By the Time It's Over, the Integrity of Elections Will be in the Unchallenged, Unscrutinized Control of a Few Large - and Pro-Republican - Corporations. Andrew Gumbel wonders if democracy in America can survive

by Andrew Gumbel

Something very odd happened in the mid-term elections in Georgia last November. On the eve of the vote, opinion polls showed Roy Barnes, the incumbent Democratic governor, leading by between nine and 11 points. In a somewhat closer, keenly watched Senate race, polls indicated that Max Cleland, the popular Democrat up for re-election, was ahead by two to five points against his Republican challenger, Saxby Chambliss.

Those figures were more or less what political experts would have expected in state with a long tradition of electing Democrats to statewide office. But then the results came in, and all of Georgia appeared to have been turned upside down. Barnes lost the governorship to the Republican, Sonny Perdue, 46 per cent to 51 per cent, a swing of as much as 16 percentage points from the last opinion polls. Cleland lost to Chambliss 46 per cent to 53, a last-minute swing of 9 to 12 points.

Red-faced opinion pollsters suddenly had a lot of explaining to do and launched internal investigations. Political analysts credited the upset - part of a pattern of Republican successes around the country - to a huge campaigning push by President Bush in the final days of the race. They also said that Roy Barnes had lost because of a surge of "angry white men" punishing him for eradicating all but a vestige of the old confederate symbol from the state flag.

But something about these explanations did not make sense, and they have made even less sense over time. When the Georgia secretary of state's office published its demographic breakdown of the election earlier this year, it turned out there was no surge of angry white men; in fact, the only subgroup showing even a modest increase in turnout was black women.

There were also big, puzzling swings in partisan loyalties in different parts of the state. In 58 counties, the vote was broadly in line with the primary election. In 27 counties in Republican-dominated north Georgia, however, Max Cleland unaccountably scored 14 percentage points higher than he had in the primaries. And in 74 counties in the Democrat south, Saxby Chambliss garnered a whopping 22 points more for the Republicans than the party as a whole had won less than three months earlier.

Now, weird things like this do occasionally occur in elections, and the figures, on their own, are not proof of anything except statistical anomalies worthy of further study. But in Georgia there was an extra reason to be suspicious. Last November, the state became the first in the country to conduct an election entirely with touchscreen voting machines, after lavishing $54m (£33m) on a new system that promised to deliver the securest, most up-to-date, most voter-friendly election in the history of the republic. The machines, however, turned out to be anything but reliable. With academic studies showing the Georgia touchscreens to be poorly programmed, full of security holes and prone to tampering, and with thousands of similar machines from different companies being introduced at high speed across the country, computer voting may, in fact, be US democracy's own 21st-century nightmare.

In many Georgia counties last November, the machines froze up, causing long delays as technicians tried to reboot them. In heavily Democratic Fulton County, in downtown Atlanta, 67 memory cards from the voting machines went missing, delaying certification of the results there for 10 days. In neighboring DeKalb County, 10 memory cards were unaccounted for; they were later recovered from terminals that had supposedly broken down and been taken out of service.

It is still unclear exactly how results from these missing cards were tabulated, or if they were counted at all. And we will probably never know, for a highly disturbing reason. The vote count was not conducted by state elections officials, but by the private company that sold Georgia the voting machines in the first place, under a strict trade-secrecy contract that made it not only difficult but actually illegal - on pain of stiff criminal penalties - for the state to touch the equipment or examine the proprietary software to ensure the machines worked properly. There was not even a paper trail to follow up. The machines were fitted with thermal printing devices that could theoretically provide a written record of voters' choices, but these were not activated. Consequently, recounts were impossible. Had Diebold Inc, the manufacturer, been asked to review the votes, all it could have done was program the computers to spit out the same data as before, flawed or not.

Astonishingly, these are the terms under which America's top three computer voting machine manufacturers - Diebold, Sequoia and Election Systems and Software (ES&amp;S) - have sold their products to election officials around the country. Far from questioning the need for rigid trade secrecy and the absence of a paper record, secretaries of state and their technical advisers - anxious to banish memories of the hanging chad fiasco and other associated disasters in the 2000 presidential recount in Florida - have, for the most part, welcomed the touchscreen voting machines as a technological miracle solution.

Georgia was not the only state last November to see big last-minute swings in voting patterns. There were others in Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois and New Hampshire - all in races that had been flagged as key partisan battlegrounds, and all won by the Republican Party. Again, this was widely attributed to the campaigning efforts of President Bush and the demoralization of a Democratic Party too timid to speak out against the looming war in Iraq.

Strangely, however, the pollsters made no comparable howlers in lower-key races whose outcome was not seriously contested. Another anomaly, perhaps. What, then, is one to make of the fact that the owners of the three major computer voting machines are all prominent Republican Party donors? Or of a recent political fund-raising letter written to Ohio Republicans by Walden O'Dell, Diebold's chief executive, in which he said he was "committed to helping Ohio to deliver its electoral votes to the president next year" - even as his company was bidding for the contract on the state's new voting machinery?

Alarmed and suspicious, a group of Georgia citizens began to look into last November's election to see whether there was any chance the results might have been deliberately or accidentally manipulated. Their research proved unexpectedly, and disturbingly, fruitful.

First, they wanted to know if the software had undergone adequate checking. Under state and federal law, all voting machinery and component parts must be certified before use in an election. So an Atlanta graphic designer called Denis Wright wrote to the secretary of state's office for a copy of the certification letter. Clifford Tatum, assistant director of legal affairs for the election division, wrote back: "We have determined that no records exist in the Secretary of State's office regarding a certification letter from the lab certifying the version of software used on Election Day." Mr Tatum said it was possible the relevant documents were with Gary Powell, an official at the Georgia Technology Authority, so campaigners wrote to him as well. Mr Powell responded he was "not sure what you mean by the words 'please provide written certification documents' ".

"If the machines were not certified, then right there the election was illegal," Mr Wright says. The secretary of state's office has yet to demonstrate anything to the contrary. The investigating citizens then considered the nature of the software itself. Shortly after the election, a Diebold technician called Rob Behler came forward and reported that, when the machines were about to be shipped to Georgia polling stations in the summer of 2002, they performed so erratically that their software had to be amended with a last-minute "patch". Instead of being transmitted via disk - a potentially time-consuming process, especially since its author was in Canada, not Georgia - the patch was posted, along with the entire election software package, on an open-access FTP, or file transfer protocol site, on the internet.

That, according to computer experts, was a violation of the most basic of security precautions, opening all sorts of possibilities for the introduction of rogue or malicious code. At the same time, however, it gave campaigners a golden opportunity to circumvent Diebold's own secrecy demands and see exactly how the system worked. Roxanne Jekot, a computer programmer with 20 years' experience, and an occasional teacher at Lanier Technical College northeast of Atlanta, did a line-by-line review and found "enough to stand your hair on end".

"There were security holes all over it," she says, "from the most basic display of the ballot on the screen all the way through the operating system." Although the program was designed to be run on the Windows 2000 NT operating system, which has numerous safeguards to keep out intruders, Ms Jekot found it worked just fine on the much less secure Windows 98; the 2000 NT security features were, as she put it, "nullified".

Also embedded in the software were the comments of the programmers working on it. One described what he and his colleagues had just done as "a gross hack". Elsewhere was the remark: "This doesn't really work." "Not a confidence builder, would you say?" Ms Jekot says. "They were operating in panic mode, cobbling together something that would work for the moment, knowing that at some point they would have to go back to figure out how to make it work more permanently." She found some of the code downright suspect - for example, an overtly meaningless instruction to divide the number of write-in votes by 1. "From a logical standpoint there is absolutely no reason to do that," she says. "It raises an immediate red flag."

Mostly, though, she was struck by the shoddiness of much of the programming. "I really expected to have some difficulty reviewing the source code because it would be at a higher level than I am accustomed to," she says. "In fact, a lot of this stuff looked like the homework my first-year students might have turned in." Diebold had no specific comment on Ms Jekot's interpretations, offering only a blanket caution about the complexity of election systems "often not well understood by individuals with little real-world experience".

But Ms Jekot was not the only one to examine the Diebold software and find it lacking. In July, a group of researchers from the Information Security Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore discovered what they called "stunning flaws". These included putting the password in the source code, a basic security no-no; manipulating the voter smart-card function so one person could cast more than one vote; and other loopholes that could theoretically allow voters' ballot choices to be altered without their knowledge, either on the spot or by remote access.

Diebold issued a detailed response, saying that the Johns Hopkins report was riddled with false assumptions, inadequate information and "a multitude of false conclusions". Substantially similar findings, however, were made in a follow-up study on behalf of the state of Maryland, in which a group of computer security experts catalogued 328 software flaws, 26 of them critical, putting the whole system "at high risk of compromise". "If these vulnerabilities are exploited, significant impact could occur on the accuracy, integrity, and availability of election results," their report says.

Ever since the Johns Hopkins study, Diebold has sought to explain away the open FTP file as an old, incomplete version of its election package. The claim cannot be independently verified, because of the trade-secrecy agreement, and not everyone is buying it. "It is documented throughout the code who changed what and when. We have the history of this program from 1996 to 2002," Ms Jekot says. "I have no doubt this is the software used in the elections." Diebold now says it has upgraded its encryption and password features - but only on its Maryland machines.

A key security question concerned compatibility with Microsoft Windows, and Ms Jekot says just three programmers, all of them senior Diebold executives, were involved in this aspect of the system. One of these, Diebold's vice-president of research and development, Talbot Iredale, wrote an e-mail in April 2002 - later obtained by the campaigners - making it clear that he wanted to shield the operating system from Wylie Labs, an independent testing agency involved in the early certification process.

The reason that emerges from the e-mail is that he wanted to make the software compatible with WinCE 3.0, an operating system used for handhelds and PDAs; in other words, a system that could be manipulated from a remote location. "We do not want Wyle [sic] reviewing and certifying the operating systems," the e-mail reads. "Therefore can we keep to a minimum the references to the WinCE 3.0 operating system."

In an earlier intercepted e-mail, this one from Ken Clark in Diebold's research and development department, the company explained upfront to another independent testing lab that the supposedly secure software system could be accessed without a password, and its contents easily changed using the Microsoft Access program Mr Clark says he had considered putting in a password requirement to stop dealers and customers doing "stupid things", but that the easy access had often "got people out of a bind". Astonishingly, the representative from the independent testing lab did not see anything wrong with this and granted certification to the part of the software program she was inspecting - a pattern of lackadaisical oversight that was replicated all the way to the top of the political chain of command in Georgia, and in many other parts of the country.

Diebold has not contested the authenticity of the e-mails, now openly accessible on the internet. However, Diebold did caution that, as the e-mails were taken from a Diebold Election systems website in March 2003 by an illegal hack, the nature of the information stolen could have been revised or manipulated.

There are two reasons why the United States is rushing to overhaul its voting systems. The first is the Florida débâcle in the Bush-Gore election; no state wants to be the center of that kind of attention again. And the second is the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), signed by President Bush last October, which promises an unprecedented $3.9bn (£2.3bn) to the states to replace their old punchcard-and-lever machines. However, enthusiasm for the new technology seems to be motivated as much by a bureaucratic love of spending as by a love of democratic accountability. According to Rebecca Mercuri, a research fellow at Harvard's John F Kennedy School of Government and a specialist in voting systems, the shockingly high error rate of punchcard machines (3-5 per cent in Florida in 2000) has been known to people in the elections business for years. It was only after it became public knowledge in the last presidential election that anybody felt moved to do anything about it.

The problem is, computer touchscreen machines and other so-called DRE (direct recording electronic) systems are significantly less reliable than punchcards, irrespective of their vulnerability to interference. In a series of research papers for the Voting Technology Project, a joint venture of the prestigious Massachusetts and California Institutes of Technology, DREs were found to be among the worst performing systems. No method, the MIT/CalTech study conceded, worked more reliably than hand-counting paper ballots - an option that US electoral officials seem to consider hopelessly antiquated, or at least impractical in elections combining multiple local, state and national races for offices from President down to dogcatcher.

The clear disadvantages and dangers associated with DREs have not deterred state and county authorities from throwing themselves headlong into touchscreen technology. More than 40,000 machines made by Diebold alone are already in use in 37 states, and most are touchscreens. County after county is poised to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more on computer voting before next spring's presidential primaries. "They say this is the direction they have to go in to have fair elections, but the rush to go towards computerization is very dubious," Dr Mercuri says. "One has to wonder why this is going on, because the way it is set up it takes away the checks and balances we have in a democratic society. That's the whole point of paper trails and recounts."

Anyone who has struggled with an interactive display in a museum knows how dodgy touchscreens can be. If they don't freeze, they easily become misaligned, which means they can record the wrong data. In Dallas, during early voting before last November's election, people found that no matter how often they tried to press a Democrat button, the Republican candidate's name would light up. After a court hearing, Diebold agreed to take down 18 machines with apparent misalignment problems. "And those were the ones where you could visually spot a problem," Dr Mercuri says. "What about what you don't see? Just because your vote shows up on the screen for the Democrats, how do you know it is registering inside the machine for the Democrats?"

Other problems have shown up periodically: machines that register zero votes, or machines that indicate voters coming to the polling station but not voting, even when a single race with just two candidates was on the ballot. Dr Mercuri was part of a lawsuit in Palm Beach County in which she and other plaintiffs tried to have a suspect Sequoia machine examined, only to run up against the brick wall of the trade-secret agreement. "It makes it really hard to show their product has been tampered with," she says, "if it's a felony to inspect it."

As for the possibilities of foul play, Dr Mercuri says they are virtually limitless. "There are literally hundreds of ways to do this," she says. "There are hundreds of ways to embed a rogue series of commands into the code and nobody would ever know because the nature of programming is so complex. The numbers would all tally perfectly." Tampering with an election could be something as simple as a "denial-of-service" attack, in which the machines simply stop working for an extended period, deterring voters faced with the prospect of long lines. Or it could be done with invasive computer codes known in the trade by such nicknames as "Trojan horses" or "Easter eggs". Detecting one of these, Dr Mercuri says, would be almost impossible unless the investigator knew in advance it was there and how to trigger it. Computer researcher Theresa Hommel, who is alarmed by touchscreen systems, has constructed a simulated voting machine in which the same candidate always wins, no matter what data you put in. She calls her model the Fraud-o-matic, and it is available online at <a href="http://www.wheresthepaper.org.">www.wheresthepaper.org.</a>

It is not just touchscreens which are at risk from error or malicious intrusion. Any computer system used to tabulate votes is vulnerable. An optical scan of ballots in Scurry County, Texas, last November erroneously declared a landslide victory for the Republican candidate for county commissioner; a subsequent hand recount showed that the Democrat had in fact won. In Comal County, Texas, a computerized optical scan found that three different candidates had won their races with exactly 18,181 votes. There was no recount or investigation, even though the coincidence, with those recurring 1s and 8s, looked highly suspicious. In heavily Democrat Broward County, Florida - which had switched to touchscreens in the wake of the hanging chad furore - more than 100,000 votes were found to have gone "missing" on election day. The votes were reinstated, but the glitch was not adequately explained. One local official blamed it on a "minor software thing".

Most suspect of all was the governor's race in Alabama, where the incumbent Democrat, Don Siegelman, was initially declared the winner. Sometime after midnight, when polling station observers and most staff had gone home, the probate judge responsible for elections in rural Baldwin County suddenly "discovered" that Mr Siegelman had been awarded 7,000 votes too many. In a tight election, the change was enough to hand victory to his Republican challenger, Bob Riley. County officials talked vaguely of a computer tabulation error, or a lightning strike messing up the machines, but the real reason was never ascertained because the state's Republican attorney general refused to authorize a recount or any independent ballot inspection.

According to an analysis by James Gundlach, a sociology professor at Auburn University in Alabama, the result in Baldwin County was full of wild deviations from the statistical norms established both by this and preceding elections. And he adds: "There is simply no way that electronic vote counting can produce two sets of results without someone using computer programs in ways that were not intended. In other words, the fact that two sets of results were reported is sufficient evidence in and of itself that the vote tabulation process was compromised." Although talk of voting fraud quickly subsided, Alabama has now amended its election laws to make recounts mandatory in close races.

The possibility of flaws in the electoral process is not something that gets discussed much in the United States. The attitude seems to be: we are the greatest democracy in the world, so the system must be fair. That has certainly been the prevailing view in Georgia, where even leading Democrats - their prestige on the line for introducing touchscreen voting in the first place - have fought tooth-and-nail to defend the integrity of the system. In a phone interview, the head of the Georgia Technology Authority who brought Diebold machines to the state, Larry Singer, blamed the growing chorus of criticism on "fear of technology", despite the fact that many prominent critics are themselves computer scientists. He says: "Are these machines flawless? No. Would you have more confidence if they were completely flawless? Yes. Is there such a thing as a flawless system? No." Mr Singer, who left the GTA straight after the election and took a 50 per cent pay cut to work for Sun Microsystems, insists that voters are more likely to have their credit card information stolen by a busboy in a restaurant than to have their vote compromised by touchscreen technology.

Voting machines are sold in the United States in much the same way as other government contracts: through intensive lobbying, wining and dining. At a recent national conference of clerks, election officials and treasurers in Denver, attendees were treated to black-tie dinners and other perks, including free expensive briefcases stamped with Sequoia's company logo alongside the association's own symbol. Nobody in power seems to find this worrying, any more than they worried when Sequoia's southern regional sales manager, Phil Foster, was indicted in Louisiana a couple of years ago for "conspiracy to commit money laundering and malfeasance". The charges were dropped in exchange for his testimony against Louisiana's state commissioner of elections. Similarly, last year, the Arkansas secretary of state, Bill McCuen, pleaded guilty to taking bribes and kickbacks involving a precursor company to ES&amp;S; the voting machine company executive who testified against him in exchange for immunity is now an ES&amp;S vice-president.

If much of the worry about vote-tampering is directed at the Republicans, it is largely because the big three touchscreen companies are all big Republican donors, pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into party coffers in the past few years. The ownership issue is, of course, compounded by the lack of transparency. Or, as Dr Mercuri puts it: "If the machines were independently verifiable, who would give a crap who owns them?" As it is, fears that US democracy is being hijacked by corporate interests are being fueled by links between the big three and broader business interests, as well as extremist organizations. Two of the early backers of American Information Systems, a company later merged into ES&amp;S, are also prominent supporters of the Chalcedon Foundation, an organization that espouses theocratic governance according to a literal reading of the Bible and advocates capital punishment for blasphemy and homosexuality.

The chief executive of American Information Systems in the early Nineties was Chuck Hagel, who went on to run for elective office and became the first Republican in 24 years to be elected to the Senate from Nebraska, cheered on by the Omaha World-Herald newspaper which also happens to be a big investor in ES&amp;S. In yet another clamorous conflict of interest, 80 per cent of Mr Hagel's winning votes - both in 1996 and again in 2002 - were counted, under the usual terms of confidentiality, by his own company.

In theory, the federal government should be monitoring the transition to computer technology and rooting out abuses. Under the Help America Vote Act, the Bush administration is supposed to establish a sizeable oversight committee, headed by two Democrats and two Republicans, as well as a technical panel to determine standards for new voting machinery. The four commission heads were supposed to have been in place by last February, but so far just one has been appointed. The technical panel also remains unconstituted, even though the new machines it is supposed to vet are already being sold in large quantities - a state of affairs Dr Mercuri denounces as "an abomination".

One of the conditions states have to fulfil to receive federal funding for the new voting machines, meanwhile, is a consolidation of voter rolls at state rather than county level. This provision sends a chill down the spine of anyone who has studied how Florida consolidated its own voter rolls just before the 2000 election, purging the names of tens of thousands of eligible voters, most of them African Americans and most of them Democrats, through misuse of an erroneous list of convicted felons commissioned by Katherine Harris, the secretary of state doubling as George Bush's Florida campaign manager. Despite a volley of lawsuits, the incorrect list was still in operation in last November's mid-terms, raising all sorts of questions about what other states might now do with their own voter rolls. It is not that the Act's consolidation provision is in itself evidence of a conspiracy to throw elections, but it does leave open that possibility.

Meanwhile, the administration has been pushing new voting technology of its own to help overseas citizens and military personnel, both natural Republican Party constituencies, to vote more easily over the internet. Internet voting is notoriously insecure and open to abuse by just about anyone with rudimentary hacking skills; just last January, an experiment in internet voting in Toronto was scuppered by a Slammer worm attack. Undeterred, the administration has gone ahead with its so-called SERVE project for overseas voting, via a private consortium made up of major defense contractors and a Saudi investment group. The contract for overseeing internet voting in the 2004 presidential election was recently awarded to Accenture, formerly part of the Arthur Andersen group (whose accountancy branch, a major campaign contributor to President Bush, imploded as a result of the Enron bankruptcy scandal).

Not everyone in the United States has fallen under the spell of the big computer voting companies, and there are signs of growing wariness. Oregon decided even before HAVA to conduct all its voting by mail. Wisconsin has decided it wants nothing to do with touchscreen machines without a verifiable paper trail, and New York is considering a similar injunction, at least for its state assembly races. In California, a Stanford computer science professor called David Dill is screaming from the rooftops on the need for a paper trail in his state, so far without result. And a New Jersey Congressman called Rush Holt has introduced a bill in the House of Representatives, the Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act, asking for much the same thing. Not everyone is heeding the warnings, though. In Ohio, publication of the letter from Diebold's chief executive promising to deliver the state to President Bush in 2004 has not deterred the secretary of state - a Republican - from putting Diebold on a list of preferred voting-machine vendors. Similarly, in Maryland, officials have not taken the recent state-sponsored study identifying hundreds of flaws in the Diebold software as any reason to change their plans to use Diebold machines in March's presidential primary.

The question is whether the country will come to its senses before elections start getting distorted or tampered with on such a scale that the system becomes unmanageable. The sheer volume of money offered under HAVA is unlikely to be forthcoming again in a hurry, so if things aren't done right now it is doubtful the system can be fixed again for a long time. "This is frightening, really frightening," says Dr Mercuri, and a growing number of reasonable people are starting to agree with her. One such is John Zogby, arguably the most reliable pollster in the United States, who has freely admitted he "blew" last November's elections and does not exclude the possibility that foul play was one of the factors knocking his calculations off course. "We're plowing into a brave new world here," he says, "where there are so many variables aside from out-and-out corruption that can change elections, especially in situations where the races are close. We have machines that break down, or are tampered with, or are simply misunderstood. It's a cause for great concern."

Roxanne Jekot, who has put much of her professional and personal life on hold to work on the issue full time, puts it even more strongly. "Corporate America is very close to running this country. The only thing that is stopping them from taking total control are the pesky voters. That's why there's such a drive to control the vote. What we're seeing is the corporatization of the last shred of democracy.

"I feel that unless we stop it here and stop it now," she says, "my kids won't grow up to have a right to vote at all."

Corporations can lobbies the pols all they want, but a pols is going to, in the end, do what the people want because they voted them into office. The pols might drop these corporations a bone every once in a while, but what they are giving them is money or tax breaks. They are not changing their core policies because of the lobbyists. Those who think that the Iraq war, for example, was some corporate conspiracy over estimate the power of corporations.

Who had a more liberal constitution the US or the USSR? Who had the one protecting the more freedoms? Answer: the USSR. The point is that it is not the words that Moore says. Its the consequence of his policies. Marxism has killing millions of people. It gave birth to Stalinism which allied itself with fascism. Marxism is proven by history to fail again and again, yet people like Moore continue to try to spread it. The American people understand that. He get little traction here.

This statement is misleading, and borders on being an out right lie. Georgia is a Republican state and has been so for many years, since the '60. It is amazing how the Dems managed to hold on the the governorship and the senate seats so long. The Southern US is VERY conservative. Even when they elect dems, they and conservatives dems not the Moores of the world. If fact I believe Georgia's other senator is the dem the supports President Bush in the next election.

</quote>

This election was held in 2002, a mere 1 year after 9/11. People in Europe don't get what 9/11 did to America. Bush approval rating a month after September 11 was 90%. I believe it was in the 60's if not 70's at the time of the election. Most American were enraged by 9/11 and wanted to enable the President to do what he wanted to do in the War on Terrorism. A poll of base indicators came out right before the election show the republicans would win big. The media of course down played it. In the end the key issue in Georgia wasn't turn out or the confederate flag, it was the vote on the department of homeland security. The Dems voted against it because the department wasn't going to recognize some unions and that killed them in the south.

Georgia also fits the pattern across the country. The Republicans won the majority of seats in the state legislators for the first time in 80 years. The Republicans controlled the majority of governorships, and gained 3 senate seats and 7, or there about, house seats. The Dems just got killed. Its as simple as that. They took policy counter to those of a popular president and the paid for it. The was no grand conspiracy.

I thought this quote was pretty telling about what Moore stands for:

<quote>
"Many families have been devastated tonight. This just is not right. They did not deserve to die. If someone did this to get back at Bush, then they did so by killing thousands of people who DID NOT VOTE for him! Boston, New York, DC, and the planes' destination of California--these were places that voted AGAINST Bush!" --Michael Moore, Michaelmoore.com, September 12

His sentiment in that quote seems to be that if Al-qaeda had managed to build a "Repulican Bomb" that leaves others unharmed it would have been OK.

But perhaps he was simply saying how random the attack was, that it killed people who had no way of influencing US policy, or indeed had tried to influence US policy by voting for someone else?

I don't think so. He was stating that it is only wrong to kill people that didn't vote for Bush. There is more to that statement in which he wonders why the terrorists didnt attack Texas, which is Bushs home state.

"(T)he passengers were scaredy-cats because they were mostly white. If the passengers had included black men those killers, with their puny bodies and unimpressive small knives, would have been crushed by the dudes." -- Michael Moore on Flight 93

I thought this was equality disgraceful and racist.

Note: Fight 93 was the flight on which passengers bravely stormed the hijackers which prevented them from taking out hundreds if not thousands of people on the ground.

It is mentioned a few times in "Bowling For Columbine", along with photos of him winning some shooting awards or something, it is part of his "these are my people" bit in Michigan.

Here is MM's explanation :-

MM: "I was a junior member when I was in the boy scouts when I was a kid, but I became a lifetime member after the Columbine massacre because my first thought after Columbine was to run against Charlton Heston for the presidency of the NRA. You have to be a lifetime member to be able to do that, so I had to pay $750 (about £450) to join. My plan was to get 5m Americans to join for the lowest basic membership and vote for me so that I'd win and dismantle the organisation. Unfortunately, I figured that's just too much work for me so instead I made this movie. But I'm still a lifetime member, until they excommunicate me... which is not far off, from what I hear."

That quote is from a fairly long <a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,841083,00.html">interview in The Guardian</a> a couple of years ago.

Show me the evidence that the boy scouts shouldn't be turning out "screwed up" people. Seems to me it's an outdated form of extended camp, which manages to be both extremely homophobic and strangely homoerotic at the same time.

I think that if you took a literal definition of documentary, Moore's works wouldn't classify. I think the problem is that it does classify when you look at his style's peers. Therefore, perhaps the whoe category needs to be re-classified. But some notable houses are going to have their catalogue labelled fiction.

Anyway the one thing I agreed with him and which btw is true for all countries is that the only poor or under-priveliged ppl tend to join the services and his assertion that once these "lower caste" ppl do put their pathetic lives on the line to go and kill some 2 cent A-raanb to "defend" our Go-damn lives, then we should at least have the wisdom and concience to not send them in harms way unless it directly threatens our way of life or our country.

you can't argue or reason with that notion of his because no matter which way you look at it, the iraq war was a total agenda.

Contained threats still need to be delt with, and yes Saddam WAS a threat. He did absolutely nothing to end terrorism and let them run around freely in his country. His own henchmen were terrorists loping off hands heads and anything else the saw fit as punishment for fantom crimes. He continueously called for the "distruction" of Israel and ploted to assassinate a former president.

As long as saddam was runnign Iraq, terrorism would have its propoganda machine intact.

The real reason is because the Chinese would like the North Koreans to remain peacefull, their just as concerned about nukes in thir backyard as the U.S. is.

You seem to leave quite a few point's out there Lull, Israel is not an elligal entity, its recognized as a nation by the U.N., yes your beloved U.N. Ifthe U.S. is so uncaring about the people in the korean penninsula why don't they just nuke Korea? They don't have missles that can reach the U.S., so with your logic theres nothing to lose right?

"Kinda like a smoking father tellin his retarded son to quit smokin.... First the U.S. and Russia should stand on a neutral/ moral or better yet a non hypocritical platform before preachin bullshit about WMD's."

Father knows best, he knows just what kind of hell smoking has put him through, fighting lung cancer so its a good thing that he tells his kid to quit now and save himself.

"In all honesty I don't think North Korea threatens anyone, as long as they are left alone to do their thing."

You definately don't have a clue do you Lull, ever listen to ol Kim?

"They wont invade the South unless provoked."

They don't invade because they know they will be wiped off the face of the earth.

"Like wise Pakistan, india, israel or Iran don't threaten anyone either. It is ludicrous for the successive Administrations to assume that everyone else is a neanderthal!"

The left seem to think its not ludacrous to call Bush a neanderthal, my how hypocritical!

Pakistan dosn't invade because they have India to deal with, if they play their cards wrong the U.S. supports India and its game over....

India dosn't attack for the same reason as Pakistan, China might join Pakistan.

Israel doesn't invade because they are a civilized nation

Iran dosn't invade because they know they would give us the excuse we need to remove the mulahs from power and establish a free society in Iran, by not attacking they bide time to fight their little poxy wars in Iraq and Afganistan.

That, in my opinion, makes him a successful con man.

He is the Jeraldo Rivera of documentaries. As for "his message"...he gets "a" message out, but I don't really believe it is his message. He loves the spotlight, and seems to grab onto, like any opportunist, whatever he thinks will draw people's attention.

I'm for offing him, too, but only if it never makes the news.

I think Howards record with regard to the treatment of asylum seekers speaks for itself, he is a racist pig who was only re-elected in 2001 due to a skillful appeal to racist prejudice.

As for courage, I suppose its courage to drag you country to war and send your nations young boys to kill some other nations young boys, in defiance of the wishes of 75% of the population and without the customry aproval of parliament.

Saddam may not have hunted them to extinction like we want to but he wasnt particullarly fond of them (Al Qaeda). He kept them under foot while in power because they were a threat to his power. They would have wanted to take over so to stop them he needed to keep them well trodden on (not trying to justify Saddam just saying he didnt get on to well with uncle Osama).

Besides, Saddam did'nt have much to do with Al Qaida. He had no link with them, so where should he have gone hunting for Osama/Al Qaida? Lets not forget the underlying economic reasons for this war! Oil and the monopoly over it. (I wish we had a govt that would take bolder decisions).

It is the Syrian/Pakistanis and Iran (to some extent), that have more to do terror organisations. Saudis are just financers.

Saddam does'nt resemble Stalin, the difference is in the mushtash, and face too.

Personally i like Moore. He may use dubious research, with biased interpretation and presentation of information but hey he isn't alone, as we have recently seen.

What i would like to see is people being held accountable for their failings. If as people insist Moore is flawed then i guess he will be held accountable due to the court of the box office. People will get bored. He will have a flop movie and disappear.

However i haven't seen the government agencies held accountable - has the axe been weilded yet within the halls of intelligence? All of us pay for these people to be wrong, only those that watch Moore's stuff pay for it.

I am not sure i agree with your views on medals, and service. People earn their medals, yes there may be some more deserving than others, but at the end of the day those service men and women are doing stuff we civvies don't even want to think about.

Active service used to be described as long periods of utter boredom, punctuated by short periods of absolute horror. Since the application of the helicopter the periods of boredom have got shorter. As far as i am concerned anyone who enters a combat theatre deserves our respect and support. Its our job as civvies to make sure that they only enter the correct theatre.

However i'd like to see the stats on the breakdown of the western (non-conscript) militaries. I would be pre-desposed to agree that the troops predominantly come from poorer areas, or areas that may not be poor, but whose only real employment is the military. A bit like a lottery is often percevied as a tax on the poor, the military is often an escape for the poor. But, perhaps if someone has the stats my pre-conception can be disproved.

I disagree that conscription only drafts the poor. Mohammed Ali would be a prime example of a very wealthy person conscripted. Bush and Kerry would be others. But it is one of those facts of life, the wealthy have more tools to work the system, just like tax. Poor people pay "more" tax because they can't afford to pay someone to make them tax efficient.

to add to this, poorer military personel are also over whelmingly more likely to end up in the back of the line, in support rolls, like mechanics, rather than in the infantry, or other positions in the front line. so its not like thier being used for cannon foder, they are actualy much less likely to be killed. poorer military personel are usualy looking for skills to use outside of the military, rather than the extra income some college student enrolled for, or as a career.

Should Canada join the US?
</headline>
<post author="DualCPU" datetime="2003-09-12T09:00:00" id="p1">
I heard about this board from the board at <a href="http://www.unitednorthamerica.org/phpBB2/index.php">http://www.unitednorthamerica.org/phpBB2/index.php</a> on <a href="http://www.unitednorthamerica.org/">http://www.unitednorthamerica.org/</a>. What that website is proposing is that Canada join the US. What does everyone here think of this. There are some pros and cons at <a href="http://www.unitednorthamerica.org/procon.htm">http://www.unitednorthamerica.org/procon.htm</a>. What I think most people would find here would find the most interesting is the uniform continental defense perimiter which would allow for both American and Canadian border guards stationed on the common border to be stationed elsewhere (Mexican border, airports, and ports).

Personally, I am for it. My only concern is that it could lead to Democrat control of the federal government, but I suspect that may not be a problem. It seems like the Republicans would be able to integrate Canadian conservatives more easily than the democrats could integrate Canadian liberals.

I'm curious where that 19.9% is. For instance, I suspect there is a high concentration in Alberta. When Alberta leaves, the situation is different making the rest of the provinces think differently. It would be a domino effect. All you need is for one or two provinces to leave and Canada will soon be dead.

Don't worry, we wouldn't get their firearms laws. The most likely path for Canada joining the US involves each province joining seperately leading the the government in Ottawa being dissolved and all of its nonsense laws about firearms (and many other things) dead.

Actually, they would die. Most likely each province joins seperately leading to the death of the government in Ottawa which would kill their nonsense socialist programs. In theory the new states could keep them, but they would be overwhelmed so that will never happen.

Ok, since you asked for the details. You barely escape the lazy clause.

OAF - aka the Kosovo War.

8 CF-18s (5% of the air effort doing 10% of the sorties)
2 Battle Groups attached to the British 4th Armoured Brigade
- Lord Strathcona Horse (Royal Canadians)
- 3rd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment

In all the ops I've mentioned, the Canadians are the 3rd or 4th largest force contributor ahead of much larger Italian and German forces.

Speaking of Canada in WWII, let's not forget the Canadian force at Dieppe. It was that disastrous British-Canadian raid that gained a wealth of knowledge for the D-Day landings at Normandy. In my humble opinion, it can be argued that the men who died in the Dieppe raid made a successful D-Day landing possible.
I am also rather tired of the Canadians being forgotten. Anybody know who jointly runs NORAD? Yeah, the USA and....Canada! Who is traditionally 2nd in command at NORAD? A Canadian! What was the first foreign country I ever visited? Canada!
Seriously though, I don't think people realize how much Canada did and does for the continental defense and overseas military operations.
Sure, Canada might have some policies or problems that Americans might not like. Well guess what? Canada ain't America!

Tophatter,

Hell, even Canadians don't know our warrior heritage. Canada was the 3rd most powerful country on earth at the end of WWII with the 3rd largest land army, 2nd or 3rd largest navy (depending if you count tonnage or ships), and the 4th largest AF, add to a vibrant industry that was undamaged by war and of course, cash up the ying-yang (everybody outside of North America owes Canada money for war supplies).

However, I wished I could say that the people in the know don't forget. Canada has a reputation of punching far above its weight, deploying forces in numbers that larger militaries (aka the Turks, Italians, Germans) would not deploy.

Every ship in Maritime Command (aka the Canadian Navy) has been deployed at least once, if not twice, in the past two years.

Just a side note, on 11 Sept, Canadian and American fighters patrol the entire North American airspace under NORAD auspicies with no respect to borders. It was unpractical for planes to turn back at the border when they still had effective rnage. NATO planes training in Labrador also took to the skies to man their positions with all weapons hot. In theory, non-American planes could have shot down American airliners though that would be through the orders of the POTUS.

The Americans asked for and got a Canadian battle group (3 PPCLI) in Afghanistan.

Canada is not allowed to say no to any deployment request. At best, we're offerred a choice but we're going.

When the Macedonian shit hit the fan, Canada offerred 4 observers. NATO demanded and got an entire coy. Rumsfeld offerred a choice to Canada. Take command of the ISAF or committ a bde to OIF. The coward Chretien chosed the former.

I said that Chretien is a coward not so much as saying no to OIF. He was respecting the majority wishes of the Canadian public. He was a coward for committing an entire bde without knowing just how dangerous and how ill prepared we are for that mission. He should have just say no and leave it at that.

I don't know about Dieppe's effects on D-Day though. If you look at the prep work of the various beaches, the Canadians by far got the most paperwork and had more rehersals than anybody else. The Americans got the least amount of prepwork relatively speaking (still a hell of alot in overall amount). The Americans also got alot of experience from the USMC actions in the Pacific though how much actually is transferred is debatable but suffice to say, the Americans knew how to land.

The only thing that was confirmed by D-Day is that a prepared opposed landing is not going to work.

Colonel
Good post and some especially good history.
I think most Canadians don't know of your warrior heritage and history simply because Canada has never been known as a "warlike" country like Great Britain,France,Germany, and the USA. Nothing at all wrong with that, in fact that's probably why Canadians can travel to just about anywhere and not have people heaving insults at them. "Yankee Go Home" ring a bell here guys?
One of the things that warmed my heart after September 11 was the glowing reports of Canadians throwing open their homes (and their arms) wide open to stranded Americans. Many Canadians that I chatted with online said, referring to the attacks, that WE have been attacked. There was no "The Americans were attacked". We were all in it together and at a time when the country (hell, the whole world) was reeling from the shock, it was comforting to know that our neighbor to the north was right there in with us. I was especially glad to read your details on the NORAD patrols. It jibed with everything else I've read and heard.
As far as Dieppe, I'll have to do some reading on that. It's been quite some years since I read about it, but I seem to recall it mentioning how much of an eye-opener it was and how some good lessons were learned. I'll see what I can find and post it on the History forum.

M21,

It's a trait of the government no matter which party is in power. The four guys we lost in Afghanistan is the first time I remembered when any elected official (Municipal, Provincial, or Federal) ever showed up at a military funeral or wake. The person who impressed me most there, however, was US CAS Gen Shinseki who said nothing but was just there to show his respects. Damn classy act.

Minor correction, the snipers were from 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia Canadian Light Infantry of the 1st Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group. The PPCLI is officially a regiment with three battalions but Regt HQ is only ceremonial.

There was some confusion about the Bronze Star being awarded to the snipers. There was no official requests from the US DoD to award the guys - a must under the Queen's Rules. I don't know the status of what happenned right now but there was the impression that Foreign Affairs told State not to make the request. Apparently, we're uncomfortable having war heros.

DND did honour the guys with our own medals but it would be nice to have the bronze stars recorded in the regt history.

Realistically, it doesn't seem possible that any part of Canada would join the U.S. It probably isn't a good idea anyway. It would take decades to work out the details.

I agree, this is more of an academic discussion more than anything. Canada remains a different country in so many ways, however much America has in common with her. I think Americans take for granted how fortunate we are to have a country such as Canada sharing such a huge common border. Perhaps the only other country in the world that could be compared to Canada in that fashion would be Great Britain.

It is an academic discussion to a point. However, all you need is one province to leave, and it goes beyond academic. Years ago it was thought that Quebec would secede (which would lead to this), but that has died down.

Now, the most likely candidate is Alberta. Alberta is quite possibly the most American province (as well as being the most free province) in Canada. The largest concentration of people who would wish to leave Canada is in Alberta now. Many of them would wish to join the US. Alberta would be quickly welcomed into the US. Republicans would gain extra votes that would solidify their majority. Alberta's oil reserves are very valuable.

I don't wish to hijack.

I also am not concerned with gun control.

All I wanted to know why in the US and Canada [since this is a phenomenon that we here cannot quite fathom but would sure want to know why] is there is always an equation between over the counter purchase of weapon and 'freedom'.

Bernard Shaw while walking down London Bridge objected to a man swinging his umbrella which hit him on the nose. The guy who hit him said, 'Sir, this is a free country and I can do what I want'.

GB Shaw retorted, 'Sir, your freedom ends where my nose begins!'.

Thus, what is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander and yet there is such a song and a dance about weapons being freely available being freedom or the freedom to go on a shikar and deplete wild life or even kill a man out of pique as what has been done in US schools at times.

Benajmin Spock is indeed wrong!

I challenge that assertion that Alberta wants to secede to the US. If anything, it is one of the strongest Canadian voices in Canada. It is the home of the 1st Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group and the strongest militia regiment representations in Canada. That history and tradition is too strong to even assert that pro-US sentiments would get a large foothold.

It's called the Balance of Transfer Payments.

For Federally funded programs such as health care, welfare, unemployment insurance, national pension, the idea here is that every Canadian no matter where he is would get the same service whether he's on the Pacific end or the Atlantic end.

Ontario and Alberta generates alot more tax revenue than they use which is then given to Provinces with smaller tax base to afford their programs.

Alberta got nothing to complain about here. Historically, they've got alot more out of the program than they put in. It's only when OPEC jacked up their oil prices is when Alberta started making the money.

And before the IT bubble burst, British Columbia also contributed positively to the program.

Ontario is the only province that has never benefitted from the program.

I would like to point out that the majority of the decent in the West is anti-Ontario and/or anti-Ottawa but rarely, if ever, anti-Canada.

Wouldnt French Canada (Quebec) be the most probable to want to to join the USA.

They are seperationists. And Quebec as an independent nation is just not probable. Most likely they would then become part of the USA.

Though, Canada's population has been steadily declining, thus I don't think it will be necessary to join the USA now.

And not to mention the history between the colonies and Canada and the USA and Canada has not been the most friendly. In more recent years with events such as wars Canada and the USA work together.

And the trade between the countries.

Why would any of the other provinces want to join the USA. My impression is that Quebec is the most likely to secede from the Canadian Confederacy. Being that it is the most independent province legally. That dates back to when England gained control of upper Canada and the King made an agreement with Quebec that they shall be generally left alone and the King will not try to enforce laws that are un-wanted, as King learned not to do earlier in the New World. I think that was with the Acadians.

French Canada, has had a history of wanting to be independent of the rest of the Canadian confederacy for quite sometime now.

The fact is the failure of US invasion into Canada had to do with stupid leadership and an unprepared military which consisted of something around 10,500 regulars. The rest were not very well trained militiamen who had no legal obligation to fight outside the United States.

The first invasion attempt wasn't even a fight. If I remeber correctly Hull almost got executed for his incompotence. The second one was a fairly even match(something like 1500 Soldiers from US and 1300, half of which were British and Native American). The third one Canadians and British were outnumbered something like 20:1 and we had our ass handed to us, lol.

The British Empire and Canada gained nothing from the war however, America took British Influence out of the US and they stoped "impressing" our ships. The Battle of New Orleans although it did not officially occur during the war allowed us to expand towards the west. Oh and need I remind you, the war was started by the British Empire.

Actually I only counted the war of 1812 as one event. The Battle of Queenston Heights is as professional as they came. The American salute to the fall of General Issac Brock is a tale of romanticism at its finest. Do you know of any other time an American Army gave salute to an Honoured Fallen Enemy?

The Battle of New Orleans was well matched.

The three attempts I counted were

1) The American Revolutionary War - Benedict Arnold's Invasion of Quebec

2) The War of 1812

3) The Fenian Invasions.

As far as the War of 1812 is concerned, the real winner was Canada, not the British Empire nor the US. Canada, as a people, was borned in that war. French Canadian Regiments were responsible for repelling the 1st two invasion attempts. In other words, French Canadians defended Canada.

A good portion of the defending forces in Canada weren't even Canadian.

Well, it ceased during the War. Napolean was beaten and hence no more need to restrict trade. However, the cause of that war is not as simple as that as you yourself has alluded to. The Northern States wanted to end the war to resume trade.

I have to count that one to be consistent in including Teddy Rosevelt's participation in the Spanish-American War - ie Private Regiments (as opposed to individual mercenaries) carrying war to foreign soil.

The Fenians did in fact flew their Civil War Regimental Colours when they clobbered the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada. Under the Rules of War at that time, that was an American invasion force.

I am well aware of the fact that the South wanted to expand territory and bring more states into the Union with Southern Settelers to get more votes in congress.

You got me on the trade but throwing the British out of New Orleans allowed us to expand out west and become as powerful as we are today.

You're misunderstanding my point. My point is that people rose up to defend their HOMES to those they perceived as a foreign invader. In other words, a sense of national identity was borned out of that war.

Yes and I understand this.

The Fenians did in fact flew their Civil War Regimental Colours when they clobbered the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada. Under the Rules of War at that time, that was an American invasion force.

They left because the US Government took their supplies not because Canada repelled them so how exactly this comes under the classification of "kicking our butts out of Canada".

I would pegged American power expansion as the result of the American Civil War. The technological and industrial might puts anything pre-Civil War to shame.

That's one half of it. The other half was that a superior force was being assembled and the Fenian position was no longer attainable. The Fenian Regiments were chased out.

Praxus,

I think you have a misunderstanding on how Canada view herself pre-WWII. Canada was not a country but a Dominion of the British Empire, a Bastion of the British Empire. Canada saw Herself as an equal voice within the Empire but very much part of the Empire.

Very much like your States pre-Civil War days. Thus, it is not quite fitting to seperate Canada and the British Empire as if they were two different entities. They were not.

Also, could you tell me what holdings the British had in New Orleans/Louisanna? I was not aware of any pre-1812 and the Paris Treaty stated a return to all pre-war borders.

Yah your right, but my point was that if they won the Battle of New Orleans they would have controled the Mouth of the Mississippi. and could have gained conessions from the United States.

However if they did win they still might have pulled out once they knew Treaty of Ghent was signed

I was incorrect in saying that it allowed us to expand westward.

On that, the decision has been made. It's either Fortress America or Fortress North America. Guess which one Canada wants?

The simple fact is, much to AnvilAnthony's ignorance, that neither Canada nor the US can survive without each other. The trade between the two nations (they're each other's largest trading partner - Mexico doesn't even come close) and dominant players in the G7 (Mexico doesn't even rank), there's got to be free movement through the borders.

I've had to knock both times I've been to Canada, so my "compromise" was really to leave things as they are.

We want "fortress America", Canada has to decide what it wants on it's own. The US government will then set it's policy accordingly. It's a bitch but our countries don't allways agree, and sometimes we'll both suffer for it. I doubt our border would ever be closed for any real length of time anyway.

Rediculus statement alert!

Exports with Canada only account for about 1.5% of our GDP.

The US unlike most of the world does not depend on exports for our economy to grow as exports with to the rest of the world only count for 6% of GDP.

This being said we don't need to close the border and all barriers to free trade against all countries should be torn down exluding brutal dictatorships.

the US CAN survive without Canada, but it would require a restructuring of the economy and a spike in import prices as the US searches for new import locations. Loss of exports would hurt too, although as Praxus said, not fatally so.

I for one am in favour of Fortress North America and further integration of immigration and border policies. Also, if possible, we should work out whatever foreign policy disputes we have.

Personally, Im in favour of taking it further than that and having Canadian provinces become states, but this would be intollerable to most Canadians, so what Im proposing is what most Canadians actually do want.

A result of the 11 Sept was a study in how to restructure the trade bwt the two countries. Can't recall it at the moment but done by Queen's University and Boston University.

Essentially, what the US buys from Canada is raw materials and energy (ie oil - 5 out of 6 Canadian produced oil barrels goes to the US). Replacing those in alot of cases would be cost prohibitive.

I'll use oil and the Auto Pact as the example. There is simply no way for the US to rely on oil tankers to replace Canadian oil. In the meantime, American auto industry would be extremely hard pressed to meet parts demand (based upon their Just In Time supply chain) based upon an ever diminishing buyer market (higher oil prices).

I'll leave the ripples to your logical conclusions.

The Free Trade Agreement between the two countries has gone too far for it to be dismissed as inconsequential and non-fatal for both countries.

I would never accuse Canada of paying Terrorists. It is self-evident that Canada does not do that.

However I work for one of the worlds largest banks, and it was only in the last 6 months that we removed Canada from our "Sanctions list", derived from the Bank Of England sanctioned countries list. This was a list of countries whose nationals couldn't open or operate their accounts without further checks. The sanctions list is, of course, based on several factors - one of which being money laundering.

This hasn't changed even after 9/11, even when your government would make changes in your immigration policy.

Or are you exagerating the welfare state? I dont deny it exists, but you dont get money just for living here. And also, it changes province to priovince, or even city to city, as the Ontario government (Ontario gets the most immigrants) downloaded the responsiblity for welfare onto municipalities.

Welfare exspecially the means of antaining the money to provide welfare at least in my opinion is a perversion of what Governments are instituted for.

There were over 150 Canadian Forces personel who fought in the Iraq War. How many Mexican Nationals? ZERO!!!!!

Fact: THIRTY US BRONZE STARS were awarded to 3 PPCLI BG for fighting the Taliban INCLUDING to two Canadian snipers who took out a Taliban bunker pinning down an American platoon (32 men).

Fact: Canadian Naval Task Group Operation Athena was the right flank to Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Fact: Canadian fighter planes were the ONLY ones outside of US planes patrolling AMERICAN airspace immediately after 11 Sept.

Fact: 3 PPCLI is now an honourary Battalion in the 187 BCT, 101st Division (Air Assualt).

I'm not sure what to make of that. That would make them American soldiers first and foremost and thus would that make them Mexican Nationals or American immigrants?

By the same token, there are also alot of Canadians, especially First Nations, in American uniforms although under the First Nations Treaties with both Washington DC and Ottawa, they retain their own national citizenship and tribal rights - don't ask me, I get confused trying to follow my 1st Nations people logic.

So thats your argument? Canada sucks because lots of New Yorkers were at the Jays-Yankees game. Nothing Chretien says can be construed as popular opinion. Most Canadians hate him.

While new yorkers died in the WTC, Canadian airports were swamped with Americans unable to return home and barely getting any news on what was happening other than the U.S. was attacked. We didn't kick the americans out, we fed them, comforted them and sheltered them in our own homes. If you could only visualize how many empty airliners were parked at Vancouver and Abbotsford you could acctually visualize just how swamped canada was. No one complained...not one bit. You mistake one man's (cretien) sentament as the sentament of the whole nation which shows your complete lack of brains and gonads.

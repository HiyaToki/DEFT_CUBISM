McCain, Palin Reunite on a Smaller Stage

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., may have launched Sarah Palin's national political
career, but on Friday it was Palin who was lending a bit of her star power,
joining her former running mate at their first joint campaign event since the
2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In the first of two public events this week to give a boost to McCain's
imperiled re-election bid, Palin headlined a rally that drew thousands to a
dusty fairgrounds outside Tucson. The two strode together onto the stage, joined
by their spouses, an image that evoked, for better or worse, McCain's failed bid
for the White House.
</P>
<P>
Palin described McCain as an elder statesman and a populist and reminded the
crowd of his "maverick" reputation.
</P>
<P>
"We've come a long way from the 2008 campaign," she said as McCain stood behind
her. "It was an honor to stand beside him in 2008, and it's an honor to stand
beside him now, to ask that you, Arizona, for the sake of your state, for the
sake of our country, that you send the maverick back to the United States
Senate."
</P>
<P>
The audience cheered Palin heartily and waved red pompoms and cowboy hats as she
spoke.
</P>
<P>
McCain supporters hope the former Alaska governor's full-throated endorsement,
and her well-established following among conservatives, will fortify the
senator's campaign. He is facing a vigorous Republican primary challenge from
talk show host and former congressman J.D. Hayworth, who has rallied
conservative "tea party" activists to his side.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls show a tightening race, and many in attendance Friday said that,
although they had come to see Palin, they had abandoned support for McCain long
ago.
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I'm here is because of Palin," said Maria Wilcox, 43, who
flashed a palm on which she had written "Palin 2012." McCain, she said, has
"crossed the aisle too many times."
</P>
<P>
Hayworth has gained ground among Republicans by highlighting how McCain gained
the reputation of a maverick _ through taking on not only national leaders, but
also his own party. McCain vociferously opposed President George W. Bush's
landmark tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, and McCain co-authored immigration
legislation with the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., that would have
created a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Since returning to the Senate from his 2008 presidential campaign, however,
McCain has emphasized conservative issues and been the lead Republican opponent
to every hallmark issue for Obama and Democrats in Congress, including the
stimulus legislation pushed through last year and the acrimonious health-care
debate that concluded this week.
</P>
<P>
Far from Washington, Palin has personified the populist anger over those issues.
She has demanded more conservative principles from Republican candidates, and in
an election in upstate New York, even rejected the GOP nominee, whom she
regarded as too moderate to deserve election.
</P>
<P>
Many active in the tea party movement share those sentiments, and they have
adopted Palin as their leading voice, even offering her the keynote address last
month at the inaugural National Tea Party Convention.
</P>
<P>
In Arizona, tea party activists have largely backed Hayworth in the GOP primary,
but McCain supporters are clearly hopeful that Palin's willingness to vouch for
the Arizona senator and stand at his side here and at a Saturday morning event
in Mesa, Ariz., will create second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
Palin described the tea party phenomenon Friday as "a beautiful, radical
movement that is putting the government back on the side of the people," and she
tied McCain to that activism, saying, "Everybody here today that supports John
McCain is part of the tea party movement."
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged the desire for new blood in the Republican party but said there
ought to be room for a "statesman and a hero" such as McCain.
</P>
<P>
When he took to the lectern after Palin, McCain tried to hit the same populist
themes, taking aim at the new health-care law and promising to try to repeal it.
</P>
<P>
"There's something going on out there. There's something going on, and it's a
revolution, a peaceful revolution," he said, stirring up the audience with his
fiery delivery. "We're going to take on this Obamacare."
</P>

Obama Signs Executive Order on Abortion Away From Media Glare
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
By Michael D. Shear
WASHINGTON POST-BLOOMBERG--03-24-10 1532ET
</DATELINE>

<P>
There were no glaring lights or TV cameras when President Barack Obama signed an
executive order Wednesday affirming the continuing ban on federal funding for
abortion. No East Room speeches. Not even a photo op handshake.
</P>
<P>
He did not use 22 pens.
</P>
<P>
But the 876-word, two-page document may be among the most important of his
presidency. The carefully negotiated document assured passage of his health care
legislation by gaining a handful of crucial pro-life votes without shedding pro-
choice ones.
</P>
<P>
"The executive order found a sweet spot, which I'm surprised existed," said
William Galston, of the Brookings Institution. "Something that didn't send the
base of the party into a tizzy but seems to have satisfied a very important
minority within the party. It was the model of win-win pragmatism."
</P>
<P>
A strict reading of the order suggests that it does little more than restate the
existing prohibition on abortion funding, known as the Hyde amendment, and make
sure that government officials "are aware of their responsibilities, new and
old."
</P>
<P>
But that didn't stop pro-choice activists from condemning Obama for agreeing to
it, or keep pro-life groups from asserting that it falls short.
</P>
<P>
The National Organization for Women declared Sunday night that Obama's
commitment to abortion rights is "shaky at best" and said his willingness to
sign the order demonstrated that "it is acceptable to negotiate health care on
the backs of women."
</P>
<P>
For the activist groups, overheated rhetoric is part of the fundraising game. A
threat to their core agenda can help them raise enormous amounts of money from
their members and supporters. NOW declared Monday that it would launch an effort
to repeal the Hyde Amendment, the more than three-decade-old annual budgetary
provision that Obama affirmed.
</P>
<P>
As Galston notes, the president's decision to sign the order did not drive a
single pro-choice lawmaker to vote against it, suggesting that the substance of
the letter was less important than its symbolic value.
</P>
<P>
But for the president, the order reflects a willingness to ask some of his most
devoted constituents -- women, gays, unions and African-Americans -- to swallow
a few toads while he battles on behalf of his broader agenda.
</P>
<P>
Obama has asked gays and lesbians to be patient when it comes to "don't ask,
don't tell." There is little indication that the president wants to push the
"card check" legislation on union voting that his allies desperately want. And
African-American legislators have griped publicly about the lack of attention
from Obama to issues important to their communities.
</P>
<P>
With Sunday's executive order on abortion, the president and his lawyers appear
to have struck a delicate balance.
</P>
<P>
He was in no mood to publicize it.

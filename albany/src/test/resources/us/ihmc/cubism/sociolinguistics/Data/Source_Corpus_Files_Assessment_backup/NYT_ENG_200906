NEW TREATMENT FOR CANCER FOUND TO WORK IN ANIMALS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new method of attacking cancer cells, developed by researchers
in Australia, has proved surprisingly effective in animal tests.
</P>
<P>
The method is intended to sidestep two major drawbacks of
standard chemotherapy: the treatment's lack of specificity and the
fact that cancer cells often develop resistance.
</P>
<P>
In one striking use of the method, reported online Sunday in
Nature Biotechnology, mice were implanted with a human uterine
tumor that was highly aggressive and resistant to many drugs. All
of the treated animals were free of tumor cells after 70 days of
treatment; the untreated mice were dead after a month.
</P>
<P>
The lead researchers, Dr. Jennifer A. MacDiarmid and Dr.
Himanshu Brahmbhatt, say their company, EnGeneIC of suburban
Sydney, has achieved a similar outcome in dogs with advanced brain
cancer. "We have been treating more than 20 dogs and have
spectacular results," Brahmbhatt said. "Pretty much every dog has
responded, and some are in remission." These experiments have not
yet been published.
</P>
<P>
Cancer experts who were not involved with the research say that
the new method is of great interest, but that many treatments that
work well in laboratory mice turn out to be ineffective in
patients.
</P>
<P>
Bert Vogelstein, a leading cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins
University, called the method "a creative and promising line of
research," but noted the general odds against success.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, our track record shows that far less than 1
percent of our promising approaches actually make the grade in
patients," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EnGeneIC researchers said they had conducted successful
safety tests in a large number of monkeys and will start safety
trials in patients with all kinds of solid tumors in three
Melbourne hospitals next month. They said they had discussed
licensing their technology with large pharmaceutical companies and
others.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephen H. Friend, head of cancer research at Merck until
early this year, said he had been following EnGeneIC's work for
more than a year, and praised the company for trying a method that
others had written off without trying.
</P>
<P>
"I consider the approach is remarkable and more than
intriguing," said Friend, who is now at Sage Bionetworks in
Seattle. But he warned that cancer cells are very versatile and can
"evolve around any pressure you put on them," so that no single
approach is likely to afford a cure.
</P>
<P>
The EnGeneIC method uses minicells to deliver a variety of
agents to tumor cells, including both anti-cancer toxins and
mechanisms for suppressing the genes that make tumors resistant to
toxins.
</P>
<P>
The minicells are generated from mutant bacteria which, each
time they divide, pinch off small bubbles of cell membrane. The
minicells can be loaded with chemicals and coated with antibodies
that direct them toward tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
No tumor cell, so far as is known, produces a specific surface
molecule for toxins to act on. But 80 percent of solid tumors have
their cell surfaces studded with extra-large amounts of the
receptor for a particular hormone, known as epidermal growth
factor.
</P>
<P>
The minicells can be coated with an antibody that recognizes
this receptor, so they are more likely to attach themselves to
tumors than to the normal cells of the body. The tumor cells engulf
and destroy the minicells, a standard defense against bacteria, and
in doing so are exposed to whatever cargo the minicells carry.
</P>
<P>
What also helps direct the minicells toward tumors, the EnGeneIC
researchers say, is that the blood vessels around tumors tend to be
leaky, and the minicells are small enough to leave the circulation
at the leak sites.
</P>
<P>
The minicells do not seem to be highly provocative to the immune
system, even though they are made of bacterial cell membrane. The
reason may be that the provocative parts of the membrane are masked
by antibodies with which the minicells are coated, Brahmbhatt said.
</P>
<P>
In the experiments reported Sunday, EnGeneIC treated
cancer-ridden mice with two waves of minicells. The first wave
contained an agent that suppressed an important gene for toxin
resistance. The gene makes a protein that pumps toxin out of cells,
and is a major cause of the resistance that tumors often develop
toward chemotherapeutic agents.
</P>
<P>
After the toxin-expelling gene had been knocked down in the
tumor cells, the EnGeneIC researchers injected a second wave of
minicells, each loaded with half a million molecules of
doxorubicin, a toxin used in chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The two-wave treatment arrested tumor growth in mice implanted
with either human colon or human breast tumors, and enabled mice
with drug-resistant human uterine tumors to eliminate the tumors
altogether.
</P>
<P>
"The technology looks very good," said Dr. Bruce Stillman,
president of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on New York's Long
Island. It provides a general method of delivering chemicals to
tumors, he said, especially those that are usually degraded in the
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
Stillman, who has advised EnGeneIC and is a co-author of its
report, said the minicells could be particularly helpful for
delivering silencing RNAs, a promising new class of drug that is
rapidly destroyed in the body unless protected.
</P>
<P>
Though the minicells can be varied to attack different receptors
and to import any gene of interest on elements called plasmids, the
method still has several hurdles to jump.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert M. Hoffman, of the University of California, San
Diego, said that the minicells were "good strategy and good
science" but that the researchers had implanted the human tumors
under the mice's skin, a position from which they do not usually
spread through the body. So the experiments do not answer the
question of whether minicells can attack metastasized cancer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, who is president of AntiCancer Inc., has obtained
striking remissions with metastasized cancers in mice by treating
them with salmonella bacteria. The bacteria have been engineered to
lack two kinds of amino acid, which makes them unable to grow in
normal tissues. In cancer cells, however, where the missing amino
acids are in more plentiful supply, the bacteria are highly
virulent and kill the cells.
</P>
<P>
The idea of treating cancer with bacteria goes back to the 19th
century, when physicians noticed that cancer patients who became
infected sometimes enjoyed a remission. Both Hoffman's method and
the minicells, in different ways, revisit these old observations.
Both may face special scrutiny from regulators concerned at the
prospect of putting bacteria into people.
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said his studies with the defective bacteria were going
well and that his company might be ready to start a safety test in
patients in two years if it can find a good partner. Use of
bacteria in cancer "is an old story but there is definitely a lot
of promise there," he said.

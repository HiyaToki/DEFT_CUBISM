WASHINGTON -- Despite recent accusations of racism and homophobia, Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) stuck to his libertarian principles on Sunday, criticizing the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it "undermine[d] the concept of liberty" and "destroyed the principle of private property and private choices."

"If you try to improve relationships by forcing and telling people what they can't do, and you ignore and undermine the principles of liberty, then the government can come into our bedrooms," Paul told Candy Crowley on CNN's "State of the Union." "And that's exactly what has happened. Look at what's happened with the PATRIOT Act. They can come into our houses, our bedrooms our businesses... And it was started back then."

The Civil Rights Act repealed the notorious Jim Crow laws; forced schools, bathrooms and buses to desegregate; and banned employment discrimination. Although Paul was not around to weigh in on the landmark legislation at the time, he had the chance to cast a symbolic vote against it in 2004, when the House of Representatives took up a resolution "recognizing and honoring the 40th anniversary of congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." Paul was the only member who voted " no."

P.S. Your a partisan shitstain on the clean white undies of the United States. Go fuck yourself you do nothing liberal. All you and your party can do is bitch and complain while holding your hand out expecting others to provide for you.

Paul's stance on the issue indicates his ignorance of – or contempt for – the Constitution, its case law, and the rule of law.

The Civil Right Act of 1964 doesn't attempt to ‘legislate morality,' nor does it bestow a ‘special privilege' on anyone. And no one lost his rights in favor of another.

To maintain such nonsense only exhibits one's ignorance of the Act.

When the Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it determined, among other things, that segregation statues – such as restrictions in public accommodations – violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, where laws may not be enacted which effect only a particular class of persons. See: <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0379_0241_ZO.html">Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States</a>

Indeed, the Act ensures that all Americans have equal protection and access to the laws, just as required by the Constitution.

This makes no sense.

During the Civil Rights Era and beyond, it was progressives alone who fought against conservatives and their effort to restrict civil rights, particularly with regard to African-Americans. Liberals fought for the rule of law, and to ensure the fundamental tenets of the Constitution remain in place: equal access to the law, equal protection of the law, and the right to due process.

Paul is not nuts, hes ignorant, as is his followers.

They maintain this naïve, reactionary fantasy as to what they think the Constitution means. My best extrapolation is that they mistakenly perceive the Constitution as a blueprint of government only; they fail to understand the Constitution is for the most part a legal document, a product of centuries of the development of Anglo-American legal tradition, and exists only in the context of its case law.

Theyre entitled to maintain their pathetic fantasy as to the Constitution, of course, albeit subjective and meaningless.

The left doesn't just kill rights at the Federal level. They like to work it at the local level as best they can.

Chicago just passed the most restrictive gun laws in the nation, and the left cheered.
[I can't recall where] Some conservatives wanted to restrict the right to an abortion and the left screamed and screamed about rights.

So by taking that into context, the left doesn't want us to have spelled out rights, but wants us to be able to kill babies based on a twisting of the right to privacy.

Nobody in this thread has called Ron Paul a racist (admittedly, the words "nuts" and "neanderthal" have been bandied about). People have merely noted that he criticized the Civil Rights act. It's perfectly possible for non-racists to facilitate racism. As Michael Gerson put it ( <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ron-pauls-quest-to-undo-the-party-of-lincoln/2011/12/30/gIQAOrlyUP_story.html">Ron Paul&amp;rsquo;s quest to undo the party of Lincoln - The Washington Post</a> )

"Whatever his personal views, Paul categorically opposes the legal construct that ended state-sanctioned racism."

See: <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0379_0241_ZO.html">Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States</a>

Indeed, the Act ensures that all Americans have equal protection and access to the laws, just as required by the Constitution.

Ron Paul's very idea that business is somehow completely "private" is specious. It depends a great deal of the public space and public funding.

It's abominable that anyone supported the denial of access to good and services simply because of ethnicity or skin color.

</quote>

Its abominable that in a free country the government mandates to every businessman who he can and cannot do business with. Everyone that owns property who they can and cannot rent to, etc.

</quote>

Yeah!

What kind of a "free" country prevents business owners from keeping people of a different skin color from frequenting their establishments?

Jeez, America! WTF?!

The Red/Blue Paradox
Why do liberal states give while conservative states take?
Veronique de Rugy from the August/September 2011 issue

We hear it all the time: Red states are for limited government; blue states are for heavy spending. While this may be true when it comes to broad political preferences, its false as measured by patterns of federal spending.

When you compare the 50 laboratories of democracy after sorting them based on how their citizens voted in November 2008, only 10 Democratic-voting states are net recipients of federal subsidies, as opposed to 22 Republican states. Only one red state (Texas) is a net payer of federal taxes, as opposed to 16 blue states. One blue state (Rhode Island) pays as much as it gets.

Political scientists have been wrestling with this apparent paradox for years. One explanation sometimes offered is that the red states, on average, have smaller populations. In Political Determinants of Federal Expenditure at the State Level, published by the journal Public Choice in 2005, two University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa economists, Gary Hoover and Paul Pecorino, note that residents of low-population states have more per capita representation in Congress, since every state, regardless of population, has two senators. That edge, Hoover and Pecorino argue, translates into more federal handouts. The results are conspicuous in the case of homeland security grants, where small, rural, relatively low-risk states get much more money per capita than urban states that face bigger terrorist threats.

This makes no sense.

During the Civil Rights Era and beyond, it was progressives alone who fought against conservatives and their effort to restrict civil rights, particularly with regard to African-Americans. Liberals fought for the rule of law, and to ensure the fundamental tenets of the Constitution remain in place: equal access to the law, equal protection of the law, and the right to due process.

By Laura Bassett

WASHINGTON -- Despite recent accusations of racism and homophobia, Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) stuck to his libertarian principles on Sunday, criticizing the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it "undermine[d] the concept of liberty" and "destroyed the principle of private property and private choices."

"If you try to improve relationships by forcing and telling people what they can't do, and you ignore and undermine the principles of liberty, then the government can come into our bedrooms," Paul told Candy Crowley on CNN's "State of the Union." "And that's exactly what has happened. Look at what's happened with the PATRIOT Act. They can come into our houses, our bedrooms our businesses... And it was started back then."

The Civil Rights Act repealed the notorious Jim Crow laws; forced schools, bathrooms and buses to desegregate; and banned employment discrimination. Although Paul was not around to weigh in on the landmark legislation at the time, he had the chance to cast a symbolic vote against it in 2004, when the House of Representatives took up a resolution "recognizing and honoring the 40th anniversary of congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." Paul was the only member who voted " no."

I know where you are going but it's silly. It isn't like the Civil Rights Act couldn't have been written differently. While telling us it was doing a good thing, it was also seizing an opportunity to reach further into the lives of citizens. The problem with the Liberals and Conservatives both is that you want the government to use it's power to control people. You simply disagree on what should be controlled. Ron Paul and Libertarians don't suffer from that kind of blindness and hypocrisy. Ron Paul stands for liberty for ALL, not just special interest groups.

This qoute, like many responses to Paul's views, is misleading demagoguery, if not an outright lie. It insinuates that Paul supports state-sanctioned racism - the opposite of his position on the Civil Rights Act. In fact, the banning of Jim Crow laws is the part of the act he agrees with and why he wouldn't consider repealing it.

What Paul is doing here, what the status quo pundits find so repugnant, is speaking up for property rights.

<quote>
Paul explained that while he supports the fact that the legislation repealed the notorious Jim Crow laws, which forced racial segregation, he believes it is the government, not the people, that causes racial tensions by passing overreaching laws that institutionalize slavery and segregation. Today's race problems, he said, result from the war on drugs, the flawed U.S. court system and the military."The real problem we face today is the discrimination in our court system, the war on drugs. Just think of how biased that is against the minorities," he said. "They go into prison much way out of proportion to their numbers. They get the death penalty out of proportion with their numbers. And if you look at what minorities suffer in ordinary wars, whether there's a draft or no draft, they suffer much out of proposition. So those are the kind of discrimination that have to be dealt with, but you don't ever want to undermine the principle of private property and private choices in order to solve some of these problems."

</quote>

He's questioning the assumption that its necessary, or even a good idea, to put government in charge of deciding who we must do business with or for what reasons we can decline. We can solve our problems, even intractable issues like racism, without enacting "thoughtcrime".

Forcing people by law to not act racist doesn't remove the racism.

The only thing that changed in this country since the civil rights movement was that now people just keep their racism to themselves.

We grew as a society on racial tolerance IN SPITE of the civil rights act, not because of it.

Today, if the act was repealed, and a business owner banned black patrons, that business would be lucky if it managed to stay afloat for a full week. Not only would people in the local area boycott it, but the media would pick up the story and the contempt for the business would quickly grow nationally and the business would die. And the owner would probably never be able to redeem himself.

Civil Rights laws never took away your rights to hate. You just couldn't extend your hatred to our public thoroughfares. Your business operates as a part of our society. You want to run your business in our town or our state you have to meet certain standards of conduct. If you do not want to meet those standards of conduct, you do not have to run a business in our society

Forcing people by law to not act racist doesn't remove the racism.

The only thing that changed in this country since the civil rights movement was that now people just keep their racism to themselves.

We grew as a society on racial tolerance IN SPITE of the civil rights act, not because of it.

Today, if the act was repealed, and a business owner banned black patrons, that business would be lucky if it managed to stay afloat for a full week.

A movement generates interest towards ideas that were otherwise considered fringe. As more people joined the movement, the ideas grew, and more people's eyes were opened.

The same way the tea party and OWS opened people's eyes up to ideas which have grown. These 2 movements didn't need laws to force people to hate government spending, or hate wall street banks. If the idea is powerful enough, you don't need to be forced.

Nobody in this thread has called Ron Paul a racist (admittedly, the words "nuts" and "neanderthal" have been bandied about). People have merely noted that he criticized the Civil Rights act. It's perfectly possible for non-racists to facilitate racism. As Michael Gerson put it ( <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ron-pauls-quest-to-undo-the-party-of-lincoln/2011/12/30/gIQAOrlyUP_story.html">Ron Paul&amp;rsquo;s quest to undo the party of Lincoln - The Washington Post</a> )

"Whatever his personal views, Paul categorically opposes the legal construct that ended state-sanctioned racism."

</quote>

This qoute, like many responses to Paul's views, is misleading demagoguery, if not an outright lie. It insinuates that Paul supports state-sanctioned racism - the opposite of his position on the Civil Rights Act. In fact, the banning of Jim Crow laws is the part of the act he agrees with and why he wouldn't consider repealing it.

What Paul is doing here, what the status quo pundits find so repugnant, is speaking up for property rights.

<quote>
Paul explained that while he supports the fact that the legislation repealed the notorious Jim Crow laws, which forced racial segregation, he believes it is the government, not the people, that causes racial tensions by passing overreaching laws that institutionalize slavery and segregation. Today's race problems, he said, result from the war on drugs, the flawed U.S. court system and the military."The real problem we face today is the discrimination in our court system, the war on drugs. Just think of how biased that is against the minorities," he said. "They go into prison much way out of proportion to their numbers. They get the death penalty out of proportion with their numbers. And if you look at what minorities suffer in ordinary wars, whether there's a draft or no draft, they suffer much out of proposition. So those are the kind of discrimination that have to be dealt with, but you don't ever want to undermine the principle of private property and private choices in order to solve some of these problems."

</quote>

He's questioning the assumption that its necessary, or even a good idea, to put government in charge of deciding who we must do business with or for what reasons we can decline. We can solve our problems, even intractable issues like racism, without enacting "thoughtcrime".

</quote>

Black codes and Jim Crow laws were around for how many generations?

At what point were the beneficent southern people of their own accord going to actually get around to doing it on their own?

How long should it have been allowed to continue?

</quote>

It shouldn't have been allowed to get started in the first place. But I think you might want to re-read. He's adamantly opposed to Jim Crow laws and state-sanctioned racism. That's the part of the Act he agrees with. Equal protection is essential to a free society.

Correct.

In Heart of Atlanta Motel the Court ruled that racial discrimination with regard to public accommodation adversely effected economic activity within and among the states, and Congress is authorized to regulate that activity:

<quote>
We therefore conclude that the action of the Congress in the adoption of the Act as applied here to a motel which concededly serves interstate travelers is within the power granted it by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, as interpreted by this Court for 140 years.

In addition, the notion that free markets would have eventually addressed the race problem is naïve and unrealistic.

Thanks Jillian. But I think we're all well aware of Paul's position on abortion. Fortunately, he's opposed to making it a federal issue. I'd rather he were pro choice myself. That's one of a handful of issues I disagree with him on. But given that I agree with him on 85% of the issues and disagree with the other candidates on 85% of the issues, the choice if obvious.

I believe that Paul and his supporters truly believe that libertarian values, once implemented, will result in a kind of civil rights utopia, that state regulation, no matter how well-intended, has an inadvertently adverse effect on civil liberties.

This fails to take into consideration, however, the inherent imperfection of the various market forces libertarians would depend upon once the Constitution and its case law are removed from the equation.

To assume, for example, that the market would address the problem of a racist hotel owner who refuses to accommodate blacks by being put out of business by outraged consumers who refuse to do business with a racist business, is naïve and unrealistic. Markets were not designed to ensure the consistent application of the fundamental principles expressed by the Constitution, that the laws be applied equally.

</quote>

Are you able to understand that opposing the legislation and it's broad scope, and the wording of the bill, is not the same as opposing civil rights? Honest question.

</quote>

I understand that a bill with "Civil Rights" in its name does not necessarily advance the cause of civil rights, anymore than a bill with the word "PATRIOT" is necessarily patriotic or a bill with "reform" is necessarily a reform. In this case however, I think that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 actually did advance the cause of civil rights. To oppose the bill, then, amounts to opposing certain civil rights.

It is important to note that the portions of the bill restricting the rights of certain private businesses to discriminate on the basis of race were not motivated by an abstract or speculative concern. They were motivated by centuries of history in which both government and private individuals oppressed an entire race. Ron Paul's ideal version of the bill, which I understand to include those restrictions on public entities but exclude those on private entities, would have been a dramatically weaker half-measure.

About 80% of Republicans and 60% of Democrats supported the bill. However, when adjusted by region (with the South defined as the old Confederacy and the North as the rest of the country) Democrats were substantially more likely to support the bill. In fact, none of the (relatively few) Southern Republicans supported the bill, and Northern Republicans were more than twice as likely to oppose the bill as were their Democratic counterparts.

Of course, both parties have changed substantially in the time between then and now.

Ronald explains it much better than I...

Natural rights are every mans at birth and are not State-granted. If each man has an equal claim to liberty, that is, the use of his rights, he can be limited in his freedom only by the claims of other men to an equal share of liberty. The circle of rights around every man extends as far as it may without intruding on the rights of other men. For this reason are the rights granted by the State bogus rights. A right to receive welfare, for example, is invalid since it requires the abridgement, however partial, of the rights of the citizen who is compelled to pay for the welfare benefits given to someone else. Natural rights, by contrast, require no abridgment of another individuals rights to exist, but are limited only by the same natural rights of another person.

Certainly in abolishing state-sanctioned racism it was good and necessary. But I think it's reasonable to question whether the thoughcrime aspect was worth it, or even that effective in the long run. Racism is still with us, and much of it is fueled by resentment of intrusive government policy. If would could have found another way, a way that didn't inject government into hiring decisions (for example), and in a way that didn't sacrifice property rights, don't you think that would have been better in the long run?

By Laura Bassett

WASHINGTON -- Despite recent accusations of racism and homophobia, Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) stuck to his libertarian principles on Sunday, criticizing the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it "undermine[d] the concept of liberty" and "destroyed the principle of private property and private choices."

"If you try to improve relationships by forcing and telling people what they can't do, and you ignore and undermine the principles of liberty, then the government can come into our bedrooms," Paul told Candy Crowley on CNN's "State of the Union." "And that's exactly what has happened. Look at what's happened with the PATRIOT Act. They can come into our houses, our bedrooms our businesses... And it was started back then."

The Civil Rights Act repealed the notorious Jim Crow laws; forced schools, bathrooms and buses to desegregate; and banned employment discrimination. Although Paul was not around to weigh in on the landmark legislation at the time, he had the chance to cast a symbolic vote against it in 2004, when the House of Representatives took up a resolution "recognizing and honoring the 40th anniversary of congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." Paul was the only member who voted " no."

Ronald explains it much better than I...

Natural rights are every mans at birth and are not State-granted. If each man has an equal claim to liberty, that is, the use of his rights, he can be limited in his freedom only by the claims of other men to an equal share of liberty. The circle of rights around every man extends as far as it may without intruding on the rights of other men. For this reason are the rights granted by the State bogus rights. A right to receive welfare, for example, is invalid since it requires the abridgement, however partial, of the rights of the citizen who is compelled to pay for the welfare benefits given to someone else. Natural rights, by contrast, require no abridgment of another individuals rights to exist, but are limited only by the same natural rights of another person.

 Ronald Cooney, The Freeman [October 1972]

You mean if we were able to wish away the overt racism that existed in this country? Paul is showing why he is unfit to lead this country. He has never accomplished anything as a Congressman. All he does is stand by his simplistic principles and vote No.

That is not leadership. The President of the United States as substantial power both at home and abroad. Great Presidents know how to use it. Paul's view of the presidency is to use his veto power to enforce his principles whether it is good for the country or not.

That is why Paul will never be elected. He allows idealism to overturn practicality

As an African American who was born and raised in Mississippi, and as a republican who plans on voting for Ron Paul in the primary, I'll say this:

I understand Paul's view of the world. I understand Paul's reasoning behind not supporting civil rights legislation. He does not believe that government should intervene in the practices of private businesses. If you don't wish to hire "African Americans" then you shouldn't have too.

I also want to say, though I agree with Paul on many issues (anti-gun control, less regulation, audit the fed, prohibition, freedom of speech, less taxes, control the border, no U.N., end the EPA, smaller government, bring troops home, etc) I completely disagree with him on this issue. I believe that every business has it's own right to govern itself, I also believe I have the fundamental right as a human being to be treated and looked upon as a human being and not as an "African American". No matter how flawed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 may or may not have been, THIS was it's major accomplishment, the assurance that when it came to both the private and public sector my right to be considered "human" rather than "black" was protected.

When I send my application into a job, I should not have to worry about whether or not this job hires "coloreds", neither should anyone else have to worry about whether this job hires their particular shade of color, race, or ethnicity. I should only have to worry about whether or not I am qualified for this particular job (Mind you all that I am NOT arguing the merits of AA, just the idea that individual liberties should be protected). The big difference between myself and Paul here is that I believe I have a right not to be discriminated against because of the color of my skin, while he does not see this as a right, but theorizes that the free market will take care of itself when it comes to discrimination (ie when people see that businesses are racist, they won't go and those businesses will be boycotted/abandoned and either have to close or change their business policies).

There's a fundamental flaw in this theory, and history has shown this from the simple fact that there were thousands of business that had racist practices during Jim Crow that thrived. The flaw is, requiring businesses to treat HUMANITY with equal respect and dignity is not a concept opposed to individual freedoms. Quite the opposite. It protects individual freedoms.

With that said, though I don't agree with Paul on THIS, I still believe he's the best choice for this nation at this present time, and I do not believe his stance on this issue comes from his being prejudice or racist, but because he has a fundamentally different understanding of the issue than I do and many others do. I disagree with his understanding. But I disagree respectfully, seeing the merit in his arguments. The fact is nobody is talking about repealing the 1964 Civil Rights Act, I don't even believe that's possible considering that nobody in congress would vote for such a repeal. If you really want to talk about Paul's record on issues regarding race, let's talk about addressing the government run drug war which Paul understands is statistically detrimental to the African American community.

Which goes to the fact the Civil Rights Act was not designed to end racism, it was designed to end segregation and enforce the principles enshrined in the 14th Amendment. It addressed the states failure to abide by the Constitution and rule of law  it addressed legal, not social, issues.

I don't think of Ron Paul as a racist. I just think he is too wrapped up in his libertarian values to do what is right. He is perfectly willing to trade away civil rights, gay rights and worker rights if they conflict with his libertarian values.

</quote>

I believe that Paul and his supporters truly believe that libertarian values, once implemented, will result in a kind of civil rights utopia, that state regulation, no matter how well-intended, has an inadvertently adverse effect on civil liberties.

This fails to take into consideration, however, the inherent imperfection of the various market forces libertarians would depend upon once the Constitution and its case law are removed from the equation.

To assume, for example, that the market would address the problem of a racist hotel owner who refuses to accommodate blacks by being put out of business by outraged consumers who refuse to do business with a racist business, is naïve and unrealistic. Markets were not designed to ensure the consistent application of the fundamental principles expressed by the Constitution, that the laws be applied equally.

Nobody in this thread has called Ron Paul a racist (admittedly, the words "nuts" and "neanderthal" have been bandied about). People have merely noted that he criticized the Civil Rights act. It's perfectly possible for non-racists to facilitate racism. As Michael Gerson put it ( <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ron-pauls-quest-to-undo-the-party-of-lincoln/2011/12/30/gIQAOrlyUP_story.html">Ron Paul&amp;rsquo;s quest to undo the party of Lincoln - The Washington Post</a> )

"Whatever his personal views, Paul categorically opposes the legal construct that ended state-sanctioned racism."

</quote>

Are you able to understand that opposing the legislation and it's broad scope, and the wording of the bill, is not the same as opposing civil rights? Honest question.

</quote>

I understand that a bill with "Civil Rights" in its name does not necessarily advance the cause of civil rights, anymore than a bill with the word "PATRIOT" is necessarily patriotic or a bill with "reform" is necessarily a reform. In this case however, I think that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 actually did advance the cause of civil rights. To oppose the bill, then, amounts to opposing certain civil rights.

It is important to note that the portions of the bill restricting the rights of certain private businesses to discriminate on the basis of race were not motivated by an abstract or speculative concern. They were motivated by centuries of history in which both government and private individuals oppressed an entire race. Ron Paul's ideal version of the bill, which I understand to include those restrictions on public entities but exclude those on private entities, would have been a dramatically weaker half-measure.

Ronald explains it much better than I...

Natural rights are every mans at birth and are not State-granted. If each man has an equal claim to liberty, that is, the use of his rights, he can be limited in his freedom only by the claims of other men to an equal share of liberty. The circle of rights around every man extends as far as it may without intruding on the rights of other men. For this reason are the rights granted by the State bogus rights. A right to receive welfare, for example, is invalid since it requires the abridgement, however partial, of the rights of the citizen who is compelled to pay for the welfare benefits given to someone else. Natural rights, by contrast, require no abridgment of another individuals rights to exist, but are limited only by the same natural rights of another person.

 Ronald Cooney, The Freeman [October 1972]

I actually pondered this bull shit murder trap you have laid while I was at the gym. You are wrong.

There are laws agianst murder, and we punish them by sending them to prison (I wish we would bring back hanging, see how cool it is to be a criminal when real justice is dispensed) not because it is morally wrong, but to protect the other citizens from a predator. It has nothing to do with morals, it has to do with survival and safety of the community.

I've seen Paul on this subject before. It's easy to jump to the conclusion that his is a racist position, but I don't believe that to be the case. I think it's a radical-libertarian, radical-free-market position. Paul was all for striking down the Jim Crow laws, but thought that was as far as the federal government could or should go. Where he had a problem was in prohibiting a private business from discriminating on the basis of race. He believes in an absolute right of a business owner to conduct his business as he sees fit, no matter how wrong and appalling the basis for his decisions.

I disagree with him, of course. A business does not have any such absolute right, something which follows inevitably from the principle that your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins. As an entity dealing with the public in consequential ways, a business is not in the same category as private behavior engaged in at home. Businesses employ people and so impact people's livelihoods; they sell products and so impact public safety; they conduct operations that impact the environment. In all of these areas they potentially infringe the rights of others more than people do when engaging in purely private behavior. As such, they are subject to a greater degree of scrutiny and restraint. Or at least that is how I see it, and why I believe that Paul and other free-market purists are wrong.

A right of business owners to discriminate on the basis of race is inconsistent with the right of people to employment and housing regardless of race; both rights cannot simultaneously exist. The Civil Rights Act restrains private business as well as state governments for good reason.

So anyway, murder is morally wrong no matter how someone tries to spin to and to make a law against it is to legislate that morality.

</quote>

That's not what is meant by the phrase 'legislate morality'.

Legislating morality is when we use government to enforce 'righteous living'. Some people think the purpose of government is to define the good life and then push all of us toward it via whatever means necessary, and I reject that. Government should be there to protect our freedoms and make it possible for us all to get along, pursuing whatever 'good life' we prefer - not to tell us how to live.

<quote>
The Election of 1960

By the 1960 presidential campaign, civil rights had emerged as a crucial issue. Just a few weeks before the election, Martin Luther King, Jr., was arrested while leading a protest in Atlanta, Georgia. John Kennedy phoned Coretta Scott King to express his concern while a call from Robert Kennedy to the judge helped secure her husband's safe release. The Kennedys' personal intervention led to a public endorsement by Martin Luther King, Sr., the influential father of the civil rights leader.

Across the nation, more than 70 percent of African Americans voted for Kennedy, and these votes provided the winning edge in several key states. When President Kennedy took office in January 1961, African Americans had high expectations for the new administration.

But Kennedy's narrow election victory and small working margin in Congress left him cautious. He was reluctant to lose southern support for legislation on many fronts by pushing too hard on civil rights legislation. Instead, he appointed unprecedented numbers of African Americans to high-level positions in the administration and strengthened the Civil Rights Commission. He spoke out in favor of school desegregation, praised a number of cities for integrating their schools, and put Vice President Lyndon Johnson in charge of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. Attorney General Robert Kennedy turned his attention to voting rights, initiating five times the number of suits brought during the previous administration.

And this...

On September 30, 1962, riots erupted on the campus of the University of Mississippi in Oxford where locals, students, and committed segregationists had gathered to protest the enrollment of James Meredith, a black Air Force veteran attempting to integrate the all-white school. Despite the presence of more than 120 federal marshals who were on hand to protect Meredith from harm, the crowd turned violent after nightfall, and authorities struggled to maintain order. When the smoke cleared the following morning, two civilians were dead and scores more were reported injured.

For Meredith, the riot was perhaps a fitting coda to a process that began almost two years earlier when he brought suit against the school, alleging that he was denied admission on the basis of race. Although a lower court sided with the university, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit issued a decision in June 1962 ordering the school to admit Meredith the following fall, thereby ensuring a showdown between the federal government and Mississippi's segregationist state government. After spending the night of September 30 under federal protection, Meredith was allowed to register for classes the following morning, and became the first black graduate from the university in August 1963.

This makes no sense.

During the Civil Rights Era and beyond, it was progressives alone who fought against conservatives and their effort to restrict civil rights, particularly with regard to African-Americans. Liberals fought for the rule of law, and to ensure the fundamental tenets of the Constitution remain in place: equal access to the law, equal protection of the law, and the right to due process.

Great, the rights of hundreds were violated so one person could have what they want. Fantastic. Fast forward a few years and the majority is taxed to death, mandated to death, watched to death, regulated to death. All so a few different minority groups can the rent they lobbied for from the government.

This makes no sense.

During the Civil Rights Era and beyond, it was progressives alone who fought against conservatives and their effort to restrict civil rights, particularly with regard to African-Americans. Liberals fought for the rule of law, and to ensure the fundamental tenets of the Constitution remain in place: equal access to the law, equal protection of the law, and the right to due process.

If it wasnt for the racism of progressives, the civil rights movement would never have needed to exist.

And this...

On September 30, 1962, riots erupted on the campus of the University of Mississippi in Oxford where locals, students, and committed segregationists had gathered to protest the enrollment of James Meredith, a black Air Force veteran attempting to integrate the all-white school. Despite the presence of more than 120 federal marshals who were on hand to protect Meredith from harm, the crowd turned violent after nightfall, and authorities struggled to maintain order. When the smoke cleared the following morning, two civilians were dead and scores more were reported injured.

For Meredith, the riot was perhaps a fitting coda to a process that began almost two years earlier when he brought suit against the school, alleging that he was denied admission on the basis of race. Although a lower court sided with the university, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit issued a decision in June 1962 ordering the school to admit Meredith the following fall, thereby ensuring a showdown between the federal government and Mississippi's segregationist state government. After spending the night of September 30 under federal protection, Meredith was allowed to register for classes the following morning, and became the first black graduate from the university in August 1963.

By Laura Bassett

WASHINGTON -- Despite recent accusations of racism and homophobia, Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) stuck to his libertarian principles on Sunday, criticizing the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it "undermine[d] the concept of liberty" and "destroyed the principle of private property and private choices."

"If you try to improve relationships by forcing and telling people what they can't do, and you ignore and undermine the principles of liberty, then the government can come into our bedrooms," Paul told Candy Crowley on CNN's "State of the Union." "And that's exactly what has happened. Look at what's happened with the PATRIOT Act. They can come into our houses, our bedrooms our businesses... And it was started back then."

The Civil Rights Act repealed the notorious Jim Crow laws; forced schools, bathrooms and buses to desegregate; and banned employment discrimination. Although Paul was not around to weigh in on the landmark legislation at the time, he had the chance to cast a symbolic vote against it in 2004, when the House of Representatives took up a resolution "recognizing and honoring the 40th anniversary of congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." Paul was the only member who voted " no."

</quote>

I don't like the civil rights act either....

Who the fuck is anyone to tell another individual what they can and cannot do??

The civil rights act is a form of social engineering...

I'm no racist either, however as a libertarian our government has ZERO right telling others what position to hold on others.....

I suppose if you have a problem with a business that is say opposed to blacks then boycott that said business, however our government has absolutely no authority to FORCE a business to hire a black, gay, Muslim, Christian, Jew or even a one armed man for that matter..

Per Tenth Amendment I suppose a state could but not the federal government...

Besides, these days I don't think anyone really cares about race, sex or religion, just as long as the individual is competent in their position...

Please.

The racists and "anti-government crazies" are going to vote for whoever the republican nominee is. Don't pin that group on Paul.

Who is the government? It is the governing body established by the Consitution of the United States. Agreed to as the supreme law of the land, by the founders, and sustained as such by all ensuing generations of the American People. That is who the government is, and that government says you can't discriminate by race in a public establishment of business.

That's murder....

As a matter of fact the KKK was the "ACORN" of the Democratic Party.

As usual the Democrats were authoritarian then and they have never changed....

The democrats were the ones stringing up black folks - that IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE.

Southern Democrats were the most racist "people" you could possibly imagine...

Republicans were never racist.... Back in those days democrats were conservative - Republicans back then were more liberal than the democrats...

Funny how little modern progressives know about US culture pre 1970 or so...

It's common knowledge..

I suppose one must have an interest in history to even learn such a thought considering democrats WRONGLY, KNOWINGLY and DISHONESTLY portray republicans as the KKK...

David Duke and Robert Byrd are just a couple examples of modern people who ran as democrats who were both members of the KKK...

Then Bill Clinton honored that democrat KKK motherfucker after he died explaining away Byrds democratic presents in the KKK as "misguided."

You don't know a fucking thing do you??

Nick.....you are a twisted man child. But you know that

You are unable to differentiate Democrats and Republicans from Liberals and Conservatives. You think Republican = Conservative

Here is the way it worked man child. If you were from the south you opposed Civil Rights whether you were Democrat or Republican. Northern Democrats and Northern Republicans supported civil rights.

The Klan was comprised of racists from both the North and the south.

Now....what happened to all those southern Racists that got disgusted with the Democrats for pushing civil rights down their throats? They turned Repoblican 45 years ago and haven't looked back

In what universe do you believe every white person back then viewed blacks as sub human??

You do realize many white families even back then viewed slavery as barbaric and bought them just so they wouldn't be purchased by those with nefarious intent...

My family (moms side) still possesses correspondences between my great-great-great-great grandma that purchased a slave out of contempt for slavery...

I remember exactly some parts of the letter... "it is in my joy that I purchased a negro, and the suffering of that individual has been ceased." and the letter went on to say "I enjoy her company and she is grateful"

Let's start with this one here, Nicklehead:

"Show me some citations where the KKK was EVER controlled by the republican party?"

You see, right there, you make an assertion I never made. Then you ask me to back up something I never said. In even the SAME DAMN POST, I explained to you how the ideology is not the same as the party and co-mingling the two is deceptive.

So, off the bat, you show your debate method is a ruse. You are playing a game, not really debating. So I treat it with the dedication it deserves, that is - none.

And for the record, history is my life's work. I touch it daily. I live history.

Thousands of original civil war letters have passed through my hands, I have had diaries, journals, day books of soldiers and officers...which now reside in the Smithsonian, and in other major and minor museums. I interact regularly with important historical societies and Athenaeums. Often times, they consult me.

I have literally held the documents or letters of most every one of our Founding Fathers, as well as just about every President. (William Henry Harrison has been a tough one!) -
I have had original letters from both Lee and Sherman (and many other Officers). Intense research accompanies this.
I love it.

I swwwwwim in history everyday, every hour, and have for decades now.
My goal is to keep it safe, preserve what memory remains and protect them for future generations.

Imagine what my world is like --touching the same pen, the same paper as Washington or Jefferson or Sherman held. It's magical, I tell you.

I do. It is one of the most rewarding endeavors one can imagine - and I make a living at it! I touch the ancients every day, and have for decades. You have no idea how incredibly awesome and history-filled my life is - and I'll tell you, I''m sure like others, it's pretty damn sickening to hear some random spouting poster tell those whose life it is to study history they don't know what they are talking about.

Yet you still refuse to acknowledge that democrats were the KKK???

Like I said cite evidence that supports your theory they were NOT...

If you're such a historian than you would CLEARLY be on my side..

Not to mention any text that goes through your hands I can read online or just about at any library... So its not exactly like you have exclusive admission to those letters, all of which known have been reilliterated to the general public... We're not talking about the Dead Sea Scrolls here....

Not to mention I highly doubt your bullshit, because if you had the position of handling material you would have a lot more to say than "I handle vintage historical material."

Do you have any idea how many federalists owned slaves???

Besides "owning" is different than employing...

It seems anyone who employed a black individual back then was a slave owner...

You ever think for a second that some individuals treated blacks as employees and NOT slaves??

Not to mention there were plenty of white slaves too.

</quote>

So Jefferson and Madison "employed" slaves now.

In what universe do you believe every white person back then viewed blacks as sub human??

You do realize many white families even back then viewed slavery as barbaric and bought them just so they wouldn't be purchased by those with nefarious intent...

My family (moms side) still possesses correspondences between my great-great-great-great grandma that purchased a slave out of contempt for slavery...

I remember exactly some parts of the letter... "it is in my joy that I purchased a negro, and the suffering of that individual has been ceased." and the letter went on to say "I enjoy her company and she is grateful"

He enjoyed her company and she is grateful?

He bought her so he could fuck her you dolt

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29#History">Democratic Party (United States) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>

"The Democratic Party evolved from Anti-Federalist factions that opposed the fiscal policies of Alexander Hamilton in the early 1790s. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison organized these factions into the Democratic-Republican Party. The party favored states' rights and strict adherence to the Constitution; it opposed a national bank and wealthy, moneyed interests. The Democratic-Republican Party ascended to power in the election of 1800.

"After the War of 1812, the party's chief rival, the Federalist Party disbanded. Democratic-Republicans split over the choice of a successor to President James Monroe, and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, became the Democratic Party."

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29">Republican Party (United States) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>

"Founded in Northern States in 1854 by anti-slavery activists, modernizers, ex-Whigs and ex-Free Soilers, the Republican Party quickly became the principal opposition to the dominant Democratic Party and the briefly popular Know Nothing Party. The main cause was opposition to the KansasNebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise by which slavery was kept out of Kansas. The Republicans saw the expansion of slavery as a great evil. The first public meeting where the name "Republican" was suggested for a new anti-slavery party was held on March 20, 1854 in a schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin."

The Democratic Party, not the Republican Party, is today's name for Jefferson's Democratic-Republican party. The GOP, although not a direct descendant of the Federalists the way the Democrats are of the D-Rs, is an indirect descendant in that many Federalist supporters became Whigs, and most Whig supporters became Republicans.

So you have it one hundred percent backwards. As does Mr. Beck, of course.

By Laura Bassett

WASHINGTON -- Despite recent accusations of racism and homophobia, Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) stuck to his libertarian principles on Sunday, criticizing the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it "undermine[d] the concept of liberty" and "destroyed the principle of private property and private choices."

"If you try to improve relationships by forcing and telling people what they can't do, and you ignore and undermine the principles of liberty, then the government can come into our bedrooms," Paul told Candy Crowley on CNN's "State of the Union." "And that's exactly what has happened. Look at what's happened with the PATRIOT Act. They can come into our houses, our bedrooms our businesses... And it was started back then."

The Civil Rights Act repealed the notorious Jim Crow laws; forced schools, bathrooms and buses to desegregate; and banned employment discrimination. Although Paul was not around to weigh in on the landmark legislation at the time, he had the chance to cast a symbolic vote against it in 2004, when the House of Representatives took up a resolution "recognizing and honoring the 40th anniversary of congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." Paul was the only member who voted " no."

Once again you completely fail to Grasp the Point.

The Point is you can not Legislate Morality, and that giving one group of People special laws and Privileges is Directly contrary to the very Idea of Equal Rights. Affirmative Action, For Example, which we can use to sight many Instances where by following the Law, Employers legally Discriminate against White Candidates in order to fill an Arbitrary Quota of Minorities.

I mean hell I want equal rights for all workers just as much as the next guy, but when a More Qualified Candidate is Rejected in the Favor of a Less Qualified one, Simply because they are white, it's just as bad as when it happens the other way around.

Let's start with this one here, Nicklehead:

You see, right there, you make an assertion I never made. Then you ask me to back up something I never said. In even the SAME DAMN POST, I explained to you how the ideology is not the same as the party and co-mingling the two is deceptive.

So, off the bat, you show your debate method is a ruse. You are playing a game, not really debating. So I treat it with the dedication it deserves, that is - none.

And for the record, history is my life's work. I touch it daily. I live history.

Thousands of original civil war letters have passed through my hands, I have had diaries, journals, day books of soldiers and officers...which now reside in the Smithsonian, and in other major and minor museums. I interact regularly with important historical societies and Athenaeums. Often times, they consult me.

I have literally held the documents or letters of most every one of our Founding Fathers, as well as just about every President. (William Henry Harrison has been a tough one!) -
I have had original letters from both Lee and Sherman (and many other Officers). Intense research accompanies this.
I love it.

I swwwwwim in history everyday, every hour, and have for decades now.
My goal is to keep it safe, preserve what memory remains and protect them for future generations.

The GOP is the party that GOVERNS on legislating morality. Why the fuck do you think that the supposed MORAL Majority played such a big factor in their party?

</quote>

The GOP has long been the party of big government - big moral government and big surveillance government. They want to put big brother's hands in your womb; they want the Fed to track your calls, emails, reading lists, and bank transactions. They are the first to use the Federal Bureaucracy to censor art and entertainment. They want to tell consenting adults who they can marry. They want the state to penetrate every element of the citizens private moral life. They don't trust adults to think for themselves. They want a Big Government bureaucrat at the base of every bed and in the pages of every textbook (so they can make sure none of that devil science contradicts the biblical timeline). They want a medieval christianized public sphere wherein their particular God is shoved down the throats of supposedly free people. They want the biggest, most interventionist state of all. The Bush Patriot Act and Homeland Security gave unprecedented power to the fed to intervene in the life of American citizens. Small government? They have no problem using the federal courts to change the outcomes of presidential elections. But it doesn't stop there. Reagan's War on Drugs and Bush's War on Terror gave the federal government sweeping new powers to intervene in the life and destiny of the states.The only freedoms they protect are those of large corporations. People who believe that GOP cares about freedom and small government are useful idiots. They clearly get all their information from government, i.e., movement conservatism, which moves business profits to think tanks, TV, and radio; from FOX to Rush...

God help us.

Of course democrats were in the Klan, but thats not the issue.

This issue was they were conservatives, advocating the same thing then as conservatives and libertarians do today: the myth of states rights and a repeal of the Civil Rights Act, rejecting its supporting Constitutional case law.

I've heard today's democrats claim that the democrats who fought against the Civil Rights act were really republicans. We all know that's B.S. They were democrats. Democrats still show their racist roots when they get angry. Look the way they treated Dr. Condie Rice with filthy racist cartoons. They never apologized because they didn't have to. Dr. Rice was a republican.

By Laura Bassett

WASHINGTON -- Despite recent accusations of racism and homophobia, Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) stuck to his libertarian principles on Sunday, criticizing the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it "undermine[d] the concept of liberty" and "destroyed the principle of private property and private choices."

"If you try to improve relationships by forcing and telling people what they can't do, and you ignore and undermine the principles of liberty, then the government can come into our bedrooms," Paul told Candy Crowley on CNN's "State of the Union." "And that's exactly what has happened. Look at what's happened with the PATRIOT Act. They can come into our houses, our bedrooms our businesses... And it was started back then."

The Civil Rights Act repealed the notorious Jim Crow laws; forced schools, bathrooms and buses to desegregate; and banned employment discrimination. Although Paul was not around to weigh in on the landmark legislation at the time, he had the chance to cast a symbolic vote against it in 2004, when the House of Representatives took up a resolution "recognizing and honoring the 40th anniversary of congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964." Paul was the only member who voted " no."

One of the most insidious ways right wingers have waged war against minorities is through business.

Yeah--what did anyone expect--it wasn't too long ago that his son--Rand Paul stated that under the constitution and personal property rights--a restaurant owner--if the owner wishes should be able to keep minorities out of his restaurant. Of course he stated he wouldn't do that if he were a restaurant owner--BUT--would not go near forcing others to do so.

<quote>
Paul said he opposes discrimination but has problems with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it bans businesses from discriminating against customers.

Democrat President John F. Kennedy is lauded as a proponent of civil rights. However, Kennedy voted against the 1957 Civil Rights Act while he was a senator, as did Democrat Sen. Al Gore Sr. And after he became President, Kennedy was opposed to the 1963 March on Washington by Dr. King that was organized by A. Phillip Randolph, who was a black Republican. President Kennedy, through his brother Atty. Gen. <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=16500#">Robert Kennedy</a>, had Dr. King wiretapped and investigated by the FBI on suspicion of being a Communist in order to undermine Dr. King.

And this...

On September 30, 1962, riots erupted on the campus of the University of Mississippi in Oxford where locals, students, and committed segregationists had gathered to protest the enrollment of James Meredith, a black Air Force veteran attempting to integrate the all-white school. Despite the presence of more than 120 federal marshals who were on hand to protect Meredith from harm, the crowd turned violent after nightfall, and authorities struggled to maintain order. When the smoke cleared the following morning, two civilians were dead and scores more were reported injured.

For Meredith, the riot was perhaps a fitting coda to a process that began almost two years earlier when he brought suit against the school, alleging that he was denied admission on the basis of race. Although a lower court sided with the university, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit issued a decision in June 1962 ordering the school to admit Meredith the following fall, thereby ensuring a showdown between the federal government and Mississippi's segregationist state government. After spending the night of September 30 under federal protection, Meredith was allowed to register for classes the following morning, and became the first black graduate from the university in August 1963.

Sure there were instances of democrats flipping republican out of spite, however that had nothing to with political ideology and everything to do with some opposing the democrats for using blacks as a political tool rather than continuing to oppress them.

By Laura Bassett

WASHINGTON -- Despite recent accusations of racism and homophobia, Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) stuck to his libertarian principles on Sunday, criticizing the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it "undermine[d] the concept of liberty" and "destroyed the principle of private property and private choices."

"If you try to improve relationships by forcing and telling people what they can't do, and you ignore and undermine the principles of liberty, then the government can come into our bedrooms," Paul told Candy Crowley on CNN's "State of the Union." "And that's exactly what has happened. Look at what's happened with the PATRIOT Act. They can come into our houses, our bedrooms our businesses... And it was started back then."

The Civil Rights Act repealed the notorious Jim Crow laws; forced schools, bathrooms and buses to desegregate; and banned employment discrimination. Although Paul was not around to weigh in on the landmark legislation at the time, he had the chance to cast a symbolic vote against it in 2004, when the House of Representatives took up a resolution "recognizing and honoring the 40th anniversary of congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."

Once again you completely fail to Grasp the Point.

The Point is you can not Legislate Morality, and that giving one group of People special laws and Privileges is Directly contrary to the very Idea of Equal Rights. Affirmative Action, For Example, which we can use to sight many Instances where by following the Law, Employers legally Discriminate against White Candidates in order to fill an Arbitrary Quota of Minorities.

I mean hell I want equal rights for all workers just as much as the next guy, but when a More Qualified Candidate is Rejected in the Favor of a Less Qualified one, Simply because they are white, it's just as bad as when it happens the other way around.

The inability of the lefties to grasp the point is on full display here.

The GOP is the party that GOVERNS on legislating morality. Why the fuck do you think that the supposed MORAL Majority played such a big factor in their party?

</quote>

The GOP has long been the party of big government - big moral government and big surveillance government. They want to put big brother's hands in your womb; they want the Fed to track your calls, emails, reading lists, and bank transactions. They are the first to use the Federal Bureaucracy to censor art and entertainment. They want to tell consenting adults who they can marry. They want the state to penetrate every element of the citizens private moral life. They don't trust adults to think for themselves. They want a Big Government bureaucrat at the base of every bed and in the pages of every textbook (so they can make sure none of that devil science contradicts the biblical timeline). They want a medieval christianized public sphere wherein their particular God is shoved down the throats of supposedly free people. They want the biggest, most interventionist state of all. The Bush Patriot Act and Homeland Security gave unprecedented power to the fed to intervene in the life of American citizens. Small government? They have no problem using the federal courts to change the outcomes of presidential elections. But it doesn't stop there. Reagan's War on Drugs and Bush's War on Terror gave the federal government sweeping new powers to intervene in the life and destiny of the states.The only freedoms they protect are those of large corporations. People who believe that GOP cares about freedom and small government are useful idiots. They clearly get all their information from government, i.e., movement conservatism, which moves business profits to think tanks, TV, and radio; from FOX to Rush...

God help us.

Democrat President John F. Kennedy is lauded as a proponent of civil rights. However, Kennedy voted against the 1957 Civil Rights Act while he was a senator, as did Democrat Sen. Al Gore Sr. And after he became President, Kennedy was opposed to the 1963 March on Washington by Dr. King that was organized by A. Phillip Randolph, who was a black Republican. President Kennedy, through his brother Atty. Gen. <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=16500#">Robert Kennedy</a>, had Dr. King wiretapped and investigated by the FBI on suspicion of being a Communist in order to undermine Dr. King.

The Civil Rights act had two parts: ending government mandated discrimination and segregation (Jim Crow Laws) and mandating intrusive government involvement in business and personal lives to stop personal discrimination.

Ron Paul fully agreed with the former, which pundits and partisans conveniently like to ignore. He disagreed only with the latter. Why? You cannot legislate morality. You cannot stop people from doing drugs by outlawing drugs. You cannot stop people from being racist idiots by outlawing personal discrimination.

If Ron Paul being honest enough to reveal this truth is disgusting and offensive to you people, then you need to wake up and smell the roses because government has no power to make us better people. We have to do that ourselves.

</quote>

So the anti-discrimination laws have not all but ended businesses discriminating against minorities?

</quote>

You bring up a good point that goes back to the heart of the argument. It involves the idea that government can legislate morality effectively. Looking at the drug war, it obviously can't.

What ultimately ended business discrimination was two things:
1. People over time became more tolerable of those different than them. That fact the Civil Rights act even passed is proof that much of this had already occurred not only without government interference but in spite of government interference in the opposite direction (jim crow laws).
2. It is very unprofitable to run a business that prevents large segments of the population from patronizing it. Not only will you lose minority customers' money, you will likely be boycotted by those who are sympathetic with the minorities. This did not happen prior to the Civil Rights Act because laws were on the books that forced segregation.

Today, the result of government intrusion is that in the name of fighting discrimination, all-women gyms are sued and forced to open to men; a gay softball team is sued for rejecting bisexual members; A wedding photographer in New Mexico is fined thousands of dollars for refusing to take photos of a homosexual wedding. (those are all real world examples that have actually happened).

Instead of just eliminating segregation, the Civil Rights Act imposed mandatory association. Ron Paul is right. Neither mandatory segregation, nor mandatory association, is appropriate in a free society.

The case law demonstrates thats clearly not the case.

Your "case law" droning is tedious even when it is applicable. Here it's just pompous blathering.

Perhaps.

But no one cares about my opinion, just as I give no weight or consideration to others subjective opinions. All that matters is the facts of law, regardless how conservatives, libertarians, and other rightists might want it to be.

If you find my citing of case law tedious and pompous, take it up with those who refuse to acknowledge it, and i'll gladly cease.

As I already noted, that after all this time the Act must be defended at all is sad; its also evidence the Act is as much needed today was it was then, if not more so.

Whether a market solution would have worked or not is irrelevant.

As a matter of law segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, and laws authorizing segregation were struck down accordingly. Segregation in public accommodations adversely effected commerce among the states, and Congress is authorized to regulate that activity per the Commerce Clause.

That this is even subject to debate in 2012 is sad and telling.

</quote>

And Ron Paul supported the provisions of the Civil Rights Act that ended Jim Crow laws and the like that forced and encouraged segregation. He supported ending all segregation in public accommodations.

The only people discussing that are dishonest pundits who smear those they fear will change their position in power. What is telling is the complete bias and ignorance of people who take things out of context. That is telling of the lack of honest debate here in this country in 2012.

Just as you cannot stop people from doing drugs by making it illegal, you cannot stop people from being racist by doing so. In fact, just as government laws banning drugs lead to an even worse drug situation, so do laws trying to ban segregation lead to more racial tension.

Ron Paul supported ending all segregation in public laws. He was against provisions of the bill that tried to force people to integrate, which simply cannot be done.

"Federal bureaucrats and judges cannot read minds to see if actions are motivated by racism. Therefore, the only way the federal government could ensure an employer was not violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to ensure that the racial composition of a business's workforce matched the racial composition of a bureaucrat or judge's defined body of potential employees. Thus, bureaucrats began forcing employers to hire by racial quota. Racial quotas have not contributed to racial harmony or advanced the goal of a color-blind society. Instead, these quotas encouraged racial balkanization, and fostered racial strife. Of course, America has made great strides in race relations over the past forty years. However, this progress is due to changes in public attitudes and private efforts. Relations between the races have improved despite, not because of, the 1964 Civil Rights Act."
-Ron Paul

You are ignoring all the negative affects of the civil rights act, such as all women gyms being sued for discriminating against men. In many ways, the Civil Rights Act (minus the end of public segregation and Jim Crow Laws of course) increased racial tensions.

The main problem Ron Paul and people like myself have about the bill is title II, not the whole thing.

Affirmative action was a necessary followup to the civil rights act. As you know, all an employer had to say was....you can change the laws but you can't make me hire one of them nigras
Forced quotas ensured that integration would take place. Initially, if you wanted a government contract, you had to show you did not discriminate
Those quotas have since been relaxed and the results have been more blacks in the workforce, management and formerly all white occupations. Affirmative action worked and the world did not come to an end

I suppose many would sponsor an authoritarian state as long as it was their ideas or morals being enforced...

I would like to say I would never tolerate such nonsense if my "values" were shoved down anothers throat but I'm a libertarian hence it wouldn't make any sense. I would certainly oppose my morals being shoved down anothers throat. People can do what they like as long as it's within the context of the Bill of Rights....

What does Walter Williams think of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? By the way, Walter Williams is black. So surely he must disagree with Ron Paul, right?

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqod16fhMPE">Walter E Williams - Discrimination and Liberty - YouTube</a>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqod16fhMPE"> Walter E Williams - Discrimination and Liberty - YouTube</a>

Nope. He agrees completely with Ron Paul. For those who do not watch the video, he says "Title II of the Civil Rights Act is unconstitutional."

"The true commitment, or the test of one's commitment to freedom of association, doesn't come when he allows people to be free to associate in the manner in which he deems ok. The true test of one's commitment to freedom of association is when you allow people to associate in ways you find offensive, that﻿ you find personally offensive."

I don't bring in the opinion of a black economist because I think the fact that he is black automatically makes him an expert on civil rights. I bring his opinion in to try and knock some sense in to many of you on this board that equate opposition to the civil rights act to racism.

One final bit of food for thought: Are there laws outlawing customers from discriminating against employers? No. Not a single one. But do you see white people refusing to go to establishments run by black people because the law does not force them to go there? Again, no. That is evidence enough that you don't need government to outlaw discrimination that is harmful to society.

I've met gay tea party members and they were normal people - those flamboyant loud mouthed YMCA fools are anything but normal...

I had to work with one of those idiots who was "openly gay" and this idiot was so open he constantly talked about his sexual encounters loudly and "proudly" at the work place...

The idiot only kept his job because management was too scared to fire his ass out of worries of a lawsuit..

NO company should have to worry about firing a belligerent assclown out of fear of a lawsuit.

If I talked the way he did about my personal life I would have been shit canned in two seconds - but he was gay and he gets protection because of that??

The only problem he had with the act is that private businesses could no longer discriminate based on race. He believes businesses should be allowed to refuse service or employment to anyone.

That's it. He never said anything about special rights or whatever, and his stance on the act does not make him a racist.

Which government state or federal??

Federal government - to protect us from foreign threats...

State governments - to govern how the people see fit....

If you want to live in a welfare state that is governed by lunatic progressives then fine - that is your choice, but I will chose to live in a state where the government doesn't shove tomatoes down my throat and that grants me the liberties to govern over myself - to make my own decisions.

I'm not a racist, I just just believe that the government has no right telling others what they need to do.

Business owners have the right to hire whoever they like and for whatever reason... If you believe a business is racist then don't buy their product or service and buy from another you feel more comfortable with.

The notion that the government can just tell someone or a business what to do is exactly whats wrong with this country.

You bring up a good point that goes back to the heart of the argument. It involves the idea that government can legislate morality effectively. Looking at the drug war, it obviously can't

</quote>

I have to disagree with you here. We can legislate quite a bit with a strong enough police state. The question is, should we? Do we want government deciding for us what is moral and then forcing us to comply?

</quote>

You know, on second thought, there is one sense in which I agree with the notion that "you can't legislate morality". And it has nothing to do with the practical challenges.

Moral accountability depends on freedom. You can't hold someone moral responsible for an action if they had no choice in the matter. When we coerce specific actions via force of law, the morality is removed from the equation. At that point, its just a question of following orders.

From that perspective, you can't create a moral society by passing laws. The best you can do is create one that does dutifully follows orders and is, arguably, less moral.

And how did you get to thinking that? Because he's not.

This is how demagoguery works. People, usually inspired by a sound bite and little else, let their imaginations run wild.

One of Ron Paul's key faults as a politician is that he doesn't respect demagoguery. Most other politicians learn to never say anything that can be construed to actually mean anything. The never explain their views, never indulge any detailed discussion of their political philosophy or convictions. They just spew empty platitudes that have been time-tested against distortion.

Ron Paul isn't railing against the Civil Rights Act. He is questioning the precedent that our government should be so involved in day-to-day business decisions. It's still an open debate, still an important issue that is raised in more and more laws currently under consideration. Which means, of course, he should have never brought it up. He should have stuck with some thing simple and digestible. Truth, justice and the American way!

The fact that Ron Paul does bring it up is on of the reasons I like him. He isn't hiding his stance and he isn't trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator. He is trying to raise the level of conversation. This issue is really about liberals trying to shame people into ignoring his real message by obfuscating the facts with emotional grandstanding. This is a debate about the powers of the federal government not about who should be equal. Anyone who ignores that fact and attempts to pull the race card on this issue is being deliberately dishonest or they are egregiously misinformed.

Actually, RW, as a point of constitutional law you're not correct. Neither is the guy you responded to.

The federal government's purpose is to exercise those powers delegated to the Congress in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. That does NOT include "doing anything it wants in service to the common defense and general welfare." That phrase is a modifier on the taxation/spending power, not a separate power on its own.

The states have all powers normally exercised by governments, except those delegated to the federal government and those explicitly forbidden to the states by either their own constitutions or the U.S. Constitution. Unlike the federal government, state governments are not limited to enumerated powers.

So in a way, you have it exactly backwards.

He's actually in favor of Civil Rights. His issue with the Civil Rights Act was the portion that granted government the power to interfere with personal decisions. He believes (and I agree with him) that the state telling us who we must associate with, who we must do business with, who we can hire or fire (and for what reasons) is unnecessary to achieve equal protection.

Be that as it may if you actually left this up to the people, big parts of the country would still have segregation, especially here in the South. I just can't support that, the only way civil rights were enforced was by force, not because people wanted them. I am half Black and I will stand to lose alot if Civil rights are taken away.

The Civil Rights Act of 1965 made the US a truly great nation.

Up until that time, we claimed to be a great nation but lacked a moral compass. Any nation that denies a significant part of their population basic liberty and freedom because they do not like their color is not a great nation.

For Ron Paul to seek to deny people the right to attend the college of their choice, eat at a public lunch counter, be seated in a restaurant, swim in a public pool or stay in a hotel solely because some racists believe them to be subhuman shows why Paul is unfit to be President

So Ron Paul is ok with segregation, but wants to legalize drugs? oh boy. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

No he's not ok with segregation.

It's the same tired old act Obamabots use when they say being against welfare means you want poor people to stay poor forever, if you're against Obamacare you want all sick/poor people to die, if you're against Social Security you want all old people to go broke, etc etc.

Same tired old act, having nothing to do with intellect, everything to do with grabbing at emotions and fearmongering.

Ron Paul is perfectly fine with segregation as long as the government is not doing it

You want to make deny blacks the use of your restrooms, that is your right. You own a hotel and don't want coloreds using your swimming pool, that is your right
You want to make coloreds eat around back, that is your right

That is Ron Paul's vision of America

No, it's people who have more faith in gov't than americans who think we have to have gov't to keep americans from segregating.

When you take the emotion out of it you realize all those businesses would be out of business in 2 seconds thanks to the american ppl and not gov't.

Ron Paul clearly hates blacks, as evidence of all the free healthcare he gave to minorities. I can only imagine how much money Obama has given to minorities out of his pocket to pay their healthcare expenses. It's probably in the billions of dollars.

This sums it up perfectly for Paul. He actually believes businesses will "do the right thing". I have been to some interesting places all over the country and believe me, if there were no law, they would not "do the right thing" when pertaining to civil rights.

Dr. Paul, it is not 1961. Please America, do not allow this man to get close to the white house. It is a scary thought.

Bullshit. I drove across the country twice and have stopped at some small towns who's demographics where pretty much the same. All white. In those towns, if they had signs that said no blacks served, they would be "out of business in 2 seconds"?

Here is a hint, Americans would not do the right thing if they didnt have to. Laws are in place for a reason and its juvenile and just dumb to think otherwise.

So instead no one knows who the racist business owners are, and blacks are unknowingly lining racists pockets with their money.

Ok 99% of the businesses would go under either from lack of business, bad pub and people rightfully protesting these places and racist customers not wanting to deal with it.

We wouldn't be a more racist nation if it weren't for almighty gov't, i'll take the character of americans of the character of gov't politicians and bureacrats every single day of the week/year/milennium.

So if the Civil Rights Act had never been passed the only stores you'd see would be an occasional tiny store that didn't serve blacks, and this would benefit blacks in one way and that's the instance of them being able to take their business elsewhere.

Without the full Civil Rights bill those businesses would be business as usual, colored come around the back. That is the world as Ron Paul sees it

After the civil war, those businesses had 100 years to do the right thing and allow full access to all. The local community had 100 years to force business to treat all customers with respect. They were perfectly fine with their peculiar institution.

It was the government forcing business to accept all customers that broke the peculiar institution. Within five years of the Civil Rights bill, everyone accepted integration and it was no big deal.

It wouldnt have happened if Ron Paul was calling the shots

According to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ext/share.php?sid=229555165146&amp;h=Xyu5g&amp;u=CmwD5&amp;ref=nf">the NBC affliate in Philadelphia</a>, the <a href="http://www.thevalleyclub.com/">Valley Swim Club</a> booted a day camp of inner city kids— which had paid $1900 for summer swimming rights —after members refused to swim with black kids. Really. "I heard this lady, she was like, 'Uh, what are all these black kids doing here?' She's like, 'I'm scared they might do something to my child,'" said camper Dymire Baylor....

"When the minority children got in the pool all of the Caucasian children immediately exited the pool," <a href="http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/topics?topic=Horace+Gibson">Horace Gibson</a>, parent of a day camp child, wrote in an email.

"The pool attendants came and told the black children that they did not allow minorities in the club and needed the children to leave immediately."

The next day the club told the camp director that the camp's membership was being suspended and their money would be refunded....

The explanation they got was either dishearteningly honest or poorly worded.

"There was concern that a lot of kids would change the complexion … and the atmosphere of the club," <a href="http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/topics?topic=John+Duesler">John Duesler</a>, President of The Valley Swim Club said in a statement.

Looking at it from today's perspective it is easy to say "America is not like that, we would have desegregated on our own"

Looking at it from a 1960s perspective, we had maintained a states rights enforced segregation for 100 years. We had communities burning churches, lynching blacks, spitting on children.....all to maintain their cherished segregation

As I said above, I understand where Paul is coming from -- not racism, but a belief in an absolute right of a business owner to conduct his business as he chooses, regardless of any other considerations -- but I disagree. I disagree not merely on this point, but in general.

A business cannot be treated like private behavior in the home, because it has great impact on other people: employees, customers, the community. It is for that reason perfectly sound to apply greater obligations and restrictions to business behavior than we do to private behavior in the home. And there is a graduation of obligation depending on the nature and size of the business

If I'm baking bread just for myself and my family, I can do it any way I want. If I'm baking it for sale, though, I have to meet reasonable health-code restrictions and disclose my ingredients.

If I'm the only person working in my business, then I can oppress and exploit my sole employee (myself) anyway I want -- expect long hours, low (or no) pay, etc. But if my business is the source of someone else's livelihood, that creates an obligation towards my employee that doesn't exist if I have none.

Et cetera. Your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins. And a business inherently has a long arm.

Why are people acting like Paul wants mandated segregation? He thinks that if a racist bar owner wants to refuse to serve blacks (or whites, or Asians), they should be allowed to do so.

so I'm driving cross country and I run out of gas and the only gas stations next to me are white only gas stations in rural Arkansas, I am fucked yeah? I can understand why some white people can shrug this off and not care, but I am half Black, if you were in my shoes you would view civil rights completely different.

Burning churches was illegal then, lynching blacks was illegal then, spitting on children racists will still do.

Agree to disagree, as I do with most liberal emotion based stances on political issues.

Those committing those acts were the same community that you claim would have graciously accepted integration without the Civil Rights bill

And those same racist assholes who happened to own businesses probably became rich from the added business that blacks gave them.

Blacks giving money to racists, hooray government.

If these racist guys are making alot of cash from Blacks, they won't want to segregate their businesses anyways.

Bullshit. I drove across the country twice and have stopped at some small towns who's demographics where pretty much the same. All white. In those towns, if they had signs that said no blacks served, they would be "out of business in 2 seconds"?

Here is a hint, Americans would not do the right thing if they didnt have to. Laws are in place for a reason and its juvenile and just dumb to think otherwise.

Businesses can serve whoever the fuck they want...

One time I wasn't dressed correctly and I was refused entry into a fucking club - is that discrimination??

Slobs are not a protected class

I wasn't wearing a button up dress shirt.... I was wearing a golf shirt...

Hardly slobbish.........

However even If I was "dressed as a slob" using your fucking pathetic logic it would be discrimination no???

I don't particularly care for dress codes, if it were up to me I would do away with them, if you want to dress in a clown suit and go to a night club, more power to you.

Ron Paul's stance on this issue is that you cannot legislate morality, and by giving special privileges or entitlements to one group you strip the rights of another.

P.S. Your a partisan shitstain on the clean white undies of the United States. Go fuck yourself you do nothing liberal. All you and your party can do is bitch and complain while holding your hand out expecting others to provide for you.

</quote>

NO WAY YOU JUST SAID THAT. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/> That is so full of shit. What about the GOP's war on abortion rights? Euthanasia? Marijuana use?

The GOP is the party that GOVERNS on legislating morality. Why the fuck do you think that the supposed MORAL Majority played such a big factor in their party?

</quote>

I agree. But Ron Paul is a Republican in name only and running as one only out of necessity. He would agree with you on all of those things. It doesn't matter if it comes from the right or the left. It isn't the government's job to legislate morality.

The same can happen the other way, what if you are white and your car breaks down in a mainly Hispanic part of Arizona or New Mexico, and all the garages there are Hispanic only?

I would think at a "fucking club" you wouldn't have to wear any attire at all.

</quote>

Are you kidding me??

Some clubs have strict dress codes..

I'm not much of a club goer these days, however back in my early 20's I did.

Some clubs require formal wear, however others wont let you in if you're too dressed up..... One may as well bring three outfits with them if they want to go club hopping in Chicago. That and about 500 bucks to cover the cost of their 7 dollar beers and 15 dollar shots.

You know what tho?? the owner has every right to expect a standard in their joint... I think some clubs take it too far but guess what?? its not my club and the owners can do whatever the fuck they want...

You mean if 'I' were the one being denied service. You could be denied service for any number of reasons. It doesn't just have to be skin color. If there was one group of people I would consider refusing service to, it would hippies. The reason it's a non-issue, is because it doesn't make sense from a business stand point. That's the second problem with the civil rights act. 1) It indeed does grant rights at the expense of others and 2) it doesn't make any logical sense anyway. From both a right to have service and right to have someone employ it doesn't make any sense for a company to deny anyone solely on that basis in the first place. It's in a companies best interest to hire the best person for the job, regardless of race. And it's in a company's best interest to serve and earn money from anyone they can regardless of race. The racists are gonna reap what the sew eventually, don't worry about that. But not supporting the civil rights act does not make Paul a racist.

I'm sorry I just completely disagree, maybe if you were a minority who was discriminated against in the past you would see things differently. Now I am not old enough to have been through the Civil rights era but I live in Birmingham Alabama and there is alot of history here on this subject, I have been to the Black History museum and seen the difference between white only restrooms, classrooms, business and the black ones, and that is definently NOT something I want to ever experience.

I agree with you that some of the dress codes are too strict, alot of these clubs have these strict dress codes and forbid people from wearing a certain brand of clothing and shoes because they want to keep a certain type of person out, when I was stationed in Nebraska quite a few clubs forbid brands like Southpole, Zoo York, Gucci etc and completely banned Timberlands, they were doing this to try and keep young blacks from going in. They also didn't serve liquor that Blacks were known to request, like Hennessy, thats what pissed me off the most. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/mad.gif"/>

I don't see any difference...

However I don't see why an establishment owner would turn away a paying customer based on race...

I suppose I could see gangbangers turned away (most of which are minorities) because they cause problems, however not some regular black dude..

I guess my point is that I would find it odd that someone would refuse to serve a person based on race these days... However as a libertarian the would have every right to refuse to serve a minority...

I'm not saying I would support such nonsense I'm just saying I respect the liberty of a business owner to deny service, because its their establishment hence they can serve who they want.. Being served isn't a "right."

However, like I previously stated one would have to be retarded to turn down a paying customer over trivial shit like race.....

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese company leading the market for tomato products in Kazakhstan says it
has found a great advantage by pursuing a policy of staff localization.
</P>
<P>
Tomatoes are popular in Kazakstan, and the Tsinkaz Tomato Products Factory holds
the largest market share for tomato products in the country.
</P>
<P>
Its factory in the suburb of Almaty, one of the largest cities in Kazakhstan,
has fine-tuned work procedures, first-class equipment, and, more importantly,
professional local staff.
</P>
<P>
More than 130 of the 140 staff members at the factory are local hires, bringing
the level of staff localization to an amazing 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This is our biggest secret," says Zhang Yanqiu, the smiling general manager of
the factory. "High level of localization brings about great convenience in
research and development and market promotion."
</P>
<P>
Selling tomato products in Kazakhstan is like selling roast ducks in Beijing. It
is a competitive market.
</P>
<P>
Tsinkaz's sales director, who gave his name as Romanai, said the company invited
people to taste tests every time it developed a new product and followed up on
those efforts with surveys in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
Romanai said many of the company's management staff are from the local food
industry and their opinions on the tastes, packaging and choices of materials
matter for the company.
</P>
<P>
The workers help make the company's products as close to the needs of local
customers as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I see people at one whack buy a dozen bottles of ketchup, all
Tsinkaz's products, I am very happy," Romanai said.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1998, Tsinkaz now offers a complete line of more than 50
products. It has sold 40,000 tons of tomato products and has contributed nearly
7 million U.S. dollars in taxes to Kazakhstan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Local employees said they enjoy working at the company.
</P>
<P>
"I have been working in Tsinkaz for more than 10 years, I love my company!" says
an employee named Gulinara.
</P>
<P>
Tsinkaz provides dormitories and lunch for free to all employees, hands out
birthday cakes and presents, organizes celebrations for major holidays and
offers timely bereavement leaves and consolation payments.
</P>
<P>
It also has been actively involved in social events and has donated to help
schools, war veterans and the disabled. The Almaty mayor praised thye company in
2001 for its "important contribution to the development of light industries."
</P>
<P>
The company was recognized as the country's Best Enterprises in Tomato Product
Industry in 10 Years in 2009.

PETA protests against KFC in Damascus

DAMASCUS, July 22 (Xinhua)

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), an animal
rights group, carried out a protest against the fast-food chain Kentucky Fried
Chicken (KFC) in the Syrian capital of Damascus on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PETA activists condemned the KFC's way of treating birds, urging the U.S.
fast-food chain to provide chicken with safer conditions.
</P>
<P>
"KFC suppliers cram birds into huge waste-filled factories, breed and drug them
to grow so large that they can't even walk, and often break their wings and
legs," PETA's activist Jason Baker told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We demand the company to take steps to eliminate these abuses and to adapt
animals welfare standards," Baiker said.
</P>
<P>
PETA is the largest animal rights group in the world. Last June, the group
condemned U.S. President Barack Obama's ninja-like killing of a fly during an
interview with CNBC, requesting the President to show a bit more restraint next
time he encounters a fly.

act"

<TEXT>
<P>
Somalia on Monday strongly condemned the twin blasts in Ugandan capital Kampala,
terming it as "evil act".
</P>
<P>
Two bomb explosions rocked Kampala late on Sunday, killing at least 64 people
and injuring many others.
</P>
<P>
Somalian President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said in a statement that the blasts
occurred as the victims were watching the World  Cup Final, reveling the evil
and ugly nature of the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
It  also demonstrated the need to uproot those who do not value the sanctity of
the human life, the Somali president said.
</P>
<P>
The act of terrorism would only boost the strong ties between the peoples of
somalia and Uganda, the president added.

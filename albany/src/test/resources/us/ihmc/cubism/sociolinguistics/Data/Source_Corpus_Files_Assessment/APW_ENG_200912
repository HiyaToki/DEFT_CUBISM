Sylla says Tag Heuer has great respect for Woods' performance in the sport
</P>
<P>
She spoke a day after global consulting firm Accenture Ltd. became the first major sponsor to announce it was cutting ties with Woods.

Swiss wunderkind Gian-Luca Cavigelli dominated the snowboard big air competition in Seoul on Sunday to win his first World Cup title.
</P>
<P>
He shut out Austria's Stefan Gimpl, who finished a close second with two strong runs, followed by Finland's Markku Koski in third.
</P>
<P>
Gimpl and Cavigelli have gone head-to-head in World Cup big air competitions all season, with Gimpl edging ahead three times and claiming victory in London, Barcelona and Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
But the Seoul contest was Cavigelli's domain. The 22-year-old Swiss set the pace with a big backside 1080 -- three rotations in the air -- that went unmatched throughout the competition.
</P>
<P>
The rising star put together three huge, clean jumps that had the crowd roaring.
</P>
<P>
Gimpl put the pressure on Cavigelli with a high-scoring opening jump but touched his hand down on his second. He came back with a strong third run and clean landing to secure the silver.
</P>
<P>
Koski, the gold medalist in the snowboard world championships earlier this year, showed his competitive mettle by coming back from a faltering first run with two skillful jumps.
</P>
<P>
Cavigelli said he was relaxed, especially after nailing the first jump, but was excited to have a World Cup title.
</P>
<P>
"I feel great at the moment to have won my first World Cup -- it's a super great feeling, super special city, and it's the best," Cavigelli said.
</P>
<P>
Gimpl said he was pleased with his finish.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for Gian-Luca; he has been second for quite a few events now and finally he made it and it was just a good show, good event," he said. "I'm stoked."
</P>
<P>
The finish keeps Gimpl, 30, at the top of the World Cup standings, with 3,800 points. Cavigelli is in second with 3,100 points, and Japan's Kazuhiro Kokubo is third with 1,600 points.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's competition in the heart of the South Korean capital was the first FIS World Cup event held in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The 112-foot-tall (34-meter-tall) ramp in Gwanghwamun Plaza in downtown Seoul was flanked by the 600-year-old Gyeongbok Palace to the back and a statue of the 15th-century ruler King Sejong to the front.
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing, so many people and just a special place. I'm really happy to have won here because it's like a new feeling competing in an Asian country, and definitely Seoul is an amazing city," Cavigelli said.
</P>
<P>
Riders also competed for cash prizes Saturday at the Seoul Snow Jam contest before a crowd of 15,000. Finland's Eero Ettala grabbed the top prize of $24,000 by nailing a switch double back flip in the finals and relegating Gimpl to second place.
</P>
<P>
Ettala, a veteran big air competitor, said he was pleased with his performance before the crowd of 15,000 and was happy he stuck the double flip.
</P>
<P>
"I just kind of went for it. I had the feeling that I needed to do something like that to stay on top, so I'm glad it worked out," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which is bidding to host the 2018 Winter Olympics, also hosted the snowboarding worlds in January.
</P>
<P>
The next World Cup event begins Tuesday in Telluride, Colorado, with parallel GS races that will serve as key Olympic qualifiers.

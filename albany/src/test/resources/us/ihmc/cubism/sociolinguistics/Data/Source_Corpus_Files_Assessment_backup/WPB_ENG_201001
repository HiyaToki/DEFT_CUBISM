<P>
Sun Microsystems Chairman Scott McNealy, in a final memo to employees as the
company prepares to be acquired, said he has "few regrets" about how the fourth-
largest maker of computer servers conducted business.
</P>
<P>
"Sun did not cheat, lie, or break the rule of law or decency," McNealy wrote
Tuesday. "While we enjoyed breaking the rules of conventional wisdom and archaic
business practice and for sure loved to win in the market, we did so with a
solid reputation for integrity."
</P>
<P>
McNealy, 55, sent his memo to employees of the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company
as he readies a handover to Oracle Corp. After Oracle agreed in April to buy Sun
for $7.4 billion, the purchase was delayed as European regulators investigated
the transaction. Oracle received approval from the European Commission last
week, removing one of the deal's last hurdles.
</P>
<P>
"While it was never the primary vision to be acquired by Oracle, it was always
an interesting option," McNealy said in the note, which thanked employees for "a
great 28 years."
</P>
<P>
Oracle has acquired about 60 companies since January 2005. The $9.50-a-share
purchase of Sun is Oracle's first outside the software market.
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, this is not a note this founder wants to write," McNealy said in
the memo. "Sun in my mind should have been the great and surviving consolidator.
But I love the market economy and capitalism more than I love my company."
</P>
<P>
Sun's top executives, including McNealy, Chief Executive Officer Jonathan
Schwartz and Chief Financial Officer Mike Lehman, won't be offered positions at
Oracle, people familiar with the matter said.
</P>
<P>
The executives won't resign because they would forfeit severance packages that
are triggered by the sale, said one person, who declined to be identified
because the plans aren't public.
</P>
<P>
Schwartz is set to receive $12 million as part of his severance package, McNealy
will get $9.53 million and Lehman is due $4.03 million, Sun said in a June 8
regulatory filing. Those sums didn't include performance-based restricted stock,
which Sun said it wasn't able to value at the time.
</P>
<P>
McNealy co-founded the company in 1982 and was CEO from December 1984 to April
2006. He then handed the job to Schwartz, 44, at a time when Sun was trying to
recover from five years of losses.

Strident Tone From China Raises Concerns in West
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

LA TIMES-WASHINGTON POST--01-30-10 2136ET
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's indignant reaction to the announcement of U.S. plans to sell weapons to
Taiwan appears to be in keeping with a new triumphalist attitude from Beijing
that is worrying governments and analysts across the globe.
</P>
<P>
From the Copenhagen climate change conference to Internet freedom to China's
border with India, China observers have noticed a tough tone emanating from its
government, its representatives and influential analysts from its state-funded
think tanks.
</P>
<P>
Calling in U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman on Saturday, Chinese Vice Foreign
Minister He Yafei said the United States would be responsible for "serious
repercussions" if it did not reverse the decision to sell Taiwan $6.4 billion
worth of helicopters, Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missiles, minesweepers and
communications gear. The reaction came even though China has known for months
about the planned deal, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a change in China's attitude," said Kenneth Lieberthal, a former
senior National Security Council official who is currently at the Brookings
Institution. "The Chinese find with startling speed that people have come to
view them as a major global player. And that has fed a sense of confidence."
</P>
<P>
Lieberthal said another factor in China's new tone is a sense that after two
centuries of exploitation by the West, China is resuming its role as one of the
great nations of the world.
</P>
<P>
This new posture has befuddled Western officials and analysts: Is it just
China's tone that is changing or are its policies changing as well?
</P>
<P>
In a case in point, one senior U.S. official termed as unusual China's behavior
at the December climate conference, during which China publicly reprimanded
White House envoy Todd Stern, dispatched a Foreign Ministry functionary to an
event for state leaders and fought strenuously against fixed targets for
emission cuts in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
Another issue is Internet freedom and cybersecurity, highlighted by Google's
recent threat to leave China unless the country stops its Web censorship. At
China's request, that topic was left off the table at this year's World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Josef Ackermann, chief executive of Deutsche Bank
and co-chairman of the event, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say a combination of hubris and insecurity appears to be driving
China's mood. On one hand, Beijing thinks that the relative ease with which it
skated over the global financial crisis underscores the superiority of its
system and that China is not only rising but has arrived on the global stage _
much faster than anyone could have predicted. On the other, recent uprisings in
the western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang have fed Chinese leaders' insecurity
about their one-party state. As such, any perceived threat to their power is met
with a backlash.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said China's tone had not
changed.
</P>
<P>
"China's positions on issues like arms sales to Taiwan and Tibet have been
consistent and clear," Wang Baodong said, "as these issues bear on sovereignty
and territorial integrity, which are closely related to Chinese core national
interests."
</P>
<P>
The unease over China's new tone is shared by Europeans as well. "How Should
Europe Respond to China's Strident Rise?" is the title of a new paper from the
Center for European Reform. Just two years earlier, its author, institute
director Charles Grant, had predicted that China and the European Union would
shape the new world order.
</P>
<P>
"There is a real rethink going on about China in Europe," Grant said in an
interview from Davos. "I don't think governments know what to do, but they know
that their policies aren't working."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials first began noticing the new Chinese attitude last year.
Anecdotes range from the political to the personal.
</P>
<P>
At the World Economic Forum last year, Premier Wen Jiabao lambasted the United
States for its economic mismanagement. A few weeks later, China's central bank
questioned whether the dollar could continue to play its role as the
international reserve currency.
</P>
<P>
And in another vignette, confirmed by several sources, a senior U.S. official
involved in the economy hosted his Chinese counterpart, who then made a series
of disparaging remarks about the bureau that the American ran. Later that night,
the two were to dine at the American's house. The Chinese representatives called
ahead, asking what was for dinner. They were informed that it was fish. "The
director doesn't eat fish," one of them told his American interlocutor. "He
wants steak. He says fish makes you weak." The menu was changed.
</P>
<P>
With Europe and India, China's strident tone has been even more apparent. In
autumn 2008, China canceled a summit with the European Union after French
President Nicolas Sarkozy met with the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama.
Before that, it had denounced German Chancellor Angela Merkel over her contacts
with the Tibetan spiritual leader. And in recent weeks, it has engaged in a
heated exchange with British officials over its moves to block a broader
agreement at the climate conference.
</P>
<P>
At the Chinese Embassy, Wang differed on the climate issue. "China is strongly
behind the idea of meeting the issue of climate change," he said, "but at the
same time we think that there are some people who want to confuse the situation,
and we feel the need to try to let the rest of the world know our position
clearly."
</P>
<P>
China also suspended ties with Denmark after its prime minister met the Dalai
Lama and resumed them only after the Danish government issued a statement in
December saying it would oppose Tibetan independence and consider Beijing's
reaction before inviting him again.
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans have competed to be China's favored friend," Grant said, "but
then they get put in the doghouse one by one."
</P>
<P>
China's newfound toughness also played out in a renewed dispute with India over
Beijing's claims to the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which borders Tibet.
Last summer, China blocked the Asian Development Bank from making a $60 million
loan for infrastructure improvements in the state. India then moved to fund the
projects itself, prompting China to send more troops to the border.
</P>
<P>
David Finkelstein, a former U.S. Army officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency
who now runs the China program at the Center for Naval Analyses, said the new
tone underscores a shift in China. "On the external front," he said, "we will
likely see a China that is more willing than in the past to proactively shape
the external environment and international order rather than passively react to
it."
</P>
<P>
Whether this new bluster from Beijing presages tougher policies and actions in
areas of direct concern to the United States is a key question, Lieberthal said.
Even before the United States announced its plans Friday, at least six senior
Chinese officials, including officers from the People's Liberation Army, had
warned Washington against the sale.
</P>
<P>
Once the deal was announced, China's Defense Ministry said it was suspending a
portion of the recently resumed military relations with the United States. China
also announced that it would sanction the U.S. companies involved in the sale.
</P>
<P>
What happens next will be crucial. China quietly sanctioned several U.S.
companies for participating in such weapons sales in the past. However, it would
mark a major change if China makes the list public and includes, for example,
Boeing, which sells billions of dollars worth of airplanes to China each year.

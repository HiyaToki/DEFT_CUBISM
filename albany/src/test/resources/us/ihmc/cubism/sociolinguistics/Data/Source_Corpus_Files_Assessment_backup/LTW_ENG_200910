Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood Is Knocking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood, the most potent opposition group
in the country. Hundreds of its members are in prison and many more are
lying low. But even as security forces scour the nation for dissent, the
Brotherhood is everywhere, from the shacks of handymen to the estates of
millionaires and the halls of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government of President Hosni Mubarak paints the Brotherhood as an
extremist organization with terrorist ties and a determination to impose
strict Islamic law across Egypt. The group says it renounced violence
decades ago and its real threat to the ruling party is its appeal to the
educated and middle class, who view the regime as corrupt and beholden to
the West. Although there are radicals among its members, the Brotherhood
espouses a moderate Islam to reshape Middle East politics.
</P>
<P>
That is a challenge for Washington. Egypt is a trusted U.S. ally that
has kept peace with Israel for 30 years. A rise in power by the Brotherhood,
which supports armed resistance against the Jewish state, would upset that
balance. The group also could instigate unrest and damage prospects for a
smooth government transition after the 81-year-old Mubarak dies or steps
down.
</P>
<P>
But Egypt's repression of the Brotherhood and other opposition groups
weakens the Obama administration's credibility in the region. Washington has
stressed wider political freedoms in Egypt but, wary of the Brotherhood's
intentions, has not harshly criticized Mubarak for his country's poor human
rights record.
</P>
<P>
"Belonging to the Brotherhood is a state of faith," said Rizk, an
official with the Egyptian Doctors Union. "You help people when you become a
devout Muslim, and that helps the country. Government pressure depressed and
scared away many of our members. But most of us stayed.
</P>
<P>
"When I started with the Brotherhood back in college, you could easily
count us," he added. "Now we have hundreds of thousands of supporters."
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood is facing growing pressure from within and without.
About 400 of its members, including several top figures, have been arrested
in the latest crackdown. The organization is contending with internal
divisions between conservatives and reformers and between those who support
the Brotherhood's political ambitions and those who argue it should return
to its roots as a religious and social movement.
</P>
<P>
The recent arrests appear to be a move by the ruling National Democratic
Party to weaken the group ahead of 2010 parliamentary elections. Members of
the Brotherhood, which is officially banned, ran as independents in 2005 and
won 20 percent of the seats in parliament. Another strong showing next year
could complicate what analysts believe is the National Democratic Party's
plan to have Mubarak's largely untested son Gamal succeed his
father.
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood is working with other groups to block the succession.
The organization says it does not want to govern Egypt, but its street
popularity gives it leverage secular opposition groups lack.
</P>
<P>
"I would not be exaggerating to say that Gamal Mubarak's succession to
power will not take place without brokering a deal with the Muslim
Brotherhood, allowing them to participate in political life and granting
Gamal the popular cover he urgently needs," Khalil Anani, an expert on
political Islam, wrote recently in the Daily News Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Some believe the recent purge is retaliation for the group's support of
the Islamic militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip. During the Israeli
offensive in Gaza last winter, the Brotherhood condemned the Mubarak
government for doing little to protect Palestinians. The criticism damaged
Mubarak's standing and affirmed in the mind of the government that the
group, which was banned in the 1950s after an assassination attempt by its
militant wing, has links to radical Islamic movements that can endanger
regional stability.
</P>
<P>
"We have been effectively supporting our Palestinian brothers,
especially since the Israeli attacks on Gaza," said Mohammed Mahdi Akef, the
Brotherhood's supreme leader. "That has angered many powers in and outside
Egypt, and since then the government started detaining large numbers of our
members and middle management figures. The regime was pressured by many
powers in the West to do so."
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood's larger challenges are domestic political aspirations
and its lack of vision. It does poor public relations, often sending out
muddled messages. Its rigid ideology limits freedom of expression and
women's rights, and the group is against allowing a Christian to ever serve
as president of Egypt. Critics say the Brotherhood doesn't exactly know what
it wants to be at a time Egyptians are looking for an inspiring alternative
to the 28 years of Mubarak's rule.
</P>
<P>
"People expect them to force a change in the Egyptian political
climate," said Abdelmonem Mahmoud, a journalist and blogger who spent months
in prison for leading student protests for the Brotherhood. "But I think
they should abandon their political agenda. They have no clear strategies
for the political future of the country. They'll raise people's hope, but
eventually they'll disappoint their followers."
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood does speak to the religious devotion that has been
intensifying in Egypt since the 1990s. Its challenge, however, is finding a
mix of religion and politics that will fit into the mainstream. That has
been a problem since the group was founded in 1928 by a teacher who wanted
to impose the Quran on all aspects of Egyptian life.
</P>
<P>
"We're not looking for power. We want to reform the country," said Essam
Erian, a leading Brotherhood reformer who spent years in jail.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is the best place to build an Islamic democracy because we're
moderate," he said. "But the West still stereotypes and is afraid of Islam,
and the (Mubarak) regime has convinced the West that dictatorship is better
than Islamic democracy."

<P>
Portugal would take over two Syrian prisoners from the U.S. military prison in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for humanitarian reasons, the Portuguese Foreign Ministry
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Internal Administration
confirm the decision of the Portuguese government to host in Portugal two Syrian
citizens imprisoned in Guantanamo," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement,
without giving more details about the prisoners' identities.
</P>
<P>
Portugal was the first country from the European Union to approve hosting
prisoners from Guantanamo for humanitarian reasons, to support U.S. President
Barack Obama's decision to close that prison in January 2010. France and Ireland
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
The legal status to be given to the two prisoners would be according to Article
68 from law 23/2007 of July 4, which approves a special visa to the prisoners to
allow their entrance into Portugal.

Japan's PM stresses US ties, need to restore fiscal health

<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's new Prime Minister Naoto Kan on Tuesday vowed to make Japan a "more
vigorous country," restore its public finances and maintain the US alliance as
the "cornerstone" of its diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The new centre-left premier, set to be sworn in later in the day, signalled he
wants to rebuild US ties strained by a damaging row over a US airbase that cost
his predecessor Yukio Hatoyama his job last week.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is necessary to firmly continue the principle that the Japan-US
security alliance is the cornerstone" of Tokyo's diplomacy, Kan said, after
speaking with President Barack Obama in a weekend telephone call.
</P>
<P>
Kan in his inaugural address also said Japan's economic bubble had burst 20
years ago and the country suffers 30,000 suicides a year, and pledged: "I want
to rehabilitate Japan drastically and create a vigorous country."
</P>
<P>
With public debt nearing twice the size of gross domestic product, he pledged
that "rebuilding financial health is essential for Japan's economy".

<TEXT>
<P>
The White House on Friday welcomed the election of Japan's new Prime Minister
Naoto Kan, saying President Barack Obama hoped for "excellent cooperation" with
the new Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Kan will succeed Yukio Hatoyama, who resigned after a damaging dispute with the
Obama administration over the US base on Okinawa, after coming to power
promising a less subordinate relationship with Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the election of Mr Kan as Japan's next Prime Minister and the
President looks forward to speaking with the new Prime Minister soon," National
Security spokesman Mike Hammer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Japan is an important friend and ally. Our partnership is crucial to peace and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"The President is committed to maintaining excellent cooperation with the new
Japanese government and will work closely together with Prime Minister Kan on
bilateral, regional and global issues."
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary vote earlier confirmed Kan as successor to Hatoyama. He is a
former leftist activist and is Japan's fifth premier in four years, and the
first in over a decade not to hail from a political dynasty.

Senate hearing disrupted as woman pours liquid on self
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, June 9, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Senate hearing on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill was disrupted Wednesday as a
protester poured an oily-looking liquid on herself before being arrested.
</P>
<P>
"This is what it feels like to have oil dumped on you," the woman, identified as
Diane Wilson, said in comments addressed to Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
Wilson issued a statement issued later saying she is a fourth generation
shrimper from the Gulf and that her protest was directed against Murkowski for
supporting the oil industry and opposing measures such as lifting the liability
cap on oil firms in offshore spills.
</P>
<P>
Wilson opened a jar and poured a dark, oily-looking substance on her head at the
hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, before being taken
away by Capitol police. Committee staff said later the jar contained syrup.
</P>
<P>
"With this BP disaster, I am seeing the destruction of my community and I am
outraged," Wilson said in her statement.
</P>
<P>
"I am also seeing elected representatives like Senator Lisa Murkowski blocking
BP from being legally responsible to pay for this catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told lawmakers offshore
drilling in the Gulf of Mexico will continue "in a safe way" in the wake of the
massive Deepwater Horizon accident.
</P>
<P>
Salazar told the committee that a range of new regulations implemented following
the accident at the BP-operated well would protect against new spills.
</P>
<P>
"Offshore drilling will continue... it has to be done in a safe way," he told
the panel.
</P>
<P>
Salazar, who heads the agency that oversees oil leasing and management of
federal lands, highlighted tougher safety rules imposed this week for offshore
drilling and the reorganization of the Minerals Management Service, the division
which has been criticized for being too cozy with the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
But he said the rules would not halt all offshore drilling despite the six-month
moratorium on new deepwater wells ordered by President Barack Obama last month.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of the jobs is very much on the mind of the president and on my
mind as well," Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
He told Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana that the administration would ask BP
to pay salaries of oil sector workers whose jobs have been suspended by the
drilling ban.
</P>
<P>
According to committee figures, the Gulf of Mexico has some 3,600 wells or
drilling operations and 700 of them are at depths of around 1,500 meters (5,000
feet) like the Deepwater Horizon.
</P>
<P>
Salazar confirmed that BP was capturing around 15,000 barrels a day from a new
device placed on the wellhead, but was unable to estimate how much was still
leaking.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for us to have the right number. We'll get that right number,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is get zero pollution from this well. Nothing is being spared to bring
this problem under control."

Poland's Walesa warns against 'disastrous' Kaczynski
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WARSAW, June 21, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lech Walesa, former leader of Poland's anti-communist Solidarity union, slammed
conservative presidential candidate Jaroslaw Kaczynski as a "disaster" ahead of
a July 4 run-off ballot.
</P>
<P>
"I'm warning you, he's a disaster," Walesa told Poland's TVN24 news channel
Monday, after the first round of Poland's presidential election in which the
conservative Kaczynski trailed liberal Bronislaw Komorowski by about five per
centage points.
</P>
<P>
Walesa, a former president, has a history of bad blood with Kaczynski and his
twin, Lech Kaczynski, the president who was killed in an air disaster on April
10 forcing the early election.
</P>
<P>
Walesa recalled the difficulties Poland had with its EU partners, particularly
Germany, when Jaroslaw Kaczynski served as prime minister in 2006-2007.
Relations with Russia had also deteriorated under the Kaczynski government.
</P>
<P>
"Poland must not serve as a guinea pig. Poland is part of Europe. With
neighbours you have to negotiate, instead of waving a sword or insulting them,"
Walesa said.
</P>
<P>
Near-complete official results released Monday showed parliamentary speaker and
acting president Komorowski, 58, with just over 41 percent of the vote, putting
him narrowly ahead of opposition leader Kaczynski, 61, the late president's
identical twin, who took close to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
As no candidate scored 50 percent, a July 4 run-off will be held.
</P>
<P>
The strong third-place finish of Social Democrat leader Grzegorz Napieralski,
who garnered nearly 14 percent of the vote, has put the 36-year-old and his
voters in the position of kingmakers in the run-off.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts agree Napieralski voters will opt against Kaczysnki, know for his
often out-spoken criticism of the left.

Football: 'The French team have shamed France' - media
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PARIS, June 21, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The French press poured scorn on the World Cup squad on Monday saying their
refusal to train in protest at the decision to send home striker Nicolas Anelka
had shamed the whole country.
</P>
<P>
If the French squad in South Africa thought they would garner sympathetic
headlines back home over their refusal to train because of Anelka's expulsion
for a foul-mouthed outburst at coach Raymond Domenech then they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
"This France team has shamed us all" commented tabloid 'Le Parisien' while on
the front page they simply put 'Mutiny' above a photograph of the squad at their
training ground in Knysna.
</P>
<P>
The paper didn't hold back in its judgement on the squad - though according to
their information several players were not in favour of the boycott led by
senior players William Gallas, Florent Malouda and Eric Abidal.
</P>
<P>
But as Le Parisien said, other players "followed their lead nevertheless like
sheep" or "because they had no choice" under the pressure of their teammates.
</P>
<P>
"Each day, the Blues set new standards of unacceptable behaviour," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday in order to demonstrate their support of Nicolas Anelka who had been
expelled the day before, they went on strike... this group of spoilt children,
allowed to do whatever they want by the powers above them, therefore do not have
any limits, no sense of duty so close to the match with South Africa."
</P>
<P>
Anelka unleashed his outburst at half-time of France's 2-0 defeat to Mexico
whichy has left them teetering on the brink of elimination.
</P>
<P>
They must beat host nation South Africa by a wide margin on Tuesday, but a draw
between their group rivals Uruguay and Mexico would render the French result
academic.
</P>
<P>
Coach Raymond Domenech, who the French Football Federation steadfastly refused
to replace despite calls from all sides in the lead-up to the finals, does not
escape the paper's opprobrium.
</P>
<P>
"One question raises itself: Would the players have dared to behave in this way
with the great coaches of today like Fabio Capello (England's coach), Marcello
Lippi (Italy) or Ottmar Hitzfeld (Switzerland)?"
</P>
<P>
The paper even goes so far as to equate what happened on the training pitch with
one of France's most traumatic battlefield defeats which brought to a conclusive
end the golden era of Napoleon I.
</P>
<P>
"The mutiny at Knysna will forever be remembered as the Waterloo of French
football."
</P>
<P>
Sports daily L'Equipe, which revealed the Anelka outburst on Saturday, didn't
mince its words about the role of national captain Patrice Evra, who led the
revolt.
</P>
<P>
"Patrice Evra definitively showed that he confused the role of captain with
being a leader of a gang.
</P>
<P>
"He has neither the capacity, nor the charisma nor the qualities to don the
captain's armband."
</P>
<P>
For the paper, however, it also registered the last opportunity for 57-year-old
Domenech to bow out with some grace as he steps down in any case after the
finals and hands over the poisoned chalice to World Cup-winning defender Laurent
Blanc.
</P>
<P>
"Raymond Domenech, by reading this statement from the players missed his final
opportunity to show panache and courage.
</P>
<P>
"Hostage, puppet of his group, he proved once and for all that he has neither
any sense of responsbility nor commitment."
</P>
<P>
The FFF don't escape the withering fire of L'Equipe neither - president Jean-
Pierre Escalettes is described as an "amateur from start to finish" - with only
the liaison director to the squad Jean-Louis Valentin who resigned over the
players' behaviour given credit.
</P>
<P>
"Who maintained Raymond Domenech in power? Who covered up his methods and
defended his arrogance? Who allowed the players to ferment their paranoia and
conspiracy theories?
</P>
<P>
"Let no-one be duped, the expulsion of Nicolas Anelka for his insults, is not a
glorious step for the FFF.
</P>
<P>
"It was the least they could do which adds up to very little, and certainly does
not reduce their immense responsibility in the farcical, theatrical goings-on of
yesterday."
</P>
<P>
Left-leaning daily 'Liberation' headlined its editorial 'Vaudeville' and held
Domenech responsible.
</P>
<P>
"He never assumed the responsbilities of the Euro 2008 failure and clung to his
post.
</P>
<P>
"He confused the pitch with a reality TV studio. In summation Raymond Domenech
accepted to be the plaything of financial interests, the federation, television,
players' agents and other sponsors."
</P>
<P>
The editorial effectively decries the flood of money into football and ends
with: "A sport which yesterday in France lost a lot of credit."

Khatami calls for unity against Iran sanctions: website
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TEHRAN, June 16, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former president turned opposition backer Mohammad Khatami called Wednesday for
Iranian unity against the UN sanctions, which he said were the latest
"hostilities" against the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
"We must be united in the face of the animosity (sanctions) against us,
otherwise how are we to stand against this animosity?" Khatami was quoted as
saying on the reformist website Parlemannews.ir.
</P>
<P>
"These hostilities against Iran will only hurt the people and no one can accept
these acts against Iran and the revolution."
</P>
<P>
But the cleric, who was president between 1997 and 2005, criticised government
policies, which he said were resulting in "disintegration and empowering of the
enemy."
</P>
<P>
"There is considerable pressure on Iran. The resolution adopted in the (UN)
Security Council is targeted at our country at a time when not only no measure
is taken against Isareli atrocities, there is also support for them."
</P>
<P>
He too insisted that Iran wanted a civilian nuclear programme.
</P>
<P>
A few days before the sanctions were imposed on June 9, opposition leader Mir
Hossein Mousavi also opposed them.
</P>
<P>
"Although we regard the current situation a result of mismanagement and
adventurism in foreign policy, we cannot agree with sanctions which will affect
people's lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former two-time president and opposition supporter Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani too
called for unity a few days after the sanctions were imposed.

Israel should be "punished" for its "bloody massacre" on aid ships bound for
Gaza, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday, as he warned the
Jewish state not to test Turkey's patience.

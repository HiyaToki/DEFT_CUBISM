Obama hails New Orleans 'resilience' five years post-Katrina
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana, Aug 29, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US President Barack Obama, marking the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina in
New Orleans Sunday, praised the city's resilience and pledged support for
rebuilding "until the job is done."
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the famed jazz city, where at least 1,500 people died in
the storm and its aftermath, was still in need of support, but said community
efforts had ensured "New Orleans is blossoming once more."
</P>
<P>
"Together, we are helping to make New Orleans a place that stands for what we
can do in America, not just for what we can't do," he said in a speech at the
city's Xavier University.
</P>
<P>
Obama acknowledged that the storm, which brought waves of water that overcame
levees carrying homes and residents away, "was a natural disaster, but also a
manmade catastrophe, a shameful breakdown in government."
</P>
<P>
But he pledged that the region, struggling with the long-term effects of the
tragedy, the economic downturn and, most recently the Gulf of Mexico oil spill,
would be able to rely on the administration for support.
</P>
<P>
"My administration is going to stand with you -- and fight alongside you --
until the job is done," he told a cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
Long famed for its rich music scene and its easy-going spirit, New Orleans was
plunged into chaos on August 29, 2005 when torrents of water broke through
barriers and gushed in.
</P>
<P>
Although 1.4 million residents and visitors were ordered to evacuate as the
monster storm approached, many could not or would not and were left stranded.
</P>
<P>
A lack of preparation and bungled coordination forced residents to take shelter
in attics, and then break through their roofs to escape rising water.
</P>
<P>
Footage of desperate Americans, waving signs reading "Help Us," horrified people
at home and abroad. In the Lower Ninth Ward, the poorest part of the city, built
in a basin and 99 percent black, bodies drifted lifelessly with the floodwater.
</P>
<P>
Many fled to the Superdome, the stadium where 10,000 people displaced by the
hurricane had already sought refuge, but it too became cut off by the water.
</P>
<P>
And rescue services were overrun as the disaster that reached deep into
neighboring Mississippi and Alabama unfolded, an entire region deprived of
electricity, communications and drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the National Guard was deployed, and managed to restore a semblance of
order, helping coordinate airlifts and bus evacuations that scattered survivors
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Six days after disaster struck, the Superdome was finally emptied, but it took
two months for the floodwaters to subside, and rescuers were still finding
bodies more than six months later.
</P>
<P>
"New Orleans could have remained a symbol of destruction and decay; of a storm
that came and the inadequate response that followed," Obama said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"But it's a symbol of resilience, of community, of the fundamental
responsibility we have for each other."
</P>
<P>
Ahead of Obama's arrival, the White House touted its commitment to the region,
citing efforts to "cut through red tape," and help families still in temporary
shelters find more permanent homes.
</P>
<P>
The administration said it had provided grants to bolster the local justice and
health care systems, set up programs to improve handling of emergencies and
rebuilt 220 miles (350 kilometers) of levees to pre-Katrina standards.
</P>
<P>
But many in the city question why the levees are being rebuilt to specifications
that failed when Katrina struck.
</P>
<P>
And five years on, whole neighborhoods in The Big Easy remain abandoned to rot
and ruin.
</P>
<P>
In the lower Ninth Ward, grass and wild plants surround concrete foundation
slabs -- stone memorials of the houses that were washed away.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Robert Green was stranded on his roof. He lost his mother and
his granddaughter to the floodwaters as the house broke apart underneath his
feet.
</P>
<P>
He now lives in a house built by actor Brad Pitt's Make it Right foundation.
</P>
<P>
He would like to see the city claim the homes of those who have yet to return,
even if that means changing the character of his historic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line of it is, we need families, we need young life, young blood,"
said Green. "We could sit around and wait 20 years for people to come back, or
we could realize and say 'So what? I have a Hispanic neighbor, a Vietnamese
neighbor,' we've got to open it up."
</P>
<P>
The day of commemorations concluded with a memorial service combining
commemoration with celebration at the Mahalia Jackson Theater in Armstrong Park,
in the heart of downtown New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
"We must face the truth that in the fifth year of the 21st century, for four
horrific days, there was anarchy on the streets of America," said Mayor Mitch
Landrieu. "The levees broke and our government failed. It's a moment we should
never forget and one that we should never repeat."
</P>
<P>
"America, hear this," Landrieu continued. "The people of New Orleans are still
standing, unbowed and unbroken."
</P>
<P>
Landrieu said the storm also taught New Orleans residents valuable lessons about
the value of being good neighbors and cooperation between people of different
backgrounds.

Appeal lodged after California gay marriage ban overturned
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES, Aug 5, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of same-sex marriage formally challenged on Thursday a decision to
overturn California's ban on gay weddings, launching an appeals process expected
to end up before the US Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
US District Court Judge Vaughn Walker ruled Wednesday in favor of activists who
argued that a state referendum which barred gays and lesbians from tying the
knot was discriminatory and therefore violated the US Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The referendum, known as Proposition 8, was passed by a 52 percent majority in
November 2008, only six months after California's Supreme Court overturned a
previous ban on same-sex weddings, sending gays and lesbians flocking to marry.
</P>
<P>
Socially conservative opponents of same-sex weddings reacted furiously to the
decision, accusing Walker -- who is gay -- of allowing his sexual orientation to
influence his ruling.
</P>
<P>
Randy Thomasson of the Campaign for Children and Families (SaveCalifornia.com)
described the decision as a "terrible blow" to voter rights.
</P>
<P>
"Judge Walker has ignored the written words of the Constitution, which he swore
to support and defend and be impartially faithful to, and has instead imposed
his own homosexual agenda upon the voters, the parents and the children of
California," Thomasson said.
</P>
<P>
The president of the American Family Association, Tim Wildmon, meanwhile accused
Walker of a "tyrannical, abusive and utterly unconstitutional display of
judicial arrogance."
</P>
<P>
Legal experts believe the case is almost certain to end up before the US Supreme
Court in around two years time, once appeals hearings in lower courts have run
their course.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion released on Wednesday, Walker ruled that Proposition 8 failed to
"advance any rational basis" to deny gay men and lesbians marriage licenses.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed the evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the
California constitution the notion that opposite sex couples are superior to
same sex couples," Walker wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Because California has no interest in discriminating against gay men and
lesbians and because Proposition 8 prevents California from fulfilling its
constitutional obligations to provide marriages on an equal basis, the court
concludes that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
Walker later issued a ruling granting a temporary stay of his order until
Friday, allowing opponents of same-sex marriage time to file their appeals, a
move that appeared to prevent an immediate resumption of weddings between gays
and lesbians in the most populous US state.
</P>
<P>
Walker is expected to decide whether same-sex weddings can resume in California
by Friday.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of several hundred people celebrated Walker's decision in Los Angeles'
gay enclave of West Hollywood late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hollywood director Rob Reiner, one of the prominent celebrity supporters of gay
marriage, said the issue had built an unstoppable momentum.
</P>
<P>
"When we make it to the Supreme Court, and we win, this will take its place
alongside Brown vs The Board of Education," Reiner told AFP, referring to the
famous Supreme Court decision that desegregated American public schools.
</P>
<P>
"The tide is shifting in this country."

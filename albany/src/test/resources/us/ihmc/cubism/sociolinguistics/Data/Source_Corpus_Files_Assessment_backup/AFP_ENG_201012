Iran frees stoning woman: German campaign group
</HEADLINE>

BERLIN, Dec 9, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iran has freed a woman sentenced to death by stoning for adultery, her son and
her lawyer, a German-based campaign group told AFP Thursday after global outcry
over the case.
</P>
<P>
"We have got news from Iran that they are free," Mina Ahadi, spokeswoman for the
Anti-Stoning Committee, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for another confirmation: apparently there will be a programme
this evening on (Iranian) television and then we will be 100 percent sure."
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate confirmation from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini immediately hailed the reported release
and lauded it as "a great day for human rights."
</P>
<P>
"Iran has made the gesture of understanding and clemency that we were hoping for
and it did so using its prerogative as a sovereign state," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a decision that merits strong praise and satisfaction," he said.     "We
take note of this in the knowledge that the prospect for dialogue with Iran also
on human rights can resume in a spirit of renewed mutual confidence."
</P>
<P>
Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, a 43-year-old mother of two, was initially given
death sentences by two different courts in the northwestern city of Tabriz in
separate trials in 2006.
</P>
<P>
A sentence to hang for her involvement in the murder of her husband was commuted
to a 10-year jail term by an appeals court in 2007.
</P>
<P>
But a second sentence, to death by stoning on charges of adultery levelled over
several relationships, notably with the man convicted of her husband's murder,
was upheld by another appeals court the same year.
</P>
<P>
Sakineh's current lawyer, Javid Houtan Kian, was arrested in the northwestern
city of Tabriz in September along with two Germans who were conducting an
interview with her son.
</P>
<P>
The Germans, who entered Iran on tourist visas, are accused of spying.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the international outcry over the death sentence, the head of Iran's
High Human Rights Council drew parallels between her case and that of Teresa
Lewis, a 41-year-old American grandmother who was executed in the United States
in late September for murder.
</P>
<P>
"Our judiciary made a lot of efforts (in reviewing the case) and we think there
is a good chance her life could be saved," Mohammed Javad Larijani told Iran's
English-language Press TV in November.

torn aorta.

in 2014, his chief of staff said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I think that (Lula) will look at the political situation. If Dilma's government
goes well, of course she will seek reelection. If there are difficulties and
Lula is the answer for (the Workers' Party) to win, he could be a candidate,"
chief of satff Gilberto Carvalho said in an interview publishred Sunday in the O
Globo newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Lula has a staggering 87 percent approval arting after his eight years in
office.
</P>

Asked if he would risk his favorable legacy, Carvalho said "that would be a risk
... but Lula would come back in a favorable position. Or a very necessary one."
</P>
<P>
Brazil's constitituion does not allow Lula to seek three consecutive terms.
</P>
<P>
Rousseff, elected in October, is the first woman voters chose as Brazil's
leader.

British far-right group 'withdraws invite to US pastor'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, Dec 14, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A British far-right group has cancelled plans for firebrand US pastor Terry
Jones to speak at one of its events after saying it disagreed with his views on
race and homosexuality, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
But Jones, who sparked an international furore after threatening to burn the
Koran, the holy book of Islam, on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, said he
would likely still come to Britain and planned to organise an event in London.
</P>
<P>
Far-right group the English Defence League (EDL), which organises protests
against what it terms as the "Islamification" of England, had invited the
controversial pastor to speak at a rally in February.
</P>
<P>
There were concerns his presence could inflame community relations in Britain
and interior minister Theresa May had said she was considering whether she
should block Jones from coming.
</P>
<P>
But the EDL said Monday they had decided Jones would not be speaking at their
rally.
</P>
<P>
EDL spokesman Guramit Singh told the BBC that "after doing some research and
seeing what his personal opinions are on racism and homosexuality, we are not
allowing him to speak at our demonstration.
</P>
<P>
"He is not the right candidate for us."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Although the English Defence League are sincere to what he has to say
about Islam, we do not agree with some of his manifesto such as some of his
issues with homosexuality and some of his issues with race.
</P>
<P>
"The EDL is anti-homophobic and we are a non-racism organisation."
</P>
<P>
But Jones said the EDL "had bowed to pressure from the government... and people
within their own organisation," in comments to the BBC.
</P>
<P>
"We will probably come to London sometime in February and organise something in
London," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jones had earlier said he would fight an attempt by the British government to
block him from visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
The EDL rally is taking place on February 5 in Luton, a town north of London
which has a significant Muslim population.
</P>
<P>
Police have been searching a property in the town, believed to have been the
home of a suspected suicide bomber who blew himself up in a attack in Stockholm
on Saturday.

Football: Maradona threatens legal action against Grondona
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BUENOS AIRES, Dec 24, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diego Maradona threatened legal action against Argentine football association
president Julio Grondona on Friday as their bitter post-World Cup war of words
took another dramatic twist.
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to go on about Grondona. I am going directly to see my lawyers
to start an action after all he has said. He has lost control," Maradona told
the Clarin newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Maradona and Grondona have been at loggerheads since the Argentine football
legend was deposed as coach following the team's 4-0 defeat to Germany at the
World Cup quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the 79-year-old Grondona hit back at Maradona for describing him as
"senile".
</P>
<P>
"I am not senile, I am not an informer and I never will be," said the federation
chief.
</P>
<P>
"One day he (Maradona) loves you, the next he hates you. There are reasons for
this, we all know what they are," added Grondona, alluding to Maradona's long-
time battle with drugs.
</P>
<P>
Maradona insisted on Friday that he is now free of drug and alcohol problems.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't taken anything for six years, not even a glass of wine."

WikiLeaks accuses Amazon of lying, calls it 'cowardly'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, Dec 3, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WikiLeaks lashed out at Amazon on Friday for kicking the whistleblower website
off its servers, accusing the US company of lying and being "cowardly."
</P>
<P>
The accusations came after Amazon broke days of silence and provided its first
explanation for its decision to no longer provide Web-hosting services to
WikiLeaks.
</P>
<P>
Amazon Web Services, in a message on its website, said it cut off WikiLeaks
because it had violated the company's terms of service and not because of any
government pressure.
</P>
<P>
WikiLeaks fired back at Amazon with a message on its Twitter feed. "Amazon's
press release does not accord with the facts on public record. It is one thing
to be cowardly. Another to lie about it," WikiLeaks said.

Under fire Amazon stops hosting WikiLeaks
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, Dec 1, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amazon, after coming under fire for hosting WikiLeaks, booted it from its
servers on Wednesday, prompting the whistleblower website to shift to Web-
hosting services in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"This morning Amazon informed my staff that it has ceased to host the WikiLeaks
website," Senator Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I wish that Amazon had taken this action earlier based on WikiLeaks' previous
publication of classified material," the independent senator from Connecticut
said.
</P>
<P>
WikiLeaks, in a message on its Twitter feed @wikileaks, said: "WikiLeaks servers
at Amazon ousted. Free speech the land of the free -- fine our dollars are now
spent to employ people in Europe."
</P>
<P>
The WikiLeaks website was sluggish and periodically unavailable on Wednesday but
it was not immediately clear if this was due to its hosting issues or if it had
again come under cyberattack as in previous days.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman said Amazon's decision to cut off WikiLeaks "is the right decision and
should set the standard for other companies WikiLeaks is using to distribute its
illegally seized material."
</P>
<P>
WikiLeaks on Sunday began publishing the first batch of more than 250,000 US
diplomatic cables the website is believed to have obtained from a disaffected US
soldier.
</P>
<P>
Amazon is a major provider of Web-hosting services, renting out space on its
computer servers to customers around the world. It has not responded to repeated
requests from AFP for confirmation that it was hosting WikiLeaks.
</P>
<P>
But Jon Karlung, chairman of the Swedish firm Bahnhof, which also hosts some
WikiLeaks documents, said Tuesday that the WikiLeaks website featuring the US
diplomatic cables was being primarily hosted by the Seattle-based Amazon.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman urged any other company hosting WikiLeaks to "immediately terminate
its relationship with them."
</P>
<P>
"WikiLeaks' illegal, outrageous, and reckless acts have compromised our national
security and put lives at risk around the world," Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
"No responsible company -- whether American or foreign -- should assist
WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate these stolen materials," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I will be asking Amazon about the extent of its relationship with WikiLeaks and
what it and other Web service providers will do in the future to ensure that
their services are not used to distribute stolen, classified information,"
Lieberman added.
</P>
<P>
The global police agency Interpol has issued a global wanted notice for
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on suspicion of rape, on the basis of a Swedish
arrest warrant. Assange, a 39-year-old Australian believed to be in hiding in
Europe, has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
WikiLeaks said Sunday and again on Monday that it was the target of distributed
denial of service, or DDoS, attacks aimed at shutting down or slowing the
website.
</P>
<P>
Classic DDoS attacks occur when legions of "zombie" computers, normally machines
infected with viruses, are commanded to simultaneously visit a website,
overwhelming servers or knocking them offline completely.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a computer hacker known as the "Jester" claimed responsibility for
temporarily taking down the WikiLeaks website on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at computer security firm F-Secure, told
AFP he believed the "Jester," who has targeted Islamic jihadist websites in the
past, had the ability to carry out the attack on WikiLeaks.
</P>
<P>
"He's demonstrated previously that he is capable of launching effective denial-
of-service attacks, and he's claimed the responsibility for this one as well,"
Hypponen said. "He has the capability and the motive."

China calls Japan comments on military 'irresponsible'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING, Dec 17, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China on Friday criticised as "irresponsible" a new Japanese military policy
that labelled an ongoing Chinese armed forces build-up as a global concern.
</P>
<P>
"No country has the right to appoint themselves the representative of the
international community and make irresponsible comments on China's development,"
foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after Japan said it would strengthen missile defences
against the threat from North Korea, as part of a major strategic review that
also raised concern about China's military rise.
</P>
<P>
The changes would see Tokyo boost its southern forces and submarine fleet and
upgrade its fighter jets as part of a shift in its defence focus from the Soviet
Cold War threat to southern islands nearer China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's statement also reiterated China's position that its military policy is
aimed purely at national defence.
</P>
<P>
"We do not intend to be a threat to anybody," she said.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet of officially pacifist Japan approved the National Defence Programme
Guidelines months after a territorial row flared up with China and weeks after
North Korea launched a deadly artillery strike against South Korea.

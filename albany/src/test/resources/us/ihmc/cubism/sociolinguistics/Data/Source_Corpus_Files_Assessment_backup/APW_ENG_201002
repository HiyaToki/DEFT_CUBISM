Big Machine Records CEO Scott Borchetta says Swift "is the voice of this generation."
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Borchetta says there was a technical problem with the volume on Swift's earpiece. He says Swift "wasn't able to hear everything in the mix."

Stewart tells O ' Reilly he ' s voice of sanity on Fox
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK 2010-02-04 05:16:30 UTC

<TEXT>
<P>
Comic Jon Stewart told conservative TV host Bill O'Reilly that he has become the voice of sanity on Fox News Channel, although "that's like being the thinnest kid at fat camp."
</P>
<P>
The host of "The Daily Show" and Fox's kingpin exchanged some good-natured shots Wednesday during Stewart's appearance on a network he relishes mocking. Stewart tossed off jokes but also criticized Fox for being a "cyclonic perpetual motion machine" opposing President Barack Obama.
</P>
<P>
"They have taken reasonable concerns about this president and this economy and turned it into a full-fledged panic attack about the next coming of Chairman Mao," Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
O'Reilly said the Obama attacks were primarily coming from Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck, who have two of the highest-rated programs on Fox. O'Reilly called Beck an "everyman."
</P>
<P>
"He just spouts," O'Reilly said. "He spouts for what he believes. If you think Beck spouts for the Republican Party, you're out of your mind."
</P>
<P>
Fox cut off the taped interview at that point, saying more would be shown Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both men have appeared on each other's show before, but it was Stewart's first time back since 2004. O'Reilly annoyed Comedy Central by calling Stewart's audience primarily "stoned slackers"; on Wednesday, he amended it to "stoned slackers who love Obama."
</P>
<P>
There was even a dispute over who initiated the return visit. O'Reilly said on Fox earlier Wednesday that Stewart's representatives had asked for him to come on the show. Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox said an O'Reilly producer requested the appearance.
</P>
<P>
Fox "is the most passionate and sells the clearest narrative of all the news networks, if ... you're still referring to it in that manner," Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
O'Reilly pointed out that Fox is like a newspaper with news and opinion pages, an idea Stewart poked fun at.
</P>
<P>
"Fox in and of itself doesn't say you're a news network all day," he said. "What is it, you're news from 9 to 11, then you're opinion, then you're news again from 1 to 2:30 except for the Jewish holidays? And then on alternate parking days you're news, but Christmas, you're not?"
</P>
<P>
Stewart was asked about a Washington Post column that suggested he was becoming disenchanted with Obama. "I don't take any of that seriously," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he did criticize Obama for not taking control of his agenda.
</P>
<P>
"It allows too much room for different narratives to take hold, for instance, a narrative that might emanate from a news organization of this ilk," he said.

Unilever Q4 net profit falls 27 percent
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
AMSTERDAM 2010-02-04 09:34:29 UTC

<TEXT>
<P>
Unilever NV, maker of consumer products such as Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream and Dove soap, saw fourth quarter earnings fall by 27 percent after its year-ago figures were boosted by a one-time gain on the sale of its Bertolli olive oil business.
</P>
<P>
Net profit was (EURO)831 million ($1.15 billion) down from (EURO)1.14 billion a year earlier, when Unilever sold Bertolli to Spain's Grupo SOS for (EURO)630 million. Fourth quarter sales fell 5 percent to (EURO)9.66 billion, also due in part to the Bertolli sale.
</P>
<P>
Unilever said that stripping out the impact of disposals and restructuring, fourth quarter operating profit would have risen 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said sales measured on the same basis rose 1.8 percent, with volume growth of 5 percent outweighing price falls of 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Unilever has cut prices in order not to lose market share as customers show a preference for cheaper brands during the recession.
</P>
<P>
In 2010 "consumers will be even more demanding, and rightfully so," said Chief Executive Paul Polman on a conference call. "Our priorities therefore for 2010 are to drive volume growth while providing a steady improvement in underlying profit margin."
</P>
<P>
Shares fell 2.5 percent to (EURO)21.93 in early trading in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
"Unilever has delivered a solid if not inspirational performance," said analyst Keith Bowman of Hargreaves Lansdown in a note on the earnings.
</P>
<P>
He praised the company's sales growth, particularly in Asia and Africa. There sales rose 7.4 percent and are now substantially larger than in either the Americas and Europe. Sales growth in the Americas was 1.2 percent, while sales fell 4.2 percent in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Bowman warned that Unilever's costs could rise this year, threatening the company's plans to continue improving both sales and margins. "On the downside, commodity prices remain volatile, while a recent recovery in advertising volumes for the media industry could see a bounce back in prices," Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
Unilever's full year net profit was (EURO)3.66 billion, down 33 percent from 2008, on sales of (EURO)39.8 billion, which were down 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among major product lines, Unilever gave only full year sales growth data.
</P>
<P>
Personal care products such as Dove soap and Axe deodorants grew 5.3 percent. Laundry and cleaning products such as Surf, Omo and Cif, grew 7.1 percent. And ice cream and beverages such as Ben &amp; Jerry's, Magnum and Lipton tea brands, grew 4 percent. Polman noted that sales of Klondike bars grew more than 10 percent in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Sales of dressings and spreads such as Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr soups fell 0.1 percent.

<P>
A group of Saudi activists has urged King Abdullah to set up an independent commission to probe human rights violations by the nation's powerful security agencies.
</P>
<P>
The group -- the Committee of Civil and Political Rights -- also called on the monarch to introduce political reforms he promised when he ascended to the throne in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The group includes lawyers, university professors and writers and is led by university lecturer Abdul-Rahman al-Hamid. It was set up in October, according to its Web site.
</P>
<P>
In a statement posted Wednesday on its web site, the group blamed the violations on the Ministry of Interior, led by the monarch's half brother, Prince Nayef. It says the violations are tantamount to crimes against humanity.

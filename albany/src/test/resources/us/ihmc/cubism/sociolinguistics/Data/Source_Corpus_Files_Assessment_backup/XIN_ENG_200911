<P>
The Central Committee of the Palestinian Fatah party said Sunday it supports
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' refusal to resume negotiations with Israel
until the Jewish state stops settlement in the occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee said in a statement that Abbas' rejection to resume peace
talks with Israel has met the expectations of the national and factional sectors
that there should be "clear basis for resuming the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The highest decision-making body of Abbas' Fatah party stressed that the
negotiations "are pointless as long as Israel continues to construct settlements
without submitting itself to the international resolutions."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked Abbas to drop his
condition of not to resume the peace talks with Israel unless it freezes
settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
For the Palestinians, the settlements grab the land they hope to have their
future statehood on.

25 local gov'ts in Indonesia to receive basic education capacity

<DATELINE>
JAKARTA, Nov. 23 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-five local governments in Indonesia are set to receive grants for
capacity development in basic education governance following the signing of
Letters of Agreement for Grants Channeling between the Ministry of Finance, the
Ministry of National Education, and 25 Basic Education Capacity Trust Fund (BEC-
TF) partner districts on Monday, a statement from the World Bank said here.
</P>
<P>
The grants are part of the BEC-TF's commitment to work with 50 local governments
in nine provinces to manage education finance and information systems more
effectively and transparently through 2012.
</P>
<P>
The BEC-TF aims to support the government of Indonesia in carrying out its
education reform agenda, which includes: supporting an Education Thematic
Dialogue Forum; improving governance, financial management, budgeting, and
accountability in the education sector; and strengthening the education
information management system.
</P>
<P>
The BEC-TF capacity development grant comes from the Dutch government (22
million euro) and the European Commission (17 million euro), managed by the
World Bank and executed by the Indonesian Ministry of National Education.
</P>
<P>
In September, the first wave of 25 local governments signed their agreements.
The total of 50 districts were chosen through a selection and verification
process within the government.
</P>
<P>
Grant channeling to regional governments within the framework of central-region
financial relation in the education sector, is highly appreciated by donor
agencies.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the BEC-TF will be major breakthrough in the way education
support is provided to the district level. The new on- granting regulation is a
big step forward and I would like to congratulate the Government with making
this possible," stated Dutch Ambassador Nikolaos van Dam.
</P>
<P>
Julian Wilson, Ambassador/Head of Delegation of the European Commission, said
that basic education is the major sector of support for the European Commission
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Our grant support to the BEC-TF aims in particular to help local governments in
making efficient use of financial resources to improve education outcomes,"
stated Wilson.
</P>
<P>
Districts that are successful in developing their education governance will have
the opportunity to receive performance-based grants provided by the Sector
Improvement through Sector Wide Approach (SISWA) program in the future.
</P>
<P>
SISWA is the Indonesian government basic education development framework in line
with the medium term plan which covers key strategies and programs to improve
access and quality basic education under the Ministry of National Education, the
Ministry of Religious Af-fairs, and the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Arab and African nations, he said.

On the Middle East issue, Wen said China supported a solution based on U.N.
relevant resolutions, the "land for peace" principle and the Arab Peace
Initiative. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict should be solved through dialogue

Chinese CEO opens market for Toronto Stock Exchange

TORONTO, Nov. 13 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jun Liu, CEO of China Wind Power International Corp., and Robert Fotheringham,
Senior Vice President of TMX Group, opened the market for Toronto Stock Exchange
(TSX) and TSX Venture Exchange on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We gather to celebrate the success of a wonderful company -- China Wind Power
International Corporation," said Fotheringham. " Canadian Finance Minister James
Flaherty, while in China earlier this year to lead a trade mission, used the
example of China Wind Power ... when he spoke about the future and the great
opportunity for China and Canada to work together."
</P>
<P>
China Wind Power indirectly holds the exclusive rights for wind energy
development in Du Mon County, Heilongjiang Province of northeast China. It was
the sixth Chinese company listed on TSX Venture Exchange in 2009, and started to
trade on Aug. 5 under the stock symbol CNW.
</P>
<P>
The company announced on Thursday the signing of letters of intent to acquire
two wind farm sites -- one in Dongning County, in the eastern part of
Heilongjiang Province, and the other in Anda City in southwestern Heilongjiang.
Both wind farm sites to be acquired have obtained all necessary government pre-
approvals and are in the process of obtaining final approvals.
</P>
<P>
"The acquisition of these two development sites would extend our wind energy
potential beyond that of Du Mon County," said Liu. "We would expect to enter
definitive agreements to purchase these two sites upon the sites receiving final
government approvals for wind energy development."
</P>
<P>
The company also announced that it has amended its Wind Power Base Master Plan
for wind energy development in Du Mon County based on a recent wind assessment
of an expanded area of 612 square kilometers, which demonstrated wind energy
potential of 1, 150 MW for the area.
</P>
<P>
The company said that its expanded Master Plan has obtained pre- approvals from
different government agencies and has been included into the newly compiled
Heilongjiang Province Renewable Energy Development Plan. The final approval for
the expanded Master Plan is expected to be obtained in June 2010.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the expanded Master Plan would enable the company to build out
capacity of 200 MW to 400 MW each year for the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
"China Wind Power International is at the center of what I believe to be the
most exciting segment of the market today," said Fotheringham.

An African man who helped the elderly and sick as a nurse's aide in the United States is back in his homeland to be crowned king of his people in western Uganda.

Charles Wesley Mumbere's coronation is set for Monday. He will rule over Rwenzururu, a mountain kingdom of about 300,000 people that is now recognized by the Ugandan government.

Mumbere lived in the United States for 25 years. He kept his royal roots secret until July, when he granted an interview to The Patriot-News of Harrisburg as he was preparing to return to Uganda.

Mumbere, now in his 50s, came to the United States in 1984. He moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's capital, in 1999 and worked for at least two health care facilities there.

Ronaldo: Rooney ' would be a sensation '  at Madrid

<P>
Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney would be a "sensation" if he played for Real Madrid, former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo said.
</P>
<P>
"He would be brilliant if he came. This is the ideal place for the world's best players and there's little doubt he is one of them," Ronaldo said in Saturday's edition of The Sun newspaper. "Wayne would be a sensation out here."
</P>
<P>
Madrid has failed to win any of its past three games, including a 4-0 loss to third-division club Alcorcon in the first leg of the fourth round of the Copa del Rey. Ronaldo, who left United for Madrid in the offseason, missed all three of those matches with an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
Despite his desire to reunite with Rooney, however, Ronaldo isn't expecting it to happen anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
"I realize it would take a lot for him to move from England," Ronaldo said. "He loves the country, he loves Manchester and he is a Liverpool boy. And United is a good club for him. But you never know what could happen in the future."

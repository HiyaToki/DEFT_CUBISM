What rapper if killed would remind you of biggie and tupac? for me it'd be jarule

When tupac and biggie were killed (well not so sure if tupac is actually dead) the places still excist today so if say ja rule or lil wayne was n the same place the same thing could happen again, it would look like the scene from the killing of that biggie smalls lad. A black rapper in similar surroundings. currently Ja rule is in prison regarding tax evasion and driving offences <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

I guess from the 'greatest rapper' perspective it has to me Eminem. I personally think he's the best mc to bless my ears, though 2pac and biggie often are accredited with this purely because they're dead. If Em was killed tomorrow, no doubt he'd go down in the books as the best all time.

So from that kinda perspective, has to be m.

General release only in 2009 and it's only eligible for the Oscars 2009 so I think I should count it in 2009. I don't watch downloads especially not for a film like this so will be seeing it on 16th.

Next thing I want Mickey Rourke to play Charles Bukowski (Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei have both played in films based on Bukowski's books: Barfly and Factotum). He even looks like him now with his messed up plastic surgery and heavy drinking/drug-taking.

I've seen it and I must say Mickey Rourke's performance is an amazing one - just to think it could've been Nicholas Cage in the role instead.

That's because you didn't experience the 80s and the early 90s. Those were the days with WWF (not WWE), Hulk Hogan, the Undertaker, British Bulldog, Randy Savage, Bret "the Hitman" Hart and the other guys in WCW like Sting.

And the good music back then...

You do realise that:

a) General US release was 2008
b) The Oscars are American
c) 2009 Oscars honour 2008 films?

Anyway, The Wrestler was a fantastic film. The best of the year other than TDK. Made me very nostalgiac for the wrestling days of old.

Actually it wasn't a general release in 2008 but a limited one but due to the fact that it's a low-budget film. It's only now in 2009, actually getting released in other cinemas.

As for explaining to me that the Oscars are American but thanks, I lived several years in New England. You're right in correcting my reasoning re the Oscars as it just met the requirements to qualify for 2009 as it was on release in Los Angeles before the end of 2008.

From a British point of view, it's a 2009 film though.

That's not correct - it's only getting a limited US release (no "wide" release), as with many other Oscar-period films at the moment. The UK release would be deemed "limited" also, but there are so few cinemas in the UK compared to America that there's no point.

Still, film releases cannot be considered "from a British point of view", a film is given the year in which it is first released in a non-festival format. Many foreign films are released 1-2 years before they ever come out here or in America, but they would still be a film of whatever year they were first released in. This is very much an objective matter - I don't expect casual filmgoers to call it a 2008 film (as they will have no idea), but those that know when it was first released should.

Its really good but incredibly depressing, just one bad thing after another happening to poor Randy, really fantastic performance, perfectly suited to Rourke and a really good film, not something I'd say I enjoyed watching though, particularly the staple gun scene, ewww

Really? I didn't think it was very predictable actually. Okay, so maybe it was obvious he would get back in the ring towards the end. It had all the potential for obvious "retired" sportsman film cliches (estranged daughter, love interest...) and for a moment I was worrying Aronofsky would lead the film down that path, with a nice happy resolution. But I was genuinely surprised by the closing act of the film.

I'm so glad he isn't the type of director to take the easy formulaic approach to film making.

Sorry, maybe it's just me but I don't get the idea that she's not beautiful. I think she's one of the most beautiful actresses out there. I saw My Cousin Vinny when I was a kid but she didn't look that great in it (although it won her an Oscar).
She started looking far better in her late thirties and now that she's in her 40s, I think you'd struggle to find many Hollywood actresses who look that good at her age without plastic surgery and a slab of makeup on their face.

If only most women looked like that when they turn 40...

Anyway, after all that ranting about Marisa Tomei (who after the fact that Darren Aronofosky directs the Wrestler, was my other motivation to see the film), I finally got to see it this weekend.

The film shows very little of Darren Aronofsky's typical filming techniques from Requiem For A Dream and Pi: apart from the camera following the back of the head of the actors (and even then, he didn't seem to use his technique of attaching the camera to the actor as he did in his two first films).

Clint Mansell's score really adds to the film and that last scene is where his music really enhances those emotions.

The story is really touching and there's some great acting from both Rourke and Tomei, mainly because Randy the Ram's story is not too dissimilar to his own but the story may have lacked a tiny bit of substance. In any case, it probably remains one of the best films of the year simply due to a great, original story, a fantastic music score and soundtrack and some quality cinematography.

An outstanding film that was so evocative. It was sad, funny, touching and thought provoking all at the same time.

I've a soft spot for Wrestling, but the film went beyond its sub-text, just a really powerful story where the strength of the characters played the key role.

ROH being in it is a great thing, CZW not so much because they've always been a bottom-rate ECW rip-off. Loving the ECW Arena being in it as well (Viking Hall).

Oh sweet, I didn't realise Viking Hall was in it! I heard rumours recently that Viking Hall was becoming a fitness place or something but the latest I heard on that now is that they were just rumours and nothing more than that. That's true about CZW though, but at least they're a better rip off of the original ECW than the WWE-friendly ECW now, not that I don't like the WWE version of ECW though, it's just that I think calling that show ECW is a bit of a slap in the face to what ECW initially stood for.

But yeah RoH being in it is brilliant and should be a good way for them to get noticed and recognised more now, I miss not having The Wrestling Channel anymore, I remember the first time I saw RoH was on a tester on Friendly TV for that channel to air.

Yeah I think McGuinness is in it, Wikipedia says he is anyway, the list of the cast is on Wikipedia as:

Normus (who passed away in early 2009), Nick Berk, DJ Hyde, Havoc, Johnny Mangus, Billy Dream, Eric Cobian, Sabian, Nate Hatred, Sugga, LA Smooth, Whacks, Devon Moore, The Funky Samoans, Jim Powers, Kid USA, Ron Killings, Claudio Castagnoli, Romeo Roselli, John Zandig and Nigel McGuinness. In addition, several local New Jersey wrestlers from Bodyslam Wrestling Organization and NWA Liberty States appear in the crowd during Randy's match against Tommy Rotten.

Viking hall (New Alhambra Arena) is nothing like in the good old days of ECW though unfortunately. I think it'll continue to be used for wrestling but Heyman refused to do One Night Stand there because it didn't have the soul of "the arena". Although the Hardcore Homecoming events they did there were pretty good on ONS weekend a few years back.

The WWE version of ECW does still kinda stand for the things that the old ECW did though. They push a lot of athletic competition and focus a lot on wrestling, and elevate younger talent to move onto better things. And ultimately, ECW on Sci-fi is still 9 weeks out of 10 the best wrestling show on television, ahead of both Smackdown and RAW.

I love ROH, although I wouldn't like to go to one of their live shows particularly because they're about 5 hours long. I think its the start of bigger and better things for them though, being in the movie, clearing new ppv markets and replacing their booker to change the products direction all within 6 months. <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

I hope ROH really grows and becomes a great, viable alternative to the WWE product, because really theres nothing else out there. TNA is still there, of course, but most of their shows absolutely suck beyond belief.

Well Viking Hall was probably a bit too small for a WWE event, that's what One Night Stand actually was really, the two One Night Stands were great though due to the authentic ECW feel and Heyman was actually there to give his input. They were probably in the top three of WWE PPVs for their year. I have the four disc box set of Hardcore Homecoming actually but have yet to watch them, I saw part of the first one when I was over in Ireland at my cousins and thought it looked great but I just never got around to watching them when I bought them.

I suppose what I meant about the things ECW stands for I kind of meant along the lines of what you mentioned but also the grotty bingo halls, the fans with so much passion, the fact that it was a small, intimate place and it was a mix of wrestling, lucha libre and there were no disqualifications, the fans brought their own weapons and stuff. Their storylines were great too, like Dreamer's caning, the Sandman and Dreamer feud, the Dreamer and Raven feud and so on. How they didn't lie to the fans or treat them like idiots, for example when Sabu no showed and got fired on the spot in the ring. But yeah I can understand why people still prefer WWE's ECW compared to Raw and Smackdown, the thing with me though is that I enjy all three for totally different reasons so I can't actually pick a favourite out of them.

Yeah things are looking good for RoH now, it's just I haven't a clue how to see it now with The Wrestling Channel/Fight Network closing down and I could have got DVDs or tapes from ECUK, the wrestling shop in Manchester but that closed too so I dunno how I'll see the new stuff. I'd love to sit through five hours of RoH lol, it sounds like great fun! If it grew into an alternative to WWE that would be amazing, TNA is quite bad actually but it does have some good things in it, guys like AJ, Kurt and the Main Event Mafia sounds good and it has a great Women's Division based more on wrestling talent and The Beautiful People are awesome too lol.

This is the best film ive ever seen. It just gets you with so many emotions- one minute your shocked, the next your laughing and the next you want to cry. Great film.

For the guys mentioning wrestlers: R Truth was in there too.

Also i really want to stress this film is not only for fans of wrestling. My girlfriend hates wrestling but at some points during the film she was in tears (Due to emotional involvment in the film rather than me making her watch it!). I cant reccomend it enough.

I just don't get the enormous hype about this movie. Yes, it's beautifully shot and it's a wonderful performance from Rourke, but beyond that...what is it? Are those two things truly enough to elevate it above any other by-the-numbers sports underdog movie? Not really, no...and after the underrated brilliance of The Fountain, and the harsh, unrelenting commentary of Requiem for a Dream, it was something of a disappointment from Aronofsky...

Though it is very true that Rourke should've won the Oscar over Penn...

It's not really a sports underdog movie though. It's much deeper, and imo the wrestling is just a convenient (and rather apt) vehicle to depict Randy's escaping from the harsh realities of his life. I was completely hooked by Rourke's performance, and I'd never really been a fan of his- I never liked him in Angel-Heart even. Tomei (sic?) was also worthy of her Oscar nomination.

It seems that the Oscar has a soft spot for actors who play real characters, and the SAG awards are a good indicator of who turns out with the goods in the Oscars. Anyway, if it was up to me I'd choose Rourke, but Penn played with a type of effortless consistency that just had to be commended.

Well ive got a return to London for £4. But I touched lucky, on the day you'll pay £60 return, but in advance £22 return.

Chav reputation is out of the city centre, so if its just for uni you wont see it, if you venture out there are nice places too, like anywhere.
Toxteth riots, everywhere has a history, but its precisely that, history.

Toxteth is where my auntie Michelle lives and her kids are right little c**ts. The city centre is fine.

Liverpool is as safe as any city (assuming you're not walking around acting like a shaft) and from personal experience much safer than London:

Really?!??! What part of Birmingham do u live in? I genuinely don't know of one person who would like to live in Birmingham when they're older-everyone wants to move out.

Hey maybe with the investment it will get better, but right now it's grey, got no identity/atmosphere, is really "ghetto" in places (although i'm sure that's the case elsewhere in big cities so i'm not saying that specific to Bham) and basically seems to have all the bad things that London has, but none of the good.

nnnyeah - the people drawing these lists up generally include greater london (as the city of london proper is tiny) but do not include the boroughs of greater manchester making up the conurbation which is obviously bigger than some of the cities ranked above it if you actually go and eyeball these places.

for uni I'd always suggest going for a city near a river (or on a slope) as it makes it easier to find your way home drunk. sorry brum <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>

Liverpool is as safe as any other city, provided you use common sense.

Toxteth and Wavertree are the same distance away from town (in fact Toccy is on one side of Smithdown and Wavertree is on the other). Toxteth used to be dangerous, but it's cleaned up it's rep a bit.

Smithdown Road area is a typical inner city area, rows of terraced houses and shops, it's on a bus route that gets a bus towards the Uni about every 6/7 minutes. The only reason students live there is it's the student part of town (like Selly Oak in Birmingham, Fallowfield in Manchester or Kelvinhall in Glasgow)

Back onto topic, my favourite of the three is Liverpool, think it got into my blood while I was a student there, to the extent, I work nearby and will be moving back over there in a matter of weeks <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Why did you leave Manchester off that list?

Liverpool and Manchester are both excellent, I'm from Manc myself but have lived in Liverpool for 3 years for uni. It's not dangerous, I've had no trouble whatsoever.

</quote>

why did i leave manchester off the list. same reason as left newcastle and bristol off list: lack of space.

i went for liverpool: as most happening/partying place - although obviously madchester makes a claim for that too. but the scousers also have the maritime history.

went for sheffield because known to be very friendly and close to the countryside.

went for brum because at 1 million-ish, much bigger than others: i think leeds is about 3/4 million, sheffield 1/2 million, rest smaller.

Really?!??! What part of Birmingham do u live in? I genuinely don't know of one person who would like to live in Birmingham when they're older-everyone wants to move out.

Hey maybe with the investment it will get better, but right now it's grey, got no identity/atmosphere, is really "ghetto" in places (although i'm sure that's the case elsewhere in big cities so i'm not saying that specific to Bham) and basically seems to have all the bad things that London has, but none of the good.

I live in Edgbaston but regularly visit other place in B'ham and although some parts are pretty dull i would have no qualm about entering those certain areas whereas with Manchester/Liverpol there is defintely a number of areas i wouldn't even dare enter. You are entitled to your opinion but i truly believe after London, Birmingham is the best city in England.

crime is an intersting point. some say brum is dangerous because many different nationalities/ethnicities and all fighting over turf. so i was thinking liverpool being full of mainly pure bred scousers might be safer.

There is no turf war in Birmingham that i know off apart from the usual drug related problems but those that are involved target specific people rather than innocent bystanders nothing at all compared to Londons postcode problem. Most of the nationalities get on perfectly fine with very little hostility ever shown. For some reason a great deal of people from outside the city make up their own pre -conceived negative opinions about the city without ever visiting it.

Ok so Sheffield is about 1.5 hours from London on the train these days, and in some ways I think it's the best city in England. However, 50% of the city is in the ****. Completely messed up, uncared for, and working class without the once-prevalent coal and steel industry. So, in that respect, I think Sheffield has bad press. BUT it's completely underrated..

i really only know west and central sheffield. so the industrial bit not so knowledgeable about, but i imagine it is as you say a bit rubbish.

Are you asking us which city is the 'best'? Each city has its own appeal but it really depends on what appeals most to you. Manchester is more 'happening' than Liverpool, trust me, and it has a better club scene. Liverpool has maritime history, Manchester has industrial history.

you are a true brummie. stout in defence of your city. ozzy would be proud of you!
it's a tricky thing comparing cities, because few people have experience of many cities. easy to get an idea of london, because yes plenty of folk have lived there and in other cities too. but the provincial cities are not so well known, understood. so as you say many judgements are passed on the basis of few facts.

ahh, that's interesting. so if we split brum in half, north and south and looked at the south.
the new city South Brum, still big, half a million folk (i've made it an even split): now does this city start to look good in comparison with sheffield (also half a million) and liverpool (a shade under half a million)?
South Brum is it less multiculutural, less known for grey housing and few parks? i guess edgbaston introduces some greenery.

The docks is easily the nicest part of Liverpool. Sometimes the Navy will roll into town which never happens in Manchester. <img src="images/smilies/colone.gif"/> And yep, the Georgian/Edwardian houses are very pretty - the Uni of Liverpool owns many of them, I have lectures in a converted Georgian terrace. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/awesome.gif" alt=":awesome:"/>

However, "the Beatles" gets old, very quick. Shell suits? I haven't seen any. But I have seen girls out shopping with rollers in their hair.

I love both cities for different reasons but there's far more stuff to do in Liverpool than Sheffield; it's more dynamic, a bigger sense of community culture, better nightlife/shopping/commercial side, better architecture. And yes, I've lived in both so I can speak for both.

I don't like Manchester as to put it bluntly, and to quote Jamie from this years Apprentice, "It's like London but 10 years behind." It's big and sprawling but not in a good way. It's got loads of nice theatres and stuff, but it doesn't have the same sense of distinct individuality Liverpool or even Sheffield has and the general consensus of the people is far more 'conservative' than London.

Pretty much all British city centres are passable these days - they're all basically singing from the same hymnsheet of gentrified middle class housing and new identikit shopping centres with the same stores.

Complete rubbish. Some inner-city areas are awful, but not the majority as you seem to be suggesting. There are some really nice and highly desirable areas surrounding the city, and I'm not even talking about in the extremities of Liverpool suburbia: Childwall, Allerton, Mossley Hill, Aigburth... The boarded up house of Edge Lane and the not-so-recent shooting in Norris Green isn't all Liverpool's inner-city has to offer. The city centre itself you obviously haven't visited or visited without a chip on your shoulder to realise it definitely isn't 'singing from the same hymn sheet' as most other cities. It's more characteristically unique than any other city I've been to.

hey purplemonkey, you seem to know what you're talking about. i know sheffield well, and it is a bit boring - but feels nice and safe. whereas liverpool seems more interesting, but perhaps more dangerous. do you know what wavertree is like? round those roads with "dale" in them, weardale etc. the architecture of liverpool suburbs is markedly better than sheffield: lots of gorgeous double bayed victorian terraces.

</quote>

Selly Oak is densely populated by students, basically after first year everyone lives there.
It's not exactly nice, but it's so studenty that people don't really care.
Take away galore, always open til like 4/5 in the morning. Good several pubs and bars, great for pub golf, or just a pub meal.
Train station right there, big Sainsburys, as well as a Tesco 24 hour metro petrol station, council pool and gym with sauna (students can use for free).

The University is technically in Edgbaston, campus is actually lovely.
But Edgbaston is not the only posh bit thanks!
Harborne is where it's at, which is the opposite side of campus to Selly Oak.
[So Selly Oak is South, Edgbaston is east and Harborne North.]
It's the nearest High Street; Waitrose, M&amp;S, WHSmiths, Clintons, Cafe Rouge, Cafe Nero, etc. Harborne is famous for its 'Harborne Mile', something like 10 pubs in a row. Much more sophisticated than Selly Oak.

I don't like how you're attaching 'poverty' to the rest of it. Every big city has its scuzzy bits. The City Centre is pretty good. Broad Street has like 15 'clubs' on it, alternative scene in Digbeth, there is a gay quarter, chinese quarter and of course the Bullring.
Solihul is just outside it and is very nice, but I suppose isn't actually technically Birmingham.
As for the scuzzy bits, surely you won't ever need to go there?!

Agreed, also all the run down areas are part of the regeneration anyway. The houses on Edge Lane have pretty much all been knocked down now. Liverpool has nicer subarban areas than most cities, Allerton and Aigburth are really nice and pretty expensive. Even Toxteth and such are starting to be alright.

Every city has crime, there really is no way of getting away from it.

Liverpool is amazing!

Coming from near Liverpool I know quite a bit about the place... There are fantastic Edwardian houses for uni students, great bars to visit and a great atmosphere on a night out. Avoid Bootle (the people will drive anyone insane).

Otherwise the docks are indeed the best place to be, very chilled place

Theres a few more than 10 pubs in the Harborne run if you do it properly. A few gems tucked away round the side streets and a lovely little one by st Peters church.

People from Solihull get really arsey if you say its part of Brum, quite posh round most parts (apart from Chelmsley) but it gets a bit lairy at night. Sutton Coldfield is a good night out too which is about 10 mins from New street on the train.

Societies? That's one that everyone struggles with at first. It's just a thread where you get a group of people all talking about 1 thing, like a particular tv programme or university subject or football team. Once you get enough regular posters you can apply for it to be made into an official society, where you can accept and reject members applications to join. When it's official you'll find it on the <a href="http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/socs.php">societies list</a>. It's normally best to check the list before trying to start your own society. But yeah, there are societies for everything you can think of and they're good places to make friends. Click "My Societies" on any persons post to see which ones they are a member of.

Any more questions? <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Yes, Munich is really nice. If I'm rejected by Oxford, I'll study either in Edinburgh or in Munich. The two unis in Munich (TUM and LMU) are actually two of the three best unis in Germany. What is it about Germany that you like so much? <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Hmmm what do I like about Germany... welll I could tell you everything but then the list would go on forever.. lets seee... main points. The forests of Bayern are beautiful, the cities are so incredible a contrast of old and new, so much history, awesome mass transit system (the ICE rocks), seemingly unfriendly people but they are actually really nice once you get to know them, the really nice cars, so little pollution... I could go on forever. <img src="images/smilies/wink.png"/> But I won't because I don't want to bore people too much.
Overall it's just so different and far more incredible (culturally) than New Zealand.

Its a lot harder than most people on TSR think, apart from the EU of course. The most likely way is if you have family links ideally parents, or if you marry someone from abroad.

Otherwise you will need to be in a shortage job, healthcare, engineering, teaching etc, or get a few years experience and a professional qualification in something respected eg the ACA or an Actuaries qualification. Even then, it is easier to get temporary work visas than emigrate straight away (if you've been in the country a while on temporary work visas then you might be able to apply for residency).

I hear a lot of students saying its so hard to find a job in the UK, they're going to move abroad and work, I think they misunderstand the difficulties of satisfying the criteria for emigration. Other countries aren't desperately in need of an inexperienced UK graduate who can't find a job in the UK.

Not saying it can't happen, and people do do it, just that in general people underestimate how difficult it is to go, especially to the popular countries like USA, Australia, Switzerland and the Gulf states. More realistic options are Canada and New Zealand, if you are a teacher or accountant etc then there will probably be options but you will need a couple of years experience in the UK first.

The issue there is not the passport but getting a job as France has quite high unemployment especially youth unemployment. Obviously you would need to be bilingual as well as France isn't one of those countries where you could get by on just speaking English. If you are a bilingual engineer then France might be a viable option but again for the average UK graduate who only speaks English and got a 2:1 in a non job related degree, finding a career job in France (as opposed to a ski chalet type job) is going to be very difficult.

Yes - I think a lot of people have failed to see how hard it is to emmigrate* anywhere.

As someone who has been lucky enough to manage the first step to emmigration even the 'easiest' routes aren't easy.

*I mean properly emmigrate - as in permanently settle in another country. I'm not counting living and working in an EU country when you have an EU passport. If, however, you wanted to gain citizenship of that other country, that counts.

If you are a bilingual engineer then France might be a viable option but again for the average UK graduate who only speaks English and got a 2:1 in a non job related degree, finding a career job in France (as opposed to a ski chalet type job) is going to be very difficult.

Best answer for this came from my former uni flatmate who reckons that the UK will end up under Shariah law before long because of the 'pc idiots' allowing too many Muslims over here, he said he was going to leave the UK when he'd graduated, I asked where, he said one of the Gulf Arab states where you don't have to pay tax.

Don't be ridiculous.

The US will take in about $4.5 trillion in tax this year. The cost of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan for FY2011 will be around $159.3 billion; Libya has so far cost a tad less than a billion.

$160 billion is about 3.5% of $4.5 trillion.

I've lived in France too for a bit, which was great (although I was 5 and 6 so I might have had rose tinted spectacles)

I don't see the fuss about the U.S. either. Yes, there are some exciting places like NYC or San Francisco, but all in all most places are filled with some very conservative, Jesus-obsessed, extremely patriotic (ignorant) people. The cities are not that attractive either. You have to drive literally everywhere and some neighbourhoods don't even have sidewalks. The poverty rate is very high and you see a lot more homeless people there than in Europe generally. I've stayed with four families and none of them were trying to be energy efficient. They did not recycle at all and once when we left for a few days, they didn't even bother to turn off the computer. I'm also not particularly keen of the gun and hunting culture. People killing deers and then uploading pics of their 'trophys' on facebook. Please don't get me wrong, I really like the U.S. and I'm always sad to leave, but on the other hand I'm happy that I live here. I think Europeans should value their continent a bit more.

Ah yes, the Jesus freaks. I didn't come across too many of them though even though I was in a fairly urban area despite living within the Bible Belt (and it's not a strongly republican state either). They are definitely out there though, since the current Texan republican running for president believes in praying problems away.

And yeah it is a pain that you have to drive everywhere. I think the fact that most of the food in the USA is filled **** and the fact that you pretty much have to drive everywhere are the main reasons why the USA has the world's biggest obesity problem.

I've been in Japan for the past 17 months. That's not all there is. There are also very historical Samurai towns, Buddhist temples, Castles, amazing Zen gardens, parks with cherry blossoms, rivers, mountains, water falls, annual festivals, etc. Almost every market you visit has ancient historical little knick-knacks, stuff you wouldn't think to find in the U.S. or the UK.

There are so many I can think of but I don't know if anyone would agree. I like London, Paris and Boulder, CO. I'm not sure if it's a town or a city but it's lovely (and full of hipsters. We actually saw one guy sat in the street with a typewriter.)

Berlin, spent 4 months in my German teacher's flat (she wasn't there obv) and doing bar work, had a ****ing blast. The nightlife was great and the people were friendly and patient.

NYC, similar to the above I was doing menial work to support myself but still had a ball, the music scene is thriving and there are so many things to do, the conversationism isn't as good as LDN but the parks are still pretty nice.

Going to a city for a week or two isn't enough time to gauge how good it is, you have to scrape by, struggle to support yourself and search out people and entertainment in order to gain a complete experience. I had no choice because I'm from a working class background but if any of you middle class (or higher) people choose to go to another city then I implore you to spend time supporting yourself, it's fulfilling as hell.

Sydney, I have seen quite a few of the 'big' cities (New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Paris, Tokyo, London, Dubai..) and I have to say it was the most friendly, beautiful and clean of them all also seemed to be least congested and close to lovely beaches. That said there are a lot of smaller, yet great cities but I'll keep this to the big ones that everyone knows. I really like some Scandinavia's cities but they don't really register on the world map

edit- my top 5

1. Sydney
2. San Francisco
3. New York
4. London
5. Paris

I agree with almost everything you said here ( I love The Burgh!)

But seriously how does the private school thing make it a good city? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>
I personally feel that it's one of the city's bad points. Since a disproportionate amount of children (1 in 4) go to private schools in Edinburgh I think this leads to the state schools doing less well. It also means there's a lot of holier than thou private school attitude in Edinburgh.

I don't think it MAKES it a good city, its more of an indicator of one. Private schools are businesses which are dependant on customers, ie. rich folk.

In the UK; I like Edinburgh and Bristol, London is a world city but I'm not convinced it is very liveable. Outside of the UK - I love Berlin (which is hugely underrated), it has a great cultural scence, is reasonably priced, it oozes history and you will have trouble getting bored. Loads of the Scandanavian cities are liveable - but they fall short on how interesting they are to live in. In terms of being seats of power/finance - NYC, Paris, Tokyo, London, Hong Kong (and increasingly Shanghai and Beijing).

Why Hangzhou in particular? Big city, but in Chinese terms just a commuter town for Shanghai... probably less smoggy though I'd imagine.

Zurich is really nice too when the weather is good; it has such fantastic countryside in the surrounding areas.

I was there in June and just found it to be sort of perfect version of the UK, clean streets (I dont remember ever seeing litter), everyone I met was very polite, warm, helpful and welcoming, public transport was amazingly well run. Lots of culture Ibsen museum and Norsk folk museum where highlights for me, beautiful parks, lovely harbour the view from frognerseteren. Every single woman was really attractive when is obviously a bonus.
The fact you can stand right outside parliament and the palace was jaw dropping when you comparing Oslo to New York and London most public buildings are like fortresses.
I'm slightly biased my girlfriend is half icelandic half norwegian so I was staying with her mothers family in Frogner so having all those people around probably swayed it for me.
Karl Johans gate is the best street in the world, I could sit drinking coffee outside the grand cafe for the rest of my life.

The whole city is just perfect in my eyes <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

It doesn't have the same wonderful reputation in Norway, but it's nice that you think that. I thought Oslo was OK, and I really like Karl Johan but I prefer Bergen (which is a beautiful city). I'm from the west coast though, and probably a little biased. Bergen is the unofficial capital of Western Norway after all. Yes, I've heard about the whole royal palace thing. I didn't know it was a little "weird" before people from other countries started commenting on it. Let's hope that Norwegian society will continue to be open and free.

This part makes me sad I was there just before the terrorism, I'm going back next year for the May 17th celebration so I hope it hasnt changed too much. There dosnt need to be all kinds of wonderous sights to make a city "the best" Oslo has some amazing ones but combining then with the open and free society makes is what makes it the best city for me.

It is sad. It was such a huge shock and 22 July feels like a distant nightmare.. Oh you're going back for 17th May? Lovely! I'm a big fan of 17th May and I love wearing my bunad. I'm going to miss walking in the children's parade, I think!

London is amazing. I've lived here for most of my life and absolutely love this city. That said there are many excellent cities in the UK such as Edinburgh, Bristol, Newcastle, Leeds and Cardiff. There's probably others that I've just not visited yet. In all the above cities, you can do many of what you can do in London and many work there.

Nope. This isn't the first time the USA has been in a debt crisis. They will simply raise the debt ceiling, and everything will be ok... more or less... for another year or two, when they'll have to do the same thing again.

It's very silly to even suggest such idiocy. US workers are some of the most efficient in the world, their productivity in the fields of Hi-tech industry and Military Equipment is unparalleled.

Unemployment is reducing as shown by the NFP (non-farm payrolls), granted there was a dip in June where Unemployment increased by 0.1%. But is expected to fall 0.2%+ in July.

Nope. This isn't the first time the USA has been in a debt crisis. They will simply raise the debt ceiling, and everything will be ok... more or less... for another year or two, when they'll have to do the same thing again.

It's very silly to even suggest such idiocy. US workers are some of the most efficient in the world, their productivity in the fields of Hi-tech industry and Military Equipment is unparalleled.

Unemployment is reducing as shown by the NFP (non-farm payrolls), granted there was a dip in June where Unemployment increased by 0.1%. But is expected to fall 0.2%+ in July.

But thats the problem.. They just keep raising the debt ceiling and not actually paying the debt back.

Its suicidal economics. The whole system is really. Take out the central reserve banks and there might be some hope yet.

Obama was basically begging the american public in his speech the other day to keep the pressure on Washington to do the right thing as the way things are another recession will hit the US in a few months...

The people in your pub also profit from you I presume. I don't see how anyone could be offended by someone offering you assistance. They can't read your mind - If you don't want assistance and are just browsing, you can politely say "No thanks, but I'll come get you if I want some help".

What's wrong with an American cashier being polite instead of being grumpy and silent? First of all, customers are more likely to return if they encountered polite, friendly staff as opposed to the unnatural and formal "Good Morning how may I help you" spiel.

Give me an example of "something real" that anyone in a British service sector has said to you.

The irony of a Brit of all countries talking about the dangers of public debt <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/lol.gif" alt=":lol:"/>

It has been the world's largest national economy since the 1870s and remains the world's largest manufacturer, representing 19% of the world's manufacturing. About 30% of the entire world's millionaire population reside in the United States. Furthermore, 34% of the world's billionaires are American. The US is also home to the world's largest stock exchange - three times the size of it's closest rival; the New York Stock Exchange. It also boasts the world's largest gold reserves and the world's largest gold depository, the New York Federal Reserve Bank. The United States is also home to 139 of the world's 500 largest companies, which is almost twice that of any other country. The US dollar holds about 60% of world reserves, as compared to its top competitor, the euro, which controls about 24%. The US is by far the most heavily invested-into country in the world, with foreign investments made in the US measuring almost $2.4 trillion, which is more than twice that of any other country. The US is also by far the largest investor in the world, with US investments in foreign countries totaling over $3.3 trillion, which is almost twice that of any other country. Also, the American population is young and growing when compared to Europe or Japan. It has <a href="http://www.energytribune.com/articles.cfm/6933/US-Has-Earths-Largest-Energy-Resources"> the world's largest energy reserves</a>, <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/top-200.html"> the world's best universities</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita"> has a GDP per capita about $10,000 higher than in the UK.</a> Where is the British Google, or the British Microsoft? I don't see much innovation coming out of the UK to be honest - don't throw stones in glass houses considering the British economy is crippled after becoming stupidly over-reliant on the financial services sector. The USA is also the biggest destination for immigrants from around the world - we absorbed about 20 million alone in the last decade.

I disagree. American girls tend to be either very fat or very hot. Most people are very ethnically mixed and everybody knows the greater the mix the hotter the person (usually) - I'm 1/4 Chinese, 1/2 Czech and 1/4 Italian for example - which adds to the attractiveness. The girls in LA for example are better than in Moscow - go to LA and you get Hispanics, Black girls, Persian girls, Chinese girls, Thai girls, Korean girls, European girls... <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/sogood.gif" alt=":sogood:"/>

Very few shop assistants are cheerful in the "have a nice day" sense. In my experience, people seem to think that employees being friendly to you is just an act, therefore everyone should be overly-serious to the point where everything becomes "Good Morning sir how may I be of assistance?" instead of the more natural "Hey, how you doing, need any help?"

What do tiny houses have to do with my post?

The people in Niqabs, etc and the people that go to African evangelical churches in London/Birmingham and don't count as the average British person (seeing as they haven't integrated) so you may as well be comparing how religious Americans are to Nigerians or Saudi Arabians (or wherever the people were from before they came to the UK).

You'd be better off seeing what average Britain is by going to places such as Edinburgh, Cardiff, Liverpool or Manchester.
The average person in the Bible Belt would definitely be more religious than the average person from somewhere in the UK that isn't Birmingham or London.

Very small? I came across plenty of people like Sarah Palin and these evangelical Christians while living in the Bible Belt, and I'm sure the number of them across the whole of the USA isn't very small, considering the amount of support the Republican party receives. I'm not saying all Americans are like that, but a lot are in the Republican/Confederate states, otherwise people like Sarah Palin and other nutjobs in the public eye like her wouldn't get as much support as they do from the people in these areas.

Yea it is strange really, when you look at the actual debt (a trillion dollars or so apparently!) and the increasing amount of debt every year, compared to such a wealthy economical superpower, the prospect of raising taxes as a definite, seems ludicrous.

But it appears to be reaching a point where the unthinkable will happen... Confidence in US dropping. Unless the political fighting can settle on something and allow the ol debt ceiling raise.

The real question should be why though... Why is the most powerful and one of the wealthiest nations in the world only able to operate on a continual basis of debt accrued.

Why? Maybe ask the Rothschilds..

Bullcrap. Hispanics are more patriotic than average - probably because they have swapped Mexico for high wages and a good standard of living. All the Mexicans I know are damn proud to be American and hispanic enlistment in the military is by far the highest out of any ethnic group.

Actually Texas And California are the US states most serious about indpendence. I don't know the exact degree of hispanic influence to them, but make of that what you will. People would have said the break of some European states was unfathomable but it happened. they said the unification of states like in the US was unfathomable in Europe but it may well happen.

Agreed. If anywhere, the UK seems more prone to ethnic disintegration given the fact that it seems incapable of providing anyone with a sense of national identity and has elected facists to represent the country at the EU.

No Hispanic apart from a few loonies is interested in seperating from the USA and from anecdotal experiance they are more patriotic than the average.

Alaska has the biggest seperatist movement by the way (and no it isn't Hispanic led).

Well the UK doesn't enforce identity, it's becaue it's too obsessed with appeasment and mjulticulturalism. I'm not convinced it's worked so much worse than the US's integration though.

Well, i'd rather have us either fully engaged in europe or out(preferably the latter), they've done neither. Halfway betwen the US and the EU was Blair's useless position. And I'd rather have us extricated from the US in foreign policy. I'm European, that's got nothing to do with my beliefs abut the EU and whether it should be a superstate. I dunno what you mean about 'special and powerful' it's nothing I've said here, although I'm a patriot yes, but your phrasing is telling, you may have a chip on your shoulder about us like many Americans do. I genuinely do believe it's this that at least partly drives some of their aggressive actions on a world stage, and love of trying to dictate to us.

Tons of them do. Going on about the Brits forcing their langauge on everyone, thinking they are better etc. In reality we are no worse than any country, just that we speak their language and theya re an ex colony therefore they hate us. And Americans have to make sure everyone hears about them much more, they offer their judgements on other places, lecture them etc, it inflate their sense of importance....some Americans don't realise how much they have wound everyone else up....you can be assured they offer plenty of opinions on everywhere. But culturally, there is some sort of problem, they are so defensive they can't even take in foreign programmes for ****s sake, without doing a remake or exhibiting mass scorn for something British.. we on the other hand are told about their anglophilia(which is crap) and how we should love all their influence and programmes, in a typically pious way. Same goes for who they undercut and dump their media products on countries. They care about cultrual imperialism, and behave like this with Britain in this regard too. The reasons countries like France are hated by the US is they don't stand for their crap in this egard or any more important one like foreign policy. Eventually more people will grow tired of it. I'm not going to get into will it break up, that was a cursory comment, but it will decline in power, it's had power short term and pissed off too many people. It is becoming isolated, maybe Britain will be too.

If you think there was anything more than mediocre interest in the royal wedding in the US at least, you are sadly and sorely deluded. Given that the event had near 24/7 coverage in the gossip media outlets, the fact that it still managed to garner less viewers than a weekly broadcast of an American Idol episode, tells you all you need to know. Aside from a pathetic BBC article on the matter (pathetic because it had no polls/data or sources other than this one, yes one, American women interested in the wedding and who then formed the base interest of everyone in America), no one gave a crap about it this side of the pond anyways <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

Exactly. For the record I hate all the royal **** and I get it down my throat here.

While you are bickering, some people would point out that the Texas is not "the South" if we wanted to be pedantic, in the same way that Florida is not "the South". Culturally and historically it is completely different and needless to say it wasn't even part of the US until 1845.

Evidence for any of your claims? None <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

You also mentioned their being descent in Texas (or rather people wanting to separate), again with NO EVIDENCE whatsoever and indeed when exactly the opposite is true. So you made an utterly false and moronic claim, without any shred of evidence to back it up, and your idiocy was then put out in the open and question. Its not my fault you talk out of your arse frankly.

Moreover, the US is not the EU; for example unlike the EU (where one is German/French/British etc first and then a European), in the US you are American first and then if at all, a member of your state. Ergo, stop with your ridiculous and nonsensical false equivalencies on the separation of states, when you are dealing with two different beasts altogether.

It's attitudinal, part of a wider trend. It's one way often, and the US is in a more myopic position. So inevitably they irritate people. They do that by undercutting stuff, there's no option for poor countries, smaller countries. It's part of cultural imperialism, soft power, but more broadly there is a genuinely lecturing and condescending attitude to the world. Claims to the moral high ground which they have no basis for. There are things which combine, foreign policy too, and it may turn back on the US evnetually. Like I say, it's short term power and I'm not convinced how it will last in it's present state, them being the way they are.

If we wanted to be more serious, during my time in the New England states, there's definitely a certain distrust of the British that probably remains. Despite a lot of people in Boston wanting to claim that they are descendants of the Cabots or some other Pilgrim family (unless they're bending your ear about how Irish they are because their Great-Great Grandfather came from Galway and so the fact that they're 1/16th Irish makes them pretty much Irish despite the fact that they watch Hockey and drink Samuel Adams), there's definitely an underlying distrust of the British because people are not too sure how to relate to them. In the North East, there's nothing "exotic" about being British. Most people will have met a few Brits during their life. While living there, I would usually not be questioned where I was from as much as you'd think. You'll even meet quite a few lecturers, staff in some companies who are British and are now settled there.

It's only once you get to the Midwest or the South where some people will literally have never met a British person that the view is more of interest.

I think you're missing the point...

"The South" is not the same as the Southern part of the US. It's a cultural term. It usually starts from North Carolina (although some people refer to Virginia as the start of the South as it is itself quite distinct culturally from New York state) and stops at Florida to the South, Texas to the West and the area that used to be Louisiana to the West.

Those states are characterised by a large number of people of mostly British and German and African ancestry, essentially due to the fact that they had huge plantations.

The whole concept of "Soul food" or Grits for example is pretty much limited to these states.

Florida and Texas have their own history that is entirely separate from the South, having been separate countries with predominately Hispanic links (although the settlers were not necessarily of Spanish ancestry in the case of Texas for example).

And in terms of tourists, yes there is less drunkeness in Americans, they are more puritannical(though I'm scpetical about how much less yobbishness there is in Americans). Americans offer a differing form of arrogance and rudeness, it's lecturing, condescesion, treating people beneath them. Fake politeness that contains condescension and criticism. Everyone knows what I mean, because many Europeans have had it. The American from of obnoxiousness stems from superioirty, the British and especially one stems from anger from their positon in the world. We get criticism and self-righteousness from a lot of directions that is not warranted. And when many people come here after a while they really like it. I know many French people who love it here and don't want to go back.

Not everyone in New England is of Irish ancestry, far from it and even among those of Irish ancestry, not all are supporters of the IRA... but yes, it would be quite disturbing living in Boston and seeing some bumper stickers in support of the IRA and noone actually contesting that. I'd also sometimes be given a hard time by a drunk tramp, when hearing that I'm British (and not Australian as he thought) shouting "Free Ireland. Long live the IRA". I kid you not. And it happened 3 times in the space of a year.

It's like everything but among Americans, if they've got nothing interesting going for them, they emphasize something like the fact that they are Irish-American or Polish-American just because they were told that their Great Great Grandmother was from Ireland or Poland. When you're a boring white American fart who's pretty much like everyone else, you grasp onto that idea rather than having to say: well I'm probably French/English/Scottish/German/Native American/Polish like every boring white American.

You'd actually be surprised by the number of people in the US who are of Native American ancestry but who hide it out of embarassment.

Dude.

Look, I already said there are yobs an 18-30 etc, drinking culture I admit it. Taht is a minority, most people just have a few pints and a laugh, don't even do drugs. Maybe not just American tourist but American generally are disliked, as I said in an entirely different way. Yes, they have more apparent 'civilisation', but they are overbearing in a different way. As I say anyone, will know what I mean by the rigtheousnes, browbeating zeal regards issues like politics, foreing policy with Americans or any argument, that's why they are disliked in other ways. And again, there is not the yobbishness but plenty of treating people like crap from Americans. A lot of Europeans, but mainly Brits and Irish who I've known, who go over there will say how they dislike it becuase of the way they treat waiters etc. And yeah, it's location specific. If you're going to Xante or Ayia Napa, or Mallorca you'll get chavs. If you go to somewhere like Provence, or Brittany, you won't.

That's not specific to British tourists. The trouble is that there are so many British tourists out there. Whereas only the rich privileged travel abroad from a lot of countries, travelling abroad has been pretty much open to the whole population and is engrained in British culture. So even the complete morons that you refer to manage to travel but they're actually a small percentage of British tourists overall.

Whereas going on holiday to Florida is something that even the poorer and uneducated people of this country do, simiar people from other European countries wouldn't dream of doing it. It's also because British people spend a lot of money on travel compared to their income.

It also depends which countries you actually visit. If you go to South East Asia, people won't have much of a view of British tourists and will especially complain about the Aussies.

But yes, I ****ing hate the type of British tourist you refer to and steer well clear of them. Usually it's just guys who think that somehow shouting in the street and getting pissed with your mates will avoid people realising that you're not a "real man".

Go to the Baltics and before people complain about the British, they complain about the Finns (and you're probably thinking "the Finns?"...) They're far bigger binge-drinkers than the British but there are far fewer of them too and they probably don't venture out on lad weekends to the places you go to).

Not everyone in New England is of Irish ancestry, far from it and even among those of Irish ancestry, not all are supporters of the IRA... but yes, it would be quite disturbing living in Boston and seeing some bumper stickers in support of the IRA and noone actually contesting that. I'd also sometimes be given a hard time by a drunk tramp, when hearing that I'm British (and not Australian as he thought) shouting "Free Ireland. Long live the IRA". I kid you not. And it happened 3 times in the space of a year.

It's like everything but among Americans, if they've got nothing interesting going for them, they emphasize something like the fact that they are Irish-American or Polish-American just because they were told that their Great Great Grandmother was from Ireland or Poland. When you're a boring white American fart who's pretty much like everyone else, you grasp onto that idea rather than having to say: well I'm probably French/English/Scottish/German/Native American/Polish like every boring white American.

You'd actually be surprised by the number of people in the US who are of Native American ancestry but who hide it out of embarassment.

You are generalizing again - not all british tourists are like the ones you describe and not all other tourists show perfect behavior either. FWIW we are, not hated, but not liked (collectively) either in a lot of muslim countries. There can be real issues at immigration when showing your american passport.

Yes, I would definitely compare the New England connection to that of the Aussie one: it's because some people there don't quite know how to relate to the "mother country", yet they still feel quite close, that the relationship is very much love/hate. Of course, in Minnesota, noone sees the UK as any form of mother country, whereas when you're in New England, every cultural place you visit refers to the first settlers who were mostly British.

I've actually found that the less ethnic/cultural ties an American has with the UK, the more anglophile they're likely to be. I was actually amazed by the number of African Americans (ok, someone might point out that being African American probably means some form of European ancestry) who were quite interested in the UK, London etc. It's when those ties are fairly strong, that they don't know how to relate.

I've heard that the support for the IRA has calmed down with people in the US understanding a bit more about the situation.

As for the French being more important: surely you're not referring to that ridiculous comment from Obama that was misinterpreted.

The thing with the US is that a lot of European countries vye for the privilege to be called the special partner but the fact is the US has special partnerships with everyone. The UK should accept that they're behind the political creation of the US and that the majority (for now) of the US speak English and that because of that, there have been strong cultural ties over the years. That will always make the UK important to a certain extent but it most certainly doesn't suggest any form of exclusive relationship. Of course France or Spain or even Ireland will want to stake a claim to being important partners but those countries were also very important in the formation of the US. We were just referring to Texas and Florida who have no historical ties with the British but strong ones with Spain (and France). Louisiana used to take up something like a 1/3 of the US territory and was owned (at least, according to a political claim, noone actually lived there) by the French. Large parts of New England are also quite influenced by the arrival of French-speaking Canadians in the 19th century who were looking for work.

In the case of France, the ties are pretty weak: other than historical (they had a claim over Louisiana but considering that the territory was virtually uninhabited except towards the South with Acadians and obviously the French won the American Revolution for them), not that many people are of French ancestry and because, like the British, the settlers from France arrived such a long time ago, few Americans actually are aware of the ancestry and few have any cultural link. Even in Louisiana, Cajun French is a dying language and is a language that developed independently, in cultural isolation from metropolitan French.

Dunno. I was talking to a bar owner from Prague a few weeks ago! and he said that the local people used to have a high regard for British people until the stag crews and cheap flight crews moved in. Now they have nothing but contempt for the brits who go over to Prague. He's almost been stabbed twice by a drunk up jerk and he says that the beautiful city centre is full of vomiting, disrespectful groups trying to molest the local women and causing mayhem. I've also flown back from Prague and Bratislava and the scum you find on the aircraft is breathtaking. Swearing amongst themslevs, talking loudly about sexual exploits. It makes me sick to be honest. The money they spend doesn't really do much for the local economy as all they spend money on is bars, prostitutes and cheap hotels. Maybe the increase in air fares will put these sort of people off travelling and that is a good thing. Go to a British city centre on a Friday and Saturday night and the place is like a warzone. Is it possible to go out on a Friday night in a town/city with a population of at least 300,000 and not feel threatened in any way? Are there some charming places that haven't been permeated by the stench of booze-fuelled violence? If so, where are they?

But why do they want to be the partner? It's not a benefit, our politicians and some of our public just seem to think it's good to have no regard for our heritage and sell us out. Whether it offends some on this thread I don't care, the guy from Pittsburgh is being more balanced- but many Europeans who are proud of their countries have a right to feel aggrieved when they get lectured and told how to be by the yanks, treated with contempt, and our politicians and some of our fellow countrymen seem to just pathetically reinforce this. There is an added frustation in the English, in that we see ourselves as perfectly decent, yet our surrounded by countries like Ireland, Scotland and Europe who hate us, and of course our ex-colonies becuase of history. There's an interesting book by AA Gill when he say that the english are driven primarily by anger, and behave like a spurned lover to Europe. We are certainly odd in our position and psyche.
I always thought it was black people in this country lookingto African American culture, which was a shame because they were better integrated, their is an issue with glamourising being the oppressed, gang and gun culture etc. I guess African Americans just see a different way that Black Brits fit in and are interested by it.

Indeed. Not something that that many people realise until they travel to the less typical tourist spots where Scandinavians are more present. They don't drink and get loud. They tend to drink, get loud and drink until they pass out.

Scandinavians tend to be even worse when abroad when they "let their hair down": Huge binge drinkers but not necessarily yobbish like some British tourists can be, but they can be just as much a nuisance.

Yeah when I was comparing the New England connection to the Aussie connection, I should have pointed out that in the latter, the ties are far more significant and strong with a lot of British people (such as yourself and I) having Australian relatives. In New England, far fewer people have relatives in the UK. It's more that a lot of the local culture refers back to Britain.

What I have found in the case of the Aussie cultural identity crisis, is that a lot of Australians want to have an identity that doesn't have those ties to Britain, a flag that looks like "Britain at night" (as Jerry Seinfeld would say), but then don't know what to replace these cultural elements with.
They often replace it with some weird Americanophilia that hardly provides them with any stronger identity.

Yes, I did say that I recognise that it's not obvious.

However, far more British people would know about the regions of Spain than Americans would do.

It would be a lot simpler if the UK was actually officially a federation or confederation which it mostly definitely isn't, despite a lot of people viewing the UK that way. It's actually quite a highly centralised state but with territories have a special status, very very similarly to Spain.

However in the case of Spain, people rarely need to refer to the constituent regions. You'd still piss off someone from Barcelona if you said you were looking for bull-fighting and flamenco there.

Crime-ridden? Crime in NYC is pretty much at an all-time low. Ex-Mayor Bloomberg's tactics to reduce crime in the city were world famous, and are still used today as case studies in how inner-city crime should be delt with...

As for the overcrowded bit, of course a mega-city might feel a bit claustrophobic to someone used to the countryside, but in relative terms I definitely would not call NYC overcrowded.

And how can you dismiss the immeasurable number of cultures found in Cali and NYC? lol

Far-right wing parties have very little support in the UK, although they make a lot of noise, mainly because they are completely out of the mainstream of politics, unlike in other European countries.

By and large, the UK is one of the least racist European countries. Yes it's a very subjective statement, based on personal observations but in general, the British are not attached to the idea of being "white" in the way that other European countries are.
This might sound like a ridiculously controversial statement but a white girl telling her parents she wants to marry a black guy does not spark the same reaction in a typical UK family as it does in many other European countries I've lived in.

Slavery was just as prevalent in the North in the 19th Century. Yet, few people seem to criticize them.

Now we're not discussing life in the 19th Century, we're talking about life there today. And, in the South, there is a very calm, laid-back atmosphere. Generally, people are more friendly than in the North.

Texas doesn't even have an income tax, yet it's residents have a brilliant quality of life that far surpasses NYC.

Sure, there would be competition in the labour market, but that doesn't mean that they would go as far as supporting slavery to prevent it. Think this through logically - Black people being allowed jobs in Britain means you face competition, does that therefore mean that you support slavery? No.

The average Southerner desired Liberty, and they fought a war for it. They didn't want a hostile North forcing their way of life on the independent Southerners. Blacks and Whites fought side by side in this war. It may interest you to know that General Lee freed all his slaves before the start of the Civil War.

Yes, slavery was prevelant in the north in the 19th century, but from around 1915 onwards the northern states became a lot more progressive when it came to civil rights. That's why so many blacks migrated northwards during the 20th century ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_%28African_American%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_M...an_American%29</a> ). Of course they still faced a lot of discrimination in the north, but is was much better than living in slavery back in the south (although slavery had been abolished on paper, millions of blacks were still kept on plantations in the south, supposedly working off "debts" to the owners).

But I don't want to get into any more history discussions - what I was trying to say (although I did delete my original comment because I was generalising) was that much of the rural south today is still very conservative and hostile to immigrants and non-whites as a result of the influence of its recent history.

I can acknowledge that life in the South could be more laid-back and relaxed, but the same could be said of many regions in California and New York State. NYC on the other hand is an international mega-city - life is fast-paced there but it suits a lot of people (myself included). It's a matter of preference.

If you could provide me with a link of Texan QoL then that would be great. Comparing an entire state to a city is pretty unfair given the existence of regional disparities - life in Houston is going to be pretty different to life in a Texan rural village.

You have a point, but it falls down when you factor in the different time periods. An unskilled poor white man in 19th century Texas is going to have a different mindset to an unskilled poor white man in 21st century England. The 19th century dude has no social-safety nets for unemployment, and if he does see his wages fall then him and his family are going to starve. Labour mobility and flexibility is non-existent and it is a social norm to openly persecute and discriminate against blacks. Of course the guy is going to have no problem with supporting slavery.

On the other hand you've got the 21st century guy - minimum wage legislation is in place and if he becomes unemployed then he will get unemployment benefits. Labour mobility and flexibility is existent in the form of extra-training, education and public transport. It also happens to be that open discrimination and persecution of black people is outlawed, and also against social norms. Of course the guy is not going to support slavery based on the fact that he will face increased competition in the labour market. He may grumble about it, or if he's in an extremist minority he may join the BNP, but it'll stop there.

The "bible belt" as you call it suffers relentless abuse from atheists who call it all manner of things, including "backwards". The people living in the "bible belt" are very friendly (It is one of the teachings of their religion). Religion and human advancement can and do go hand in hand all the time. Galileo for instance, was a devout Catholic as well as a scientist. A society that holds religion in high regard is not backwards. In fact, it is the societies who that seek to persecute the presence of religion in society that are backwards.

Yeah when I was comparing the New England connection to the Aussie connection, I should have pointed out that in the latter, the ties are far more significant and strong with a lot of British people (such as yourself and I) having Australian relatives. In New England, far fewer people have relatives in the UK. It's more that a lot of the local culture refers back to Britain.

What I have found in the case of the Aussie cultural identity crisis, is that a lot of Australians want to have an identity that doesn't have those ties to Britain, a flag that looks like "Britain at night" (as Jerry Seinfeld would say), but then don't know what to replace these cultural elements with.
They often replace it with some weird Americanophilia that hardly provides them with any stronger identity.

My Dad was talking about Fremantle near Perth out there, how they have tons of Irish pubs and music. Curious about the Irish link too as I think man y Irish are stil going over there through their economic woes. Australia's economy seems more tied to the east and independent of these issues. For my money, might be speculation, but it seems like Australia has less identity no and is more americanised and globalised. It seems less Brtish in feel, but like I say, only an inlking I get.

Yeah, as i was saying earlier. Some Americans might not like the stat, but the surveys on mixed marriages, attitudes to evolution, creationism etc show it all. It deoes exhibit backward attitudes. Despite some of the liberal media always wanting to paint Britain as unccultured yobs and the continent as cultured, there is a different picture. Le Pen got a third of the vote in France, and Boris Becker having a black partner and kids with her was a big deal to Germans. I've had my own doubts about immigration but at the ends of the day, we saw with fascism and the war, we see with religion, that the UK, particularly the English, just do not take to fervent ideologies, be they religious, racial or anything else. There are a small amount of lazy resentments, but that's more to do with indgenous people feeling unfairly treated and displaced, than any real serious issue about race. Ultimately there is something to fervent, and earnest about stuff like that to catch on here. We are fundamentally quite tolerant and forward looking I think.

One guy's blog is clear proof that America's turning into a dump, n'est-ce pas?

Judging whether the USA is a dump is entirely up to where you visit in my opinion. Some parts of America have of one of the most beautiful scenery and neighborhoods in the world, other places just an hours drive away though could just look like ghost towns.

These two places are both located in the same state California. You can just see what I mean about how much these two places differ in terms of what is a dump in the USA and what's not.

Err, California isn't a small state! Surely you can say that about just about any vaguely capitalist society. There are rich areas and poor areas. The divide between rich and poor in the US is (admittedly) greater than that of england, but overall I think the wealth per person is higher in the US.

What kind of privacy do you need? Do you masturbate fully naked in your garden or something? Perhaps you torture and murder people in your house and need to keep the screams away from the neighbours.

I have relatives in LA who live in Tehrangeles (the Iranian-American part of LA) and it is a great place to live. America is many ways a huge land of opportunity (one in three Iranian Americans earns over $100K) and if you live around the metro areas of places like Boston or Portland or Chicago or LA it is an amazing standard of living. My family work normal middle class lives and live in a huge house that only millionaires could afford in the UK with swimming pools, loads of land and so on. They have a short drive to the centre of LA, a short drive to things like the tennis club, short drive to the coast and a short drive to the hills and mountains and rural areas around the city - as much as I love Edinburgh - California is something special.

What the hell, you can't be serious. Tell us exactly what makes you think it is anything like a "dump wasteland"?

If anything, the first picture (all those houses bunched together) looked more of a wasteland than the next two photos.

Based on the pictures alone, it looks like a reasonably spacious place to live. The houses show no signs of damage, there's plenty of room, there's good transport etc.

The American constitution has no relevance for the United Kingdom. The concepts the constitution guards are fine enough, but it itself is a ridiculous and dogmatic approach to guaranteeing the rule of law and the freedoms of the people. Here in the UK our constitution is very malleable and is comprised of a series of documents from the past 800 years that can be added to freely, and consequently we don't get cries of "OMG THAT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL" every time some new bill is presented to the House of Commons. It's worked pretty well so far.

Furthermore, the Americas hadn't even been discovered whilst the English were passing the Magna Carta, and the colonies were a backwater when our Bill of Rights was passed.

Statute law which sets out the limitations of government is not "ridiculous". The founding fathers were smart enough to know that if Government was the supreme law-maker, then a corrupt government would simply alter the law to make tyranny legal. To prevent this, they set out very clearly what Governments can and can't do. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, not the Federal Government. If there is ever a conflict, the Constitution takes priority.

The Constitution is an inanimate object, and therefore cannot be a physical safeguard against infringements. That's where the 2nd Amendment comes in. If the Government does not abide by the Constitution, it is illegitimate and the citizens have both the right and duty to "throw off such Government" as stated in the Declaration of Independence.

If a bill came into the house of commons tomorrow proposing the outlaw of freedom of speech, there would indeed by cries of "that's unconstitutional".

I'm finding it very difficult to remain polite with you, because a lot of people have died defending the Constitution. You don't seem to have worked out that without the concept of freedom of speech, you wouldn't have been allowed to post what you just did.

Seriously though, just because people earn high incomes in the city doesn't mean that they are money-grabbing misers with no personality. Quite the opposite in fact. Also, if you want a relaxed lifestyle, you can make it for yourself - location is a big factor yes, but it isn't the be all and end all. NYC is really close to a load of awesome places where you can relax - Long Island, Jersey Shore etc

Given the choice, I'd holiday in the South. You'd holiday in the North, because you have misconceptions about the South. I really don't see what else is left to say on the subject.

Ummm, I don't holiday in the North because I don't want to holiday in the South - I holiday in certain places because I want to go there, not because it's somewhere different to where I don't want to go.

Spend a day in Houston, and a day in NYC. Broadly speaking, you'll be treated with better courtesy in the South than in the North. This is due to the different cultures, I've already explained there's more of a relaxed culture in the South. You have to be careful not to generalize too much, but broadly speaking places like NYC have what can only be described as an "office culture". People take their office job far too seriously, often to the point where it negatively affects their life in the community, and their attitude towards others. For instance, they will neglect their duty towards others in order to spend more time working towards a target. In the South, people recognize you have other responsibilities, such as the responsibility to your family, and responsibility to the community, and not just to the person who writes your paycheck.

A lot of international companies have their HQ's in New York. Jobs in these companies by their very nature demand an incredible amount of energy. Sometimes with this type of job, people end up not getting the balance - between responsibilities to their job, responsibilities to their family, and responsibilities to their community - right.

It actually looks like the area is under development, not a wasteland. You also need to compare the size of the U.S with england. Do you expect the entire country to be similar to that of a vibrant city? The U.S. is massive, there are a lot of areas that are still relatively untouched.

Statute law which sets out the limitations of government is not "ridiculous". The founding fathers were smart enough to know that if Government was the supreme law-maker, then a corrupt government would simply alter the law to make tyranny legal. To prevent this, they set out very clearly what Governments can and can't do. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, not the Federal Government. If there is ever a conflict, the Constitution takes priority.

</quote>

Sure, you do need to have checks and balances but even when you do have them they can fail (see Wiemar Republic and Hitler) but in many ways the mess we are in right now is down to the fact laws and decisions cannot be made easily in the US when needed. Just look at gun laws in our country. I like being able to own a gun, but the law makes it very easy to get hold of one and we are now stuck in this position because stricter gun laws would just drive weapon trade underground. The ideals behind the constitution are great, but the constitution itself is too rigid. The simple truth is that our government doesn't function as well as some governments in other developed nations.

I'm not American, I'm Scottish.

Yep, those with malicious intent can get hold of a gun fairly easily in the US, but this is certainly not a reason to change the law. If you regress into the mindset of wanting to ban anything that might be dangerous, you end up trying to ban everything - After all, a knife can be a "lethal weapon" just as much as a gun, yet no one would ever support a knife ban.

Just think how difficult a time Hitler would have had if the Jews had a 2nd Amendment.

The Constitution has to be rigid, to prevent corrupt Government's from altering it at will. The founding fathers knew that America would change over time, and that's why they allowed Amendments to be added, provided they had a certain amount of support (The threshold of support needed is quite high). This ensures that only necessary Amendments make it through.

Are you implying that the UK has a corrupt government? The issue I have with the constitution is that it is too difficult to change.

Also, there are a few amendments that we have difficulty getting rid of. For instance the 14th amendment allows immigrants who have children in the US immediate citizenship. This was adopted so that slaves could get equal rights, but slavery went away more than 150 years ago and now this amendment is abused. Because of the rigidity of the constitution we have an unnecessary and detrimental law.

I'll think you'll find that a lot of international corporations also have their HQ's in Texas due to its low corporation tax and no income tax. Yes, some of those jobs will require a lot of time and dedication, but the ones that require absolute dedication (i.e. work becoming the one dominating constant in a person's life) will form the minority of what you'd call an "office job". And getting the balance "right" is completely subjective - there is no "right" balance as everyone has different opinions and aspirations. For some people, having a life that revolves around their work suits them just fine, and it's not really your place to say they're any less of a person because of it.

Calling NYC a hell-hole because it's an economic powerhouse is pretty lame tbh - the vast majority of people in this world view NYC as a bastion of opportunity and liberty. And I'll be the first to tell you that community collectivism and activism in the boroughs of NYC is strong - why else has it become one of the most progressive cities in the country?

I always love it when uni students play the subjective card. It's not really worthy of mature debate, because you'll never admit to losing an argument - You just trot out the "Oh, but that's just subjective" line.

I personally cannot criticize the people in America who chose to value their employer above their family and community. The reason for this is that I am not negatively affected by their office culture. The community around them obviously does have a right to criticize and condemn. After all, you have a duty to the community as well as a duty to your employer, and it's important to keep the right balance. Someone who choses to neglect their community in favour of their employer for no other reason than the acquisition of more money is, in my opinion, less of a person.

Sounds an awful lot like "I'm not getting my own way so I'm throwing a tantrum and running away".

Plenty of jobs do benefit the community, I have no problem with the people in those jobs. My problem is with people who focus too much on their work to the point where it negatively affects their duty to the community and family.

"Corporate community" is an oxymoron, let's keep on-topic here.

As you correctly state, you do have the freedom to adopt a "live to work" attitude, but you shouldn't let it get to the stage where the acquisition of money causes you to neglect your actual obligations to family and the community.

If, for financial profit, you decide to behave negatively towards the community, are they not well within their rights not to want anything more to do with you?

Perhaps i would just decide not to have a family at all? Would you judge me negatively for that too? Besides, money (or more accurately, wealth) can be used to make your family more happy.

No I would not judge you for having, or not having, a family. Regardless, you still have a responsibility to the community.

I think we have reached an impasse.

You are proposing that, instead of being a man and facing up to your responsibilities, you ignore them, and instead resort to buying expensive things to impress people, in a sad attempt to "buy" their happiness. Money cannot buy you happiness. People would prefer their corporate executive family member to spend time with them, not money on them.

The South has adapted well to these social changes. It may be the case that less progressive cities in the North are struggling to adapt to the modern era, in which case full support should be given to them with easing the transition.

I believe it. Why isn't money an alternative? You could always email/text family members and 'be with them' that way.

Money certainly facilitates happiness; I'd rather have a full bank and spend less time at home. There is nothing sad about that. Your career should come first and most spouses would (or should) understand this. Children can and need to learn patience. You have no responsibility to your neighborhood to be there. If you earn more money then you will in turn spend more money which benefits the community indirectly. Staying at home isn't productive, especially if you have a spouse who can look after any kids.

Southern states aren't more progressive than the north! The North is richer and the north in general has a different pace of life. Some people might prefer one lifestyle over the other, but that doesn't make one any worse or less progressive than another.

Being richer than other people does not make you progressive. I don't know how to make that any clearer to you. The North does indeed have a different pace of life, and with the greatest respect, it's hardly a desirable one.

I notice you once again resorted to using the "Oh it's just subjective, therefore there is no correct answer".

At the end of the day, a culture which encourages you to neglect your obligations to society IS less progressive than a culture which promotes a healthy alternative. Now, you can throw a tantrum about that if you like, but I will ignore it, and hopefully others will too. The simple fact is: Yes, you can neglect your responsibilities for financial profit if you want. However, don't be surprised if the community ostracizes you for behaving like that.

A richer nation leads to progression, both socially and technologically. The US is richer than Afghanistan. It is also more progressive. Wealth leads to innovation and improvement of living conditions which in turn leads to increased happiness. Work&gt;Breeding in terms of net quality of life.

The north is hardly an undesirable place to live. Longer and harder working hours come with increased wealth.

A grid pattern road scheme <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> Oh no. Well it must suck living in tiny cramped homes in the drizzle like sardines eh, but at least you have curved roads (my road is pretty curved by the way). The US has great cities - places like San Francisco, Portland, Boston, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Houston, LA, San Diego, Miami, Chicago, NYC, Indianapolis are hardly boring. The only British city worthy of comparison to those mentioned is London - believe me I have been to Birmingham (UK), Leeds, Glasgow and Manchester and they aren't much to write home about...

Some people don't see the appeal of making the world a better place through increased wealth. That is fine, but it isn't as productive for society as a whole. Who are you to decide what a 'healthy' culture is?! You are on the wrong side of the argument in this case.

</quote>

In this discussion, we are not talking about people who make the world a better place, we are talking about those who neglect their family and their community in the pursuit of wealth. In other words, those making the world a worse place. Can you see the difference?

A healthy culture is one that promotes a balance in responsibilities, as opposed to a culture that actually promotes the neglecting of one's responsibilities.

The pursuit of wealth makes the world a better place. It accelerates the turn over of wealth and improves everyone's lives in the process. What does having children do, except put a strain on an already overpopulated nation/planet.

I am saying that making your career is as equally valid and virtuous lifestyle (if not more so) choice as having a wife, two kids, a dog and a mediocre job or a civil partner for that matter. You should have a choice and not be judged by others as to whether your lifestyle choice is a 'correct' one.

By all means, life such a work-centred lifestyle, as long as it doesn't get in the way of your responsibilities.

If your work life affects your community responsibilities, things become different. If your choice ends up negativelyy affecting others, then of course they have every right to judge you.

Sounds an awful lot like "I'm not getting my own way so I'm throwing a tantrum and running away".

Plenty of jobs do benefit the community, I have no problem with the people in those jobs. My problem is with people who focus too much on their work to the point where it negatively affects their duty to the community and family.

But, if you remain incapable of adult debate, and wish to leave the thread, there is nothing I can do to stop you.

This is hilarious. Now you're taking the moral high-ground because I have better things to do than to argue with an in-denial communist idealist. The "problem" you're outlining (people who are work-orientated) - exists in all facets of society, and it's quite simply mind-boggling how you are attacking NYC with this very general phenomenon. And when you refer to "duty towards the community" or "duty towards the family" could you please name some specifics, because repeating that over and over just undermines your whole arguement with its monotony and vagueness.

Believe it or not, successful businessmen who work in the corporate world are human beings, not faceless drones. They have families, they have kids, they socialise with friends, they help out in the neighbourhood and so on. I know these very sorts of people in my family. I plan to have a career in finance or consultancy, and what you're saying is pretty irritating - as if having a high-flying career automatically means that you are a selfish money-whore. Even at the moment I am juggling internships, family life, volunteering in the community, socialising with friends and studying at university. Stop attacking these people - it seems like you have a chip on your shoulder or something. Even if a high paid investment banker was only cared about his work, he would benefit the community hugely (moreso than the vast majority of people) through his tax payments (income tax, variable taxes on goods and services purchases etc).

You made it personal when you said I'm incapable of adult debate. Well, I'm going to make it personal too. You sound like someone who's life hadn't turned out the way you wanted it to turn out, and now you're hating on the very people that you previously apsired to be. Stop hating. Calling NYC a hell-hole because there are some work-orientated individuals there (and they exist all over the world mind you, even in your precious Texas), isn't really what I'd call "adult debate".

Edit: And please could you outline how someone being work-orientated would negatively harm their community? Back your points with explanations. Again, hardly "adult" debating skills.

Berlin, spent 4 months in my German teacher's flat (she wasn't there obv) and doing bar work, had a ****ing blast. The nightlife was great and the people were friendly and patient.

NYC, similar to the above I was doing menial work to support myself but still had a ball, the music scene is thriving and there are so many things to do, the conversationism isn't as good as LDN but the parks are still pretty nice.

Going to a city for a week or two isn't enough time to gauge how good it is, you have to scrape by, struggle to support yourself and search out people and entertainment in order to gain a complete experience. I had no choice because I'm from a working class background but if any of you middle class (or higher) people choose to go to another city then I implore you to spend time supporting yourself, it's fulfilling as hell.

That said there are a lot of smaller, yet great cities but I'll keep this to the big ones that everyone knows. I really like some Scandinavia's cities but they don't really register on the world map

I agree with almost everything you said here ( I love The Burgh!)

But seriously how does the private school thing make it a good city? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>
I personally feel that it's one of the city's bad points. Since a disproportionate amount of children (1 in 4) go to private schools in Edinburgh I think this leads to the state schools doing less well. It also means there's a lot of holier than thou private school attitude in Edinburgh.

Disclaimer: I know a lot of privately educated people AREN'T remotely snobby, but as a generalisation...

I agree with almost everything you said here ( I love The Burgh!)

But seriously how does the private school thing make it a good city? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>
I personally feel that it's one of the city's bad points. Since a disproportionate amount of children (1 in 4) go to private schools in Edinburgh I think this leads to the state schools doing less well. It also means there's a lot of holier than thou private school attitude in Edinburgh.

Disclaimer: I know a lot of privately educated people AREN'T remotely snobby, but as a generalisation...

</quote>

I don't think it MAKES it a good city, its more of an indicator of one. Private schools are businesses which are dependant on customers, ie. rich folk. If a city has a large enough percentage of rich folk to support so many private schools then that surely is an indicator of prosperity? <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

In the UK; I like Edinburgh and Bristol, London is a world city but I'm not convinced it is very liveable. Outside of the UK - I love Berlin (which is hugely underrated), it has a great cultural scence, is reasonably priced, it oozes history and you will have trouble getting bored. Loads of the Scandanavian cities are liveable - but they fall short on how interesting they are to live in. In terms of being seats of power/finance - NYC, Paris, Tokyo, London, Hong Kong (and increasingly Shanghai and Beijing).

I was there in June and just found it to be sort of perfect version of the UK, clean streets (I dont remember ever seeing litter), everyone I met was very polite, warm, helpful and welcoming, public transport was amazingly well run. Lots of culture Ibsen museum and Norsk folk museum where highlights for me, beautiful parks, lovely harbour the view from frognerseteren. Every single woman was really attractive when is obviously a bonus.
The fact you can stand right outside parliament and the palace was jaw dropping when you comparing Oslo to New York and London most public buildings are like fortresses.
I'm slightly biased my girlfriend is half icelandic half norwegian so I was staying with her mothers family in Frogner so having all those people around probably swayed it for me.
Karl Johans gate is the best street in the world, I could sit drinking coffee outside the grand cafe for the rest of my life.

The whole city is just perfect in my eyes <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

It doesn't have the same wonderful reputation in Norway, but it's nice that you think that. I thought Oslo was OK, and I really like Karl Johan but I prefer Bergen (which is a beautiful city). I'm from the west coast though, and probably a little biased. Bergen is the unofficial capital of Western Norway after all. Yes, I've heard about the whole royal palace thing. I didn't know it was a little "weird" before people from other countries started commenting on it. Let's hope that Norwegian society will continue to be open and free.

Btw, am NOT a BNP supporter, however the might not GET into power, but you may see who is in power adopting some watered down versions of their policies, similar to Thatcher when the National Front was becoming more and more popular.

I think you'll find that when something like that happens, ther support will crumble.

To each their own though I guess

Although I detest what the BNP stand for, extremisim is needed to highlight the faults within this totalitarian government.

Perhaps people will now be presented with a legitimate choice as both the conservative party and labour party return to their traditional positions.

Sorry, my mistake for thinking that our system is probably one of best in the world, behind the likes of Zimbabwe and North Korea. We should take after them, yeah?

You sound an awful lot like a BNP lobbyist. Of course a democracy is going to be upheld through the force of law. Did you just want to hand out cookies instead if people obey the rules and do nothing if they don't?!

Heres a brief story:

If they win in the 2010 election :

Countries will brand the UK as the new "Nazi Country" and trade barriers will be put up against britain. The USA will immediately cease to be friends with the UK under Obama. Obama will cut ALL relationships with the UK no doubt about that.
As the BNP will kick out every single non white person whether born here or not, this will MASSIVELY crumble the economy. 10s of millions of jobs will be lost. Asians and Blacks will start huge riots across the UK and then THIS will lead to a CIVIL WAR.
Thousands will die.
Who will they now blame? The immigrants? But the BNP kicked them all out!

No my friend, the BNP will bring about its own downfall and the downfall of the UK by winning in the first place. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

Banning the BNP would do nothing to stop them. No political party should be banned as long as they are operating non-violently.
Oh and I think 0.1 % is a bit small. Walk into any pub in the land, and ask people "Lay people" if they agree with things like " Stopping more Immigration" or "Sending asylum seekers home" etc etc (the Usual simplistic rhetoric) and you would find so many people who agree.

The European elections will be a very interesting time indeed to see if they country is swinging more to the right generally.

I'm not surprised to be honest. When this happened before and the BNP took a lot of labour seats, it was all in very rich areas. It's in Sevenoaks. I don't expect any different to happen tbh. It's highly unlikely they will become popular enough to come into power.

It's a bad piece of journalism, when journalists are supposed to be impartial, but in reality, journalists are only human and do insert slight pieces of subjectivity where they can get away with it. No doubt, they also don't want to get on the wrong side of the NUJ's 'No Platform' policy.

It seems that journalists use the BNP whenever they have a slow news day, because they know even a stupid story like the BNP winning one council seat becomes massive because of what they represent. The BBC article sems about the right length ( <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7901252.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7901252.stm</a> ) but the Telegraph look like they're filling space and have used the same article for the web. It's not that big a story.

For all of the media outcry etc. realistically the BNP will probably gain no more than one or two MP seats in the next general election. All somebody who supports BNP could hope is that they are turn out to be less of a shambles than the far left's offering of Galloway and the Respect movement.

They could grow from this in years to come and pose more of a threat to the major parties (Labour were only a tiny party at the start of the last centure), but let's be realistic at this stage before we start hiding under the table or running for the pitchfork. The BNP can leap out and take pot-shots here and there, but they'll won't get elected into Government for quite a while, if at all.

Politics and the media often stir things up, and the same goes for members of this forum with political allegiances.

I would always personally vote BNP, but it's not the end of the world if they don't grow much and it would have very little effect on the superficial political system we have at present, or the wider world. Things would just gradually continue the same way they have been for ages.

What we need to focus on is de-stigmatising the BNP, so that more people can openly talk about them openly in public without feeling the instant need to add "but of course they're scum" to every sentance to avoid seeming like a bad person.

It's perfectly possible to be a patriotic BNP supporter and respectful to other cultures at the same time. The BNP want to create more equal opportunities, but stopping rich people from travelling the world to gain jobs and education with their superior resources that could otherwise have gone to the country's own citizens (albeit at a slightly higher cost).

I have no problem with the people that do these things; I just think it's a bit superficial and you should accept and be proud of your own culture rather than being a cultural tourist and trying to seep into other cultures and make them a part of yourself, which doesn't work anyway because you always come back to the same old place with the same old belief system. It's nature.

Things like this seriously worry me; we are in the middle of a financial crisis and in times like these the people worst affected tend to broadcast their hatred and the blame onto a minority party - think of Nazi Germany. In this case, the minority party would be immigrants, particularly (imo) Muslims.

If the story was that Labour had won a seat from the BNP, do you think that the BBC article would have been concluded with a derogatory quote about Labour being corrupt and their success being 'worrying'?

</quote>

No, but as a piece of journalism, this is all sound reporting. A large element of what journalists have to write is dictated by reader expectations and what one's employer wants (dictated by NUJ guidelines, which marginalise the BNP).

It is the system as a whole which works against the BNP, not one particular organisation. It would take a massive overhaul of many different media and public organisations to undo the indoctrination and bias that prevents the BNP's message from getting across in a non-corrupted/demonised/idiotic way in presentation terms, and as such the BNP have to work around this to convince a public largely influenced by media controled by anti-BNP bodies. They're doing incredibly well to grow as much as they have in such an environment.

One thing the BBC can be criticised is their patent bias and spin in the documentary The Secret Agent.

If they were advocating forced deportation, which I personally do, then I could at least understand why their coming to power would be seen as a very big deal, but the way some people talk (like the BNP coming to power and enacting their existing policies would be a surreal and unimaginable event) is crazy.

</quote>

I do think that 'ending immigration' really is very radical. I mean, when was this last really successfully done. The whole 'ending immigration' is quite a new thing with respect to the state of humanity over millenia. In the past it was more than possible for people to migrate and settle elsewhere. Think of the Irish in America, think of the Aryans in India, think of the Arabs in Persia etc. It's arguably absurd to permanently restrict people's movement.

I think 'forced deportation' would be very difficult to accomplish as well. I mean, for starters who would you choose to deport. Every migrant? What about descendants of migrants who were born in Britain who had earned their citizenship. What about those migrants who had paid far more in tax than their British counterparts? What about those who were legally married to somebody of British ethnicity. What about their children who would be of mixed ethnicity - (e.g. half-English, half-Polish). And how would religion come into this - would Catholics be deported? Which would matter more - religion or ethnicity? Would an ethnical.y British Sunni Muslim be deported in favour of an ethnically Persian Protestant? Would Europeans be allowed to stay (remember the EU treaty and freedom of movement). Which kind of Europeans? Western? Eastern? Both? Neither?

Don't you think there would be severe resistance to the 'forced deportation' policy. What if the people you intend to target resist? Don't you think that a sizeable proportion of the ethnically British population would fight alongside them? What if some resorted to crippling attacks like suicide bombing? How would you propose to capture London - 40% of the people there are migrants. If there is no alternative to your 'forced deportation' don't you think many people who may be going back to a warzone/poverty may consider fighting to the death - better to die in European prosperity than live in abject poverty in the developing world.

Even in the highly unlikely event that the BNP manage to create their 'Fortress Britain' what would happen to trade? What if various embargos were imposed? What about sanctions? What about the brain-drain? Many of the most intellectually capable people in Britain are of foreign descent. Would you allow British people to leave (voluntarily?). What if Britain becomes a pariah-state. What if all other nations block entry of any 'Britons'. What if a coalition decides to take military action and there is an invasion. Also consider your ageing population. What about when younger people are necessary to keep the economy aloof? Etc, etc.

I suppose you're right by that metaphor, and it is a good one, but as mass immigration divides communities more and more, what is a scab now may become more of a scar, or a tumour.

And the only way to stop the tumour spreading or eject it, would be to call in the doctors.

I used to be quite mainstream/left-leaning, but after I moved to an area where there was real and genuine racial tension (constantly lurking under the surface, but rarely confronted), I swung to the far right, and the demonisation of the far right has only really served to reinforce those beliefs cuz you see that for all of the anti-BNP manta, how little all of its opponants really are offering.

They're very noisy, but what solution are they offering to the nation's problems? The BNP tackle pavement politics head on, and get to grips with local peoples' problems as well as dealing with the multi-cultural issues that nobody else will confront. The far left are divided and can't make up their minds as to what they want besides "NO BNP!!!11L11ONE!" and the mainstream parties that have wrecked our economies and led us into two unjust, pointless wars with barely a dissenting voice are saying very little about how to significantly change things.

If they were advocating forced deportation, which I personally do, then I could at least understand why their coming to power would be seen as a very big deal, but the way some people talk (like the BNP coming to power and enacting their existing policies would be a surreal and unimaginable event) is crazy.

Well, in one sense I think you do use it as a 'protest' vote, if only in the sense that you're protesting against the recent tide of multiculturalism which has swept British shores.

I do think it's quite radical for a British person to oppose multiculturalism, incidentally. Yet that's just because I think it's quite radical to care about someone elses' race. Granted, I've heard your arguments for why you think it is rational to care about someone's race; so I guess it's a matter of personal preference. However personal preference can be accomodated within a multiculturalist society. Nobody forces anyone else to associate with another race inside your own property, yet multiculturalism allows British people to have the opportunity to do precisely that if they so wish.

And given the history of the BNP, I think it's understandable that they're seen as quite an extremist party - their protests, their "power by the boot" slogan they used to adopt, their previous policies (incidentally, it's no surprise that most people who deny the Holocaust, as Griffin did, often come with some political baggage...) They've changed their PR, but I think the same BS still lurks deep down inside the majority of their fan base.

This is clearly the point - immigration is needed to sustain Labours benefit culture. I suspect voters in general would quite like to see immigration retarded and benefits reduced. These tensions are the result of Labour attempting to buy votes through benefits.

I'll agree that class and nationality play a part, you're conflating race, nationality, and culture, too. Or, rather, some cultural nationalities (and most of the ones which we come into contact with regularly) are fairly mono-ethnic and therefore mono-racial. Switzerland is an example of a country with largely one culture, but several ethnies. In America or Brazil you don't just have several ethnies but also several racial groups forming a single cultural nation. With Serbs, Bosniaks, and Croats on the other hand, what you've got is one ethnic group but three different cultures.

Well I'd argue that race and culture CAN be entirely separate.

The economic argument is often raised in these arguments - either because we need immigrants for the menial jobs or to run the big businesses in our country.

But the fact is that white British people are not all permanently disabled or somehow uncapable of doing these jobs themselves. My mum left school at 13 to work in a shop and keep her family going as respectable, hard-working, salaried community members.

The culture since her day has changed, so that shop workers are looked down on in the white British community and as such white Brits would rather claim the doll than work in a job where they will have no respect.

Change this culture and get these people to have some pride in themselves and wanting to achieve in life, and they will get up off their arses, and replace all of the immigrants who have stolen these jobs with their often undeserved reputation for working hard.

Personally, I would look more into a policy of withdrawing benefits and ensuring that each provides worth to the country, which could be determined via a variety of measuring sticks, with deportation for all of those who do not meet the standard.

I would also impose more stringent laws on them e.g. not allowed to mate with a white person or take certain jobs.

No, because this is our country and they are a part of it. They are our responsibility.

You wouldn't just disown your little brother, cuz he was a bit of a pain in the backside (though certain Islamic cultures would in certain situations) and not very useful. Instead, you'd encourage them to do better.

But you would more willingly kick someone out of your house or business if they weren't related to you and you really didn't have anything in common beneath the surface.

I can't see WHY they wouldn't want to "achieve" in life - I mean - what else do these people want to do? Spend their lives enslaved to alcohol? Surely they must have aspirations.

How on earth is it possible to "steal" a job as well? Possibly the immigrant was selected for the position over the native since that person was more suited to the job specification.

Jobs aren't "stolen" - and it is very arrogant to think that! Imagine if I was rejected for a position that I applied to and just said - oh well - somebody "STOLE what was my job by God-given right" - excessive hubris there don't you think? And regards the belief that immigrants do the menial jobs etc, etc. this also isn't completely true. There are many very skilled and highly educated migrants from all over the world working in the City of London for example - there's no obligation that migrants should need to do the menial tasks - in fact, when working in professional-level positions - they're actually paying more in tax into the coffers of the British government. For example, I came to Britain 18 years ago not knowing how to speak English at all - but now I am fluent in the language, attained an A* in it at GCSE level 3 years ago - and also work in the City of London - I think it's far too easy to pigeonhole people in arguments like these!

Of course they can be entirely separate, where everybody is able to live side by side and get along.

But the situation will usually arise during the course of your life time when you are met by a foreign culture entirely opposed to your way of life, and then your own culture will come very much to the forefront.

In the real world, where there is competition for jobs, women/men, money, power, survival, people do group off into those similar to themelves, and in situations where there is mass immigration and particularly Islamic extremism from these foreign cultures, racial and religious culture very much comes to the fore and is very important in your self-definition.

In 1998 Nick Griffin said, "I am well aware that the orthodox opinion is that 6 million Jews were gassed and cremated and turned into lampshades. Orthodox opinion also also once held that the Earth was flat... I have reached the conclusion that the "extermination" tale is a mixture of Allied wartime propaganda, extremely profitable lie, and latter witch-hysteria."

Griffin wrote an article for Spearhead in June 1999 after the Admiral Duncan pub bombing. He said, "The TV footage of dozens of gay demonstrators flaunting their perversions in front of the world's journalists showed just why so many ordinary people find these creatures so repulsive."

I never said all immigrants do menial job. In fact, I picked somebody else up on this, saying it's either "we need immigrants for our economy, because of all of the international business coming in" or "we need them to do all the menial jobs white Brits don't want to do." Always one or the other.

But the fact is white Brits could do all of these jobs if trained, encouraged and made to feel a part of society.

Indians, for instance, place a lot of emphasis on the family unit and education, but the politicians that lead white Brits have encouraged the disintigration of the family unit and the disestablishment of all sense of national unity and pride. Our culture is weakening while ethnic minority cultures are strengthening.

You're right, it isn't the fault of the immigrants. They're just doing what all living things do - trying to get hold of the resources they need to survive, earn power, make money, live comfortable lives, find a reputable place in society.

What pisses me off is that we have these resources, and we're giving them away. Do our politicians think that all of the natural competition of the world will stop and we will live in one big multicultural land of peace just because we let a few immigrants in?

The fact is that if we don't take a hardline against foreign cultures, we will be replaced and all of the superior resources we have, which you mentioned, will be taken away from us.

The only thing that matters is if you're a Caucasian (white). The content of your character, your qualities, your love for the country and what you could provide for it; zilch. But honestly, if the country ever came to that, who in their right mind would want to live here or associate themselves with the country that only welcomes you if you're white?

Contrary to popular belief, non-EU immigrants are not eligible for any form of state benefits until they are naturalized. They're only eligible for emergency healthcare and can be educated in British schools if under the age of 18. So surely most of these migrants would certainly 'meet your standard'. Think about the taxes they are paying versus the amount of money they are claiming from the state (nil). If they're using public services, think about the fact that they are also contributing to the upkeep of such public services.

Also, how do you propose to impose those 'marriage laws'. In actual fact, part of my ancestry is Indian (Dravidian), the bulk is Persian (Aryan) with a bit of Turkmeni and Portuguese in the mix as well. I have, when I was younger made love to more than one ethnically British woman (but I didn't have children with her). Is it OK for me to do that - as long as there are no children? Or is just the thought of sex between an ethnically British and non-British person horrid? Also when you say 'Indian' do you mean Indian by nationality or ethnicity. The thing is, there is one Indian nationality, but multiple cultures and ethnicities in the Indian subcontinent - e.g. Kashmiris, Punjabis, Aryans, Brahmins, Rajputs, Gujuratis, Marathas, Kannadigas, Andhrites, Biharis, Pathans, Parsees, Bengalis, Assamese, Malayalees, Tamils etc. Is it not ok for an ethnically/nationally British person to have sex/reproduce with a person from one of the aforementioned ethnic groups? And what exactly is the punishment if they do happen to be in a relationship with each other? And how would you seek to prevent such occurrences from happening? Don't you think it would be very difficult? Also, isn't it the human right of the British and non-British individual in question to pursue their relationship/sex life with each other as they please? - rather than having to submit to the BNP's demand to meddle in their private lives. Please let me know.

</quote>

I'm sure SOME Indians (Possibly even the majority) place alot of emphasis on the family unit and education but maybe not all. Likewise there must be at least a few ethnically British people who are very similar in that regard. Can't you see that 'British' and 'Indian' cultures are probably very pluralistic and NOT AT ALL mutually exclusive. They're not discontinuous. There are probably so many similarities. In fact, the most distinct differences probably arise from things which are of trivial importance to social harmony - such as dress and cuisine! And people of both ethnicities seem to enjoy each other's dress and cuisine so can't see too many problems there!

Also, how precisely have British politicians encourage the 'disintegration' of the British family unit - I imagine that this family unit existed in the past. Also, wouldn't their initiatives also have targeted Indians living in Britain? Wouldn't they also be exposed to influences which encourage the disintegration of family structure? Do politicians stand up and say "Listen up white British people, I would like you to abandon your families, enslave yourselves to alcohol, screw your aspirations and spend your lives dependent on the state. PS. The following advice is NOT applicable to any ethnic minorities, in fact please do the opposite". Thought not. I don't think you can conveniently shift the blame onto politicians.There are surely many ethnically British people who are doing well for themselves and I don't think it's a matter of ethnicity at all, more one of attitude and personal (rather than ethnicity-based) values.

What disadvantage would it hold if someone swapped your newborn baby for a stranger's baby without your knowledge - none? Well I don't think you would be happy about it if found out. The fact is that kinship is important to humans.

It's not just that they are not 'white' either - they are not racially British, they are not racially Northern European, and then they are not even white i.e. European-derived. Racial differences amongst European 'whites' count too, whether or not we advocate deporting other Europeans.

</quote>

If some British Pakistani boy was born and grew up in the same area as you, went to your school, had the same hobbies as you, like the same music, had the same sort of sense of humour etc. and you were just generally similar people and he was a nice guy, would you feel closer to some White stranger born and raised in Poland who came over at 19 to get a job but just caused trouble and was nothing like you? Would you see the boy who's parents were from Pakistan sent back to that country and the Polish boy stay here or both sent back or what??
I don't understand why race, one factor irrelevant to most of life, is given so much importance!

If, say, you got ridiculously drunk and ended up 'accidentally' sleeping with with an equally drunk Black girl and she got pregnant and kept the baby, would you be happy so see it swapped at birth for a fully White child? Is kinship more important than race? Would you have nothing to do with the child at all? If that Black girl was half Jamaican and half Ethiopian but born here and never been to either, which country would you prefer your child got forcibly shipped back 'home' to?

Jeez, I don't get this at all. You're not related to every White person in existence! Nor are you similar to every White person. Why even mention kinship?? Or, if you are related to every White person, then you're probably distantly related to every person. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/dontknow.gif" alt=":dontknow:"/>

The problem for me is the non-reciprocal nature of the population flow between racial groups in recent times and today, which is essentially a massive flow of non-Europeans into European and European-occupied territories.

Interbreeding makes this situation worse for obvious reasons i.e. Britons no longer exist to defend their interests, British racialism might mean conflict within extended families where one individual has interbred, etc.

</quote>

Does the numbers of people settling in either country really matter? I don't think you can safely say that India is maintaining its own racial borders - I'm sure there are foreigners settling in India and mating with the locals. I can't see why that is a problem if the two people involved are consenting to that. There are racist/religionist groups in India such as RSS/VHP who oppose racial interbreeding etc but I don't see why they believe that an individual person should have a duty to a 'mythical race'? People tend to move to where the wealth is. That's why many people migrated to the Gangetic plains of northern India from Afghanistan, Central Asia and Persia. In the same way that Lombard, Visigoth and Hunnic invaders migrated to the fertile plains of northern Italy. Nowadays, it is Western Europe that is prosperous and that is a land of opportunity - hence why there is 'demand' to make it there. I don't think there is much European 'homogeneity' either - ethnicity and race are social constructs - granted there are a few genetic markers peculiar to any social population - such as higher incidence of cystic fibrosis in northern Europeans, but a much greater proportion of our genome codes for proteins that influence metabolism (i.e. the reactions that go one within us). You could therefore argue (scientifically and quantitatively) that there is much more similarity between a fat northern European and a fat non-northern European than there is between a fat northern European and a thin northern European person? Also, where does northern Europe end and southern Europe begin? And have you got substantive genetic analyses to support your hypotheses? The familial conflict that you talk about would only be applicable if someone in the family chose to take offence at the incorporation of somebody of another ethnicity into their family unit. I don't see how this 'weakens' the family unit - in many cases people don't really care about the ethnicity of the person that their son/daughter/brother/sister marries? Surely it's not as important as the content of their character/other features? Also, wouldn't a child of mixed ethnicity tend to have potentially greater resistance to a larger variety of infectious diseases?

Most Scottish people have a similar amount of Celtic DNA as people in the South of England. Our DNA is very similar, both Scotland and Ireland also received large immigration from Anglo-saxons and Vikings. The only place with a significant amount of celtic DNA tends to be Wales, but even then most of Britain still has the majority of DNA stretching right back till the last ice age. Most of our DNA is Basque apparently.

And ive read quite a bit into the subject with one of the theories being that with the increase in post-materialism and globalisation, people feel threatened (i.e. they will loose their jobs) and with post-materialism there are always loosers who still have to worry about the material.

X.R. parties pray on this as they are extremely professional in nature, but its also about supply and demand if u get my drift.

I have noticed that BNP have replaced Jewish bashing with Islam bashing.

There is a really funny forum called Stromfront. According to them the Jews want to destroy the white race and every non-white person is inferior and violent.

Most people don't blame other people for bad things happening like losing a job. I think the BNP is sort of a losing mentality that it's immigrants that have caused all the problems.

Appealing to the lowest common denominator is always going to get you votes, it wont get you any power though. Basically their aim is to target areas where there is friction between us and Johnny foreigner, and exploit people who are naturally bigoted anyway or just ignorant. As others have said they will never get more than the odd seat or three or so in councils anywhere. Or in times of woe maybe a seat in parliament but that's about it.

It really all depends. If our current FPTP system keeps in place, then yes.

However if PR were to be implemented, then they have a much better chance of gaining alot more than 3 seats.

Cases in point: FPO in Austria, and in Italy Lega Nord and the AN although they were both coalitions which wouldn't happen here any time soon.

Nope, the reason why some get arrested, especially cases in Belgium, Netherlands and Germany is because they get baned for being too extremist.

That is one reason why people migrate, yes. However, that does not mean that we ought to put up with it.

Europe is not racially homogeneous, but there is a European race. And there certainly is a wider Caucasian race. Race is a biological reality, no doubt about it. There are multiple scientific studies that you ought to consult in order to learn about this, but the easiest way might be to visit Dienekes blog or GNXP.

Science would disagree with almost everything you have said. But then when has science been consulted by people who have agendas, except to manipulate it to your own ends. I suggest you read something that isn't propaganda by the Right wing.

The human races diversity is so minor that the term race for humanity is meaningless. Scientists tend to look at gradations according to geography as populations become more widespread historically or further apart geographically now. No species in the animal kingdom that shared 99.5% of each others DNA would ever be delineated at all, even into sub groups, let alone split into separate categories. Such a distinction is purely historical and is based on ignorance not scientific methodology.

The gene differences between Europeans are even less significant and barely worthy of note except in a historical/anthropological note, to see where we came from and where we spread to.

The genetic differences between a single population are more pronounced than those between other "races".

Encyclopaedia Britannica

<quote>
"[T]he idea that the human species is divided into distinct groups on the basis of inherited physical and behavioral differences. Genetic studies in the late 20th century denied the existence of biogenetically distinct races, and scholars now argue that “races” are cultural interventions reflecting specific attitudes and beliefs that were imposed on different populations in the wake of western European conquests beginning in the 15th century."

"The modern meaning of the term race with reference to humans began to emerge in the 17th century. Since then it has had a variety of meanings in the languages of the Western world. What most definitions have in common is an attempt to categorize peoples primarily by their physical differences. In the United States, for example, the term race generally refers to a group of people who have in common some visible physical traits, such as skin colour, hair texture, facial features, and eye formation. Such distinctive features are associated with large, geographically separated populations, and these continental aggregates are also designated as races, as the “African race,” the “European race,” and the “Asian race.” (Some experts suggest there are five or more geographic races.) Many people think of race as reflective of any visible physical (phenotypic) variations among human groups, regardless of the cultural context and even in the absence of fixed racial categories."

"Although most people continue to think of races as physically distinct populations, scientific advances in the 20th century demonstrated that human physical variations do not fit a “racial” model. There are no genes that can identify distinct groups that accord with the conventional race categories. DNA analyses have proved that all humans have much more in common, genetically, than they have differences."

Wiki: race and genetics

<quote>
Human genetic variation

Human to human total genetic variation is approximately 0.5%. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single base-pair DNA differences accounting for 0.1% variation. Based only on this SNP variation of 0.1%, this implies that the genomes of any two random humans are expected to differ by about 3 million base pairs. Of this 0.1% difference, 85% is found within any given population, 7% is found between populations within a continent and only 8% is found on average between the various continental populations. Thus there is more genetic diversity within a continental population than between these populations. Based on this observation, Richard Lewontin has claimed that accurate classification of humans is therefore impossible and can have no taxonomic utility. However, this view has been rejected by A. W. F. Edwards in his paper entitled Human Genetic Diversity: Lewontin's Fallacy, Edwards shows that accurate classification of humans is possible because most of the data that distinguishes populations occurs in correlations between allele frequencies, although these classifications vary depending on a number of criteria, such as sampling strategy, type of locus, distribution of loci around the genome and number of loci. On the other hand Witherspoon et al. (2007) have shown that even when accurate classification of human populations is achieved, often individuals classified into different groups are more genetically similar to each other than to members of their own group. This seems to be due to the fact that multi-locus clustering does not take into account the genetic similarities between individuals, and only uses population level traits for comparison. Witherspoon et al. conclude that accurate classification of individuals drawn from a continuously varying human population may be impossible. Compared with other species the amount of genetic diversity among humans is relatively small. For example two random chimpanzee are expected to differ by about 1 in 500 DNA base pairs, equivalent to double the diversity amongst humans. This may indicate that chimpanzees have existed as a species much longer than humans.[3]

Ancestry-informative marker are stretches of DNA which have several polymorphisms that exhibit substantially different frequencies between the different populations. Using these AIMs scientists can determine a person's continent of origin based solely on their DNA. AIMs can also be used to determine someone's admixture proportions.[4]

Let people vote how they choose.

The BNP have more to them than racial policies. No-one could tell how prominent those aspects would be if by a tiny chance they did get into power. Nationalism isn't necessarily Nazism. But Nick Griffin is an incompetant hypocrite, and he certainly doesn't do anything to lower the view of the BNP as neo-Nazi racists. I can't stand the man, but am indifferent to the party; I trust they'll never get in, so see little point in kicking up a fuss.

I do think, however, that it would be worth considering people's reasons for electing the BNP- they are not necessairly racists- there are other BNP policies which may be drawing the votes in, which would be interesting to find out about. I'd be fascinated to know if the new-found "appeal" stems solely from their immigration views.

Well, I understand. I did a project on the BNP and Front Nationale for my French A Level, and learned a fair bit about them beyond the "vicious racists" surface label.

This is an interesting point.

The vote for extreme right parties can come from a wide variety of political backgrounds. My lecturer in XR in western europe said that she knew of a case in france where a man had voted communist for 40 years, lost his job and then voted for Le Pen and Front Nationale.

Just like its not the core of the labour vote. More recently its been white (obviously, ive yet to come across one that isn't), middle class males who are both skilled and unskilled workers.

My point is that its not just one segment like "the skin heads" any more. The XR has evolved and you need to keep in mind that their support comes from a wide range.

They won't actually do it, its just a policy designed to appeal to racists. If it was tried, only a small portion will have been deported until the plan starts to fall apart and they have to stop (especially if they are paying £50,000 per person - or is that only for white people?).

If you're interested you should look at the BNP website. I think the key point is that the "deportation" would in fact be "voluntary" as people would be paid to leave. I know that this does not make a great deal of sense.

The pattern is much the same amongst all race-denying 'scientists'.

The only way that the idea of biological race could reasonably be denied is if race were supposed to represent very discrete populations, perhaps only of a limited number. However this simply is not the way most people would use the word race, and pretty much any valid category such as sex or age could be criticised in the same way.

</quote>

The reason it is denied is because of the insignificant differences between populations. That's genetic variation, 0.1%-0.5% is simply nowhere near enough to classify anyone as a distinct race. That is the reason others studies have been discredited. Not because of the Left wing conspiracy or any other bs.

Not true, see Sarich and Miele (2004) where they show that racial differences between various other primate races (which are part of the scientific discourse) are in fact smaller than those between human races.

Not true, see here <a href="http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/09/geography-and-genetic-structure-in.html">http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/09...ucture-in.html</a>

Those links say there are differences, I don't see anywhere were it says they should be categorised into distinct races and only the fringe thinks otherwise. Before you start into it's all a conspiracy by lefties you might actually want to study material that isn't someone's blog and is peer reviewed. Anything else isn't worth anyone's time. Suffice to say science isn't based on political agendas it's based on genetics, and the genetics are incontrovertible. There is not enough drift to classify any people as a distinct race end of story. And one or two naysayers amongst the host who believe otherwise is not to be taken as a consensus, that way lies crackpot land. Pick any science and I'll show you counter theories, the thing is a counter theory is not the mainstream and you should not cherry pick to find minority sources if you want to give a clear and unbalanced view of the issue.

No one denies there aren't differences, but no matter how you manipulate the figures they are just not large enough to denote a different race, particularly in continents and even in geographically diverse locations, that is pretty much debunked by science.

Just like its not the core of the labour vote. More recently its been white (obviously, ive yet to come across one that isn't), middle class males who are both skilled and unskilled workers.

My point is that its not just one segment like "the skin heads" any more. The XR has evolved and you need to keep in mind that their support comes from a wide range.

You're very unlikely to get Lib Dems defecting en masse to the BNP and Tories usually always vote Tory, a party most consider a personal thing, Labour however is existant due to the belief that there is a working-class and most people who vote Labour in the north (where the BNP are most prominent) profess to being working-class. Despite the fact that Thatcher abolished the working class about 20 years ago.

Labour voters of the non liberal elite / public worker type tend to vote for them without much though, politically, so the switch to the BNP is greatest in hitherto Labour strongholds. You are right of course, it is sporadic. Some Conservatives may believe that the BNP or UKIP now espouse their true beliefs but usually the Tory voter is aspirant, middle-class, who wants to pursue a stable financial grounding for his/her kin rather than wanting to deport non-whites like the BNP want.

Thats true to an extent.

Previous political identifications don't really have much relevance to explaining why people vote for the extreme right. What has is the socioeconomic situation, political dealignment and voids left by main stream parties.

Exreme right voters are generall more inclined to vote X.R. when either through globalisation or for whichever percieved reasons the situation threatens their job.

Also, how they feel the main stream politics is treating them has a huge amount to explaining the rise in X.R. voting. If there is a void, X.R. parties usually do all they can to fill it thus inviting more votes.

As with one of my previous posts, there was a man in france who voter communist for over 40 years, lost his job and then voter Le Pen.

Now that can't be explained by conventional spital variations, instead we must look at the demand and supply situation of X.R. parties which include socio-economic and political situations.

It gives a figure of 3.1% cross-racial similarity for intermediate or admixed populations, which is small for the purposes of ethnic nepotism. In fact for the purposes of ethnic nepotism what I believe is important is the population centroid similarity, i.e. how often an individual is more similar to a different population centroid than his own; because mass immigration involves massive numbers, and therefore individual interactions are less important than the mean effect (are less similar individuals replacing more similar individuals on average?) As Witherspoon et al show, the centroid value also tends to decrease faster than the pairwise similarity.

If there is a 1% chance that I benefit reproductively from mass immigration from India, the odds indicate to me that I should still take a racialist stance against this. And I definitely benefit from kicking out the negroids and mongoloids anyway.

Clustering reflects genetic similarity, it signifies smaller genetic differences within clusters than across clusters wrt geographic distance. However population traits rather than pairwise distances simply bring the clustering to light more easily because as you can see in the Witherspoon study, pairwise similarity across races decreases more slowly as more loci are analysed (although the same trend exists for both measures).

Of course accurate classfication of an individual Greek or Turk if you were comparing them may not be possible, but that is missing the point about race. Considerations such as that are not very relevant to the idea of ethnic nepotism; it is simply a matter of who is similar to me in general, where the general natural population structure lies (i.e. on the level of Europe, sub-Saharan Africa), and practical considerations.

The argument about race is completly irrrevant to the original quesion.

Ignazi (1992, i think) has shown that there are two types of X.R. parties. Old, with historical links to fascism which have had no success bar MSI in Italy, and New style parties which are still xenophobic, anti-system, racist etc.

And as Carter 2005 has shown (+ many others) there are atleast 5 different types of X.R. parties. with almost all of them being CULTURALY racist rather that racially racist due to the links with fascism and nazism. They usually that belive that multi-culturalism dilutes culture and that two cultures are incompatiable with each other.

Who said it did, it is merely reviewed by those in a position to determine if it is dots the is and crosses the ts.

But peer reviewed science nonetheless demonstrates the existence of race, and it is generally the soundbites and non-scientific releases that deny race.
</quote>

You deny it on one hand and laud it on another. As I say a concensus amongst a tiny minority is not a scientific consensus. It's just a less well recieved view. No ones saying it's wrong or right but science works on overturning consensus and that is not achieved by being a few lone voices in a crowd of dissenters.

Pavlik scientific consensus is harder to come by than a virgin in an Essex nightclub. Why you insist on it being some sort of conspiracy is beyond me. No it doesn't mean it's untrue but science tends to rely on authority, not one or two dissenters.

OK this sounds like sociology rather than philosophy to me, academically trying to answer questions that don't have an answer. Your example about one guy in France, I'm sorry means nothing. We're discussing the British turn of events and I aruge that we have never been a nation that votes for parties like the BNP, we switch between centrist/centre-left in the good times and centre-right in the bad times, we untypically reject nationalism unlike your European/French example(s). My point here is, the UK is somewhat different.

It is clear, and has been for some time, that the BNP is overwhelmingly benefiting from disenchanted Labour voters, voting for the Right (Con) is tribally frowned upon so is not even given an educated thought and they do not trust nor understand the Libs. It is an uncomfortable truth for Labour ministers and MPs to accept but their voters set of beliefs and attitudes are actually rather distant from themselves and they have engenered within their own tenure an uncomfortable swing to nationalism as a direct response to their policies.

Without being facetious or anything, Labour is a two-term party, three terms and one finds economic downturns and increased intolerance/community/social problems, thus the topic of this thread.

The Tories? They will be concerned by the rising tide of nationalism like Labour for altruistic reasons, it is unpalatable and, well not nice, but they don't have the problem. Labour does and they know it.

For all your philosophical answers, it doesn't really answer or even discusses why the BNP popularity is rising. Which after all is the point of this thread.

This question does have an academic answer. Ive been answering it for my dissertation.

I think we may have had different questions in our minds. I'm trying to stick to the original question.

Im not really sure what the question you are discussing is, but if its the orignal question then it would be obsurd to say that it couldn't be academically answered.

Further about my french case: yes your right to an extent. For all the models by leading XR acadmics (Mainly, Ignazi, Eatwell, Carter and a few others) there are still country specific factors. For example, scandinavian XR parites aren't sexist because gender equality is extremly important in scandinavian politics, however in Italy, that may not be the case.

However the underlying socioeconomic and political context can be used to explain alot about the rise of the extreme right.

I'm giving you the answer. Failed New Labour project.

Legislating against the family; against the father; the man-in-work.

Legislating for; total EU compliance; porous border protection, ostensibly to fill the UK workforce with skilled foreign labour but perceived to be for the dilution of 'c'onservative attitudes and 'C'onservative voters; increased foreign aid (something I support).

These may or may not be debatable, BUT, the BNP voter, i.e. the white working-class male (and his female peers) feel very hard done by the Labour party they have devoted their lifelong suffrage to unlike any other time in history.

Also, overwhelming numbers of British people uneqivocally support the UK armed forces and feel Labour has let them down (plus the wars), support for monarchy/old institutions is also rather indelible, and the upper working classes find it insulting when Labour perhaps try to rewrite a nation's history in a matter of years.

This is very broad I know and I could be more specific, but I drink in pubs and listen to the bile BNP voters churn and I deem myself well learned in their, basic, but obviously topical beliefs.

But that answer can be easily discredited. How do you explain extreme right voting (in Britain) before New Labour?

You need to look at the socioeconomic, political, supply and demand factors.

I don't vote Labour. But by the sounds of your argument, you clearly have a vendta or grudge against them.

There are not one or two dissenters though, any serious scientific paper on human genetic variation nowadays demonstrates the validity of biological race, or at least the paper that has the last word does.

What? Are you serious?

There is not a conspiracy, however there are supposed scientists like Dawkins, Lewontin, and Venter who mislead the public about various issues relating to race for no good scientific reason.
</quote>

Nonsense, no scientist no matter what his credentials is above being shown to be wrong, in fact in science that is a national sport, if you can pick off a big wig you get extra kudos and a chufty badge.

<quote>
The straw man objections have some validity; of course there are not very discrete races, and of course it is not easy to fit every individual ideally into a set number of races, particularly if the number is small. But the idea that race is not a biological reality is totally unfounded, increasingly so in recent years.
</quote>

They are not straw men? People aren't trying to foist off a left wing agenda here, and the more you keep saying science is corrupt the less seriously people will take you. Science does rely on funding, but it also relies on facts. And if you are right then the consensus can and does change no matter how big your scientific balls are. For example Einstein, Schrödinger and others were pwned off the court when they tried to discredit a theory they had in the main given great credence too because of its sheer weirdness. If anything the bigger your name the more people there are that will gun for you if you are wrong. If any scientific field is wrong it may take time, but eventually it will be forced to get into line before more robust theories. Well into the 70s and 80s global warming was considered fringe, but gradually it got overturned by others of a skeptical bent. Then it became mainstream, now there are serious attempts to go the other way, it's what science does. In the early part of the 20th century no one would have taken the idea that races were indistinct seriously, but with the advent of genetics, the worm turned.

Anyway I'm done take it to another thread I'm outa here.

Yes I am very much against Labour because I do not believe they serve a purpose. In my view they merey destroy all in their path with little genuine results.

My argument is actually very much the reason the BNP is on the rise. Explain previously extreme voting? Where? We have never sent an extreme MP to parliament, as I explained earlier, by and large the UK is a three party state - NF and so forth never got a foot in and were certainly never posed to take control of local councils. It is a recent phenomena, and my argument is, brought on by the disastrous policies of New Labour. Alienation and disregard being the association of that.

You knowledge on the overal extreme right seems limited (no personal offense). There is no academic evidence to suggest that the rise of the BNP is due to New Labour.

We have never elected a BNP candidate to any form of parliament. So by your own logic, your argument is flawed!

Where the traditional mainstream anti-fascist movements are going wrong is that they have a limited community presence. The BNP have moved from the streets to communities - ones that feel abandoned by mainstream politics as it chased the bright lights of the City.

Turning up en masse everytime the far right does well somewhere, shouting loudly before going back home, or holding "Marxist Society" meetings on campus has achieved little. As far as the anti-BNP student movement is concerned, unless it makes face-to-face connections with those communities where the BNP is doing well, and engages with them to understand why they feel the way that they do (rather than saying "They iz nazees, they iz bad and so iz U 4 votin' 4 dem!"), and thus helping to break some of the stereotypes that we have about each other is one way forward. But it involves time, effort and risk taking. Far easier and safer to have a socialist society meeting about how evil the nazis are, march from A to B and shout loudly in a hastily arranged protest whenever the far right gain electoral success.

The various projects at <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/projects/">http://www.mysociety.org/projects/</a> may give you some ideas on how to go beyond the tried and tested actions.

Many of the first "Windrush generation" migrants - especially the males, were in the UK prior to 1947 because they were on active service - esp in the RAF.

I don't think it's fair to call the British people lazy, the whole benefit system is a poverty trap.

I'm on benefits myself, and if I get a part time job that earns over £10 a week I lose my housing benefit. For the average Brit, there's temporary full time work available, but if you sign off the dole you can't sign back on for six months.

For the immigrant, they dont need the dole, any money they make on jobs is worth a lot in their homeland.

I'm sorry to disappoint you, but Britain has been accepting (albeit unwillingly at times) migrants from all over the world ever since transport made it possible. Britain has never been 100% British. There may have been a time when it was 100% European, but only many hundreds of years ago - perhaps even thousands.

Hitler's aim was to create a.) a Grossdeutschland, consisting of a German state with all German speakers in it. This meant the control of Austria and the Sudetenland and the parts of Poland taken from Germany in Versailes (and also Memelland in Lithuania and parts of Denmark, Belgium, and France.)

Basically, the theory goes, Britain could have avoided a war either by not declaring war when Germany invaded Poland, or brokering a ceasefire after Dunkirk. This would actually have been preferable to Hitler - no British bombers wrecking German industry, the entire Luftwaffe up against the Soviets, no pressure in Africa. Basically, to win WW2 in real life, Germany needed to knock out either London or Moscow by 1942. Neither happened. Germany got f-ed.

I don't actually think it would have been feasible to keep Britain out in the long run. A German-dominated, autarkic Europe would have done serious damage to our economy, and the Germans showed absolutely no qualms in attacking neutral or even allied countries once they ceased to be useful. Not to mention the moral issues.

I don't see why in the first instance France, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, Scandinavia etc, would cease to exist.

You get people claiming that genetic variation is perfectly continuous and gradual with geographic distance, but the most cursory acquaintance with reality tells us that this is not true. Cameroon is roughly equidistant with South Africa and Algeria, and these countries are arrayed in a line, but the indigenous populations of the sub-Saharan nations are far more closely related to each other than the Cameroons are to the Algerians.

The only worm that turned was a leftist worm that burrowed into people's heads and made them blind to reality. Since population genetics has advanced a lot in recent years racial reality is coming back into fashion, because the leftist nonsense is becoming untenable; so let us hope that the worm will really turn now and that Commie interference can stay out of science for good.

You have effectively been saying that Nazi invasion would be preferable to immigration. I am sorry but in terms of lunacy that ranks at the top. and what makes it even more ridiculous is that you were bitching about how opressive this western liberal democracy is, If you think we are opressed you really need a reality check.

Learn about our system of government and its history and you will see that not everything is supposed to be done with the consent of the people, and that our representative democracy is also in part a way of stopping the people exerting too much power (mob Rule sucks). In short the liberals who think that people power is enshrined in our system are just plain wrong and you are just plain ignorant of our system to actually beleive them.

There already is an organisation called Unite Against Fascism. David Cameron and the rest of the political elite are members / supporters. UAF are hopeless though. Shouting Nazi and Fascist rather than addressing issues which concern the British public isnt going to increase the UAF's support - it just makes them look like a joke.

That's one voter in 100,000. Don't kid yourself. The BNP can drum up rather more support than that. In 2004 it took over 800,000 votes in the European elections and in the 2005 GE it brought in over 200,000 votes.

These numbers, though modest, are bound to rise exponentially as Britain slumbers through a long and deep recession. It'll be interesting to see how they do in the EP and local elections this June.

Think about the taxes they are paying versus the amount of money they are claiming from the state (nil). If they're using public services, think about the fact that they are also contributing to the upkeep of such public services.

Also, how do you propose to impose those 'marriage laws'. In actual fact, part of my ancestry is Indian (Dravidian), the bulk is Persian (Aryan) with a bit of Turkmeni and Portuguese in the mix as well. I have, when I was younger made love to more than one ethnically British woman (but I didn't have children with her). Is it OK for me to do that - as long as there are no children? Or is just the thought of sex between an ethnically British and non-British person horrid? Also when you say 'Indian' do you mean Indian by nationality or ethnicity. The thing is, there is one Indian nationality, but multiple cultures and ethnicities in the Indian subcontinent - e.g. Kashmiris, Punjabis, Aryans, Brahmins, Rajputs, Gujuratis, Marathas, Kannadigas, Andhrites, Biharis, Pathans, Parsees, Bengalis, Assamese, Malayalees, Tamils etc. Is it not ok for an ethnically/nationally British person to have sex/reproduce with a person from one of the aforementioned ethnic groups? And what exactly is the punishment if they do happen to be in a relationship with each other? And how would you seek to prevent such occurrences from happening? Don't you think it would be very difficult? Also, isn't it the human right of the British and non-British individual in question to pursue their relationship/sex life with each other as they please? - rather than having to submit to the BNP's demand to meddle in their private lives. Please let me know.

I don't mind the idea of intercourse between white Brits and certain other races whom we have a lot of similarities with and who are not as great a threat to our native society e.g. Chinese Asians, but the idea of intercouse between a white Brit (especially female) and an Indian (of any ethnicity) or a black person, I do find most unpleasant.

That's not to criticise Indian or black people. It's understandable they would want to fit in more; the white person I would be a bit more worried about.

It wouldn't be that difficult to enforce it by law. It's very difficult to publicly disguise that strong an attraction to someone, so it would be noticed by communities around the people doing it. Of course, it may require some police state-esque measures, but in my opinion that would be for the greater good.

As to your comment about becoming "naturalized," how do you define "naturalized"? Are we really supposed to count people who go round wearing veils and proclaiming 'death to the infidel' messages in mainstream Mosques amongst the natives of our country, just because some corrupt, politically motivated person has ticked their form?

And people of both ethnicities seem to enjoy each other's dress and cuisine so can't see too many problems there!

Also, how precisely have British politicians encourage the 'disintegration' of the British family unit - I imagine that this family unit existed in the past. Also, wouldn't their initiatives also have targeted Indians living in Britain? Wouldn't they also be exposed to influences which encourage the disintegration of family structure? Do politicians stand up and say "Listen up white British people, I would like you to abandon your families, enslave yourselves to alcohol, screw your aspirations and spend your lives dependent on the state. PS. The following advice is NOT applicable to any ethnic minorities, in fact please do the opposite". Thought not. I don't think you can conveniently shift the blame onto politicians.There are surely many ethnically British people who are doing well for themselves and I don't think it's a matter of ethnicity at all, more one of attitude and personal (rather than ethnicity-based) values.

No, but take as an example the strength of Islam and all the hell that kicks off when ever it is criticised compared to how Britain's native religion Christianity gets walked all over and all of the complaints raised by Christians are ignored.

The strength of traditionally British cultures are being undermined while immigrant cultures are strengthening. British people can only turn to mainstream politics or fringe groups like the BNP, which are widely demonised and marginalised, but the non-indiginous peoples of the UK can turn to cultures that have a much greater community and popular strength, and as such avoid the pernicious ideas of mainstream society by clinging to these particular group memberships.

I know some of what I've said is quite extreme. We're all people and individually, I don't have a problem with any race, culture or sexuality. Politics is self-interested, though, and when you feel like you are being attacked, you take to the defensive. If there was any other decent alternative that was put forward, I'd take this into consideration.

I'm perfectly happy for the BBC (or any news organisation, actually) to do undercover reporting. It's important to see what the BNP really say behind closed doors, IMO, and don't see how this has anything to do with adults exercising their autonomy - lying, afterall, is just another part of free speech, and unless it would pervert the course of justice or directly cause harm to people should be legal.

The media try to ruin politicians' careers quite regularly, y'know. It's pretty much one of their jobs.

On the rare occasions that the BNP are permitted on television, they are interrupted incessantly and fettered by the presenter or interviewer.

Look at this disgraceful BBC cnut interviewing Nick Griffin on Newsnight for example <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHRXGld0LkM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHRXGld0LkM</a>

He makes no effort to disguise his bias, and he does all that he can to interrupt Griffin and prevent him from putting his message across.

To be fair, we are already ruled by a party that is fascistic in every sense other than immigration, on which it is only mildly and selectively fascistic. The mainstream response to the credit crisis from all three major parties and the greens and BNP mirrors almost exactly Oswald Mosley's recommendations to the Labour government he was a part of in the 30s for responding to the Great Depression.

That's not to criticise Indian or black people. It's understandable they would want to fit in more; the white person I would be a bit more worried about.

It wouldn't be that difficult to enforce it by law. It's very difficult to publicly disguise that strong an attraction to someone, so it would be noticed by communities around the people doing it. Of course, it may require some police state-esque measures, but in my opinion that would be for the greater good.

As to your comment about becoming "naturalized," how do you define "naturalized"? Are we really supposed to count people who go round wearing veils and proclaiming 'death to the infidel' messages in mainstream Mosques amongst the natives of our country, just because some corrupt, politically motivated person has ticked their form?

</quote>

Why are you 'worried' about who adults choose to sleep with? Look up choice sometime. It's none of your or anyone else's business who people choose to procreate with.

Forgetting for a moment that racial differences are negligible (hence why people from different races can procreate in the first place, which wouldn't be possible if we were so drastically different as people like you like to make out) I do find it laughable that you don't mind Caucasians procreating with East Asians. Presumably the reason you find a White Britons procreating with Indians or blacks 'most unpleasant' is because you want to keep the white British race 'pure'. Ignoring the fact that East Asians are probably more superior than Caucasians anyway in terms of intellect and culturally (seeing as you like to amplify negligible differences between racial groups) and therefore would receive no benefit of mixing with the inferior Caucasians, you will still end up with the same problem of not having 'pure' Britons anyway! Try and be consistent at least! Either call for the none mixing of Britons with any races in order to stop the Britons being presumably 'wiped out', OR just sit back and let evolution takes its natural course. Picking and choosing is just silly.

I was just trying to bring home the point that it doesn't/shouldn't matter if a white person and a black person procreate, or if an East Asian procreates with an Indian. All humans are part of the same species and we know that genetically there is greater variation within racial groups than between them. So what's so bad about interbreeding and the assimilation of races? Why fight natural progression just so that we maintain our own differences which are negligible?

Yeah different races can interbreed because they are neither different species or subspecies. But the same species/subspecies Homo Sapiens Sapiens. Which is another reason race is meaningless, it doesn't even have an adequate means to differentiate, it's in terms of genotype pretty worthless. And I know you think allele frequencies matter but science doesn't, because such frequencies are more diverse within populations than without.

Mass migration? When? Don't you mean immigration?

What you mean like when the government estimated that immigration had saved businesses millions of pounds in jobs that would have otherwise gone unfilled, by English people who refused to lower themselves to such menial work? The fact that we export as many people each year as we import, and our population has remained stagnant for the last 20 years at about 60 million.

The negatives are frankly exaggerated and used to promote what are basically racist ideology masquerading as politics. I've seen it, and it appears reasoned if you don't like actually knowing anything about the subject. Fortunately most people who vote for them are pretty ignorant anyway.

To be honest I don't see that there is a lot to distinguish your views from being either. Perhaps you can enlighten us to why racial purity is an issue, if there is no hierarchy of races, then it shouldn't matter who breeds with who surely, if your a purist you are just fighting for race to be delineated, which of course it already is culturally at least, if not in the field of genetics.

OK, there is one sense in which the term might be legitimate: take Jade Goody for example, a lot of people who do not inspect phenotype too closely might think that she is of fully British descent, but in fact she is ~1/4 negroid, i.e. well outside even the European genetic region. A 1/8 negroid will tend to be somewhat hard to distinguish in the majority of cases. So, you have people who can pass for British/European but are not British/European in genetic terms. In this case, it might be fair to say that racial purity has diminished, although perhaps the term is still inadvisable given its non-scientific connotations.

What I am concerned about is not 'racial purity' though, it is reproductive success, a necessary condition of which is that we do not permit massive non-reciprocal immigration into Britain, or into Europe. Clearly this population movement is occurring; Britons and Europeans in general are being racially replaced. This is not generic race mixing, which I would not necessarily oppose, but replacement.

</quote>

No they are not.

<quote>
As for why I am concerned about reproduction: it seems that this is an internal motivation, like parental or brotherly love for example. It is experienced partly via phenotype recognition, i.e. aversion to alien phenotypes. I do not see why I should have to explain that, any more than people are expected to explain why they would save their own child from a burning building rather than a stranger's child.
</quote>

The problem is of course that the British gene pool is so completely intermixed that it's even more difficult to distinguish any clear identity than it is normally. It's been that way for a very long time and so worrying about who breeds with who is pointless. Most of us are continental European in origin anyway with a mix across the gene pool of several different continents, so who's going to notice? It doesn't make any sense anyway. And genetically racial mixing strengthens gene pools anyway. So who the hell cares?

No one can pass for British European, we're far too bastardised by invasion and colonisation. There's no such thing as a genetic identity that equates to Britishness.

That's not what I said. But an interesting fact is that in a particular town near Hadrian's wall something like 33% of people share and African marker which is thought to have come over during the days of the Romans, when Africans were used to build the wall.

And yes there are different countries in the world well observed. The differences are for the most part not significant except in terms of skin colour and some other less obvious physical differences due to environment, and lets face it that doesn't mean much.

We would have racial reproductive interests even if we were generic Europeans and indistinguishable from Italians and Russians.
</quote>

What is a reproductive interest? And what difference does it make who you mate with. You don't get superior strengthened genes from isolating the gene pool so what is this mysterious advantage? If it weren't for interbreeding from China to India to Europe then most of us wouldn't have the advantageous gene that imbues us with resistance to the plague. The fact is the more diverse the gene pool the better.

And we are pretty much indistinguishable from French/Iberian counterparts, so it's kind of pointless trying to call us identifiably British, except in terms of the fact that is where we originated.

<quote>
We would have a genetic identity, it would simply be a generic European one rather than a British-Northern European-European one.
</quote>

It would have to be a European one, and since lets face it Europe has always been fairly racially intermingled because of its nature of taking over countries across the globe, even that seems like a waste of time. Get over it the gene pool is a mess of multicultural identity and it has been for the best part of 4 centuries. And let's not forget that we actually share a genetic origin with people from Africa's Rift valley, as does everyone on the planet. Which tends to explain why we are all so genetically similar, and makes worthless delineations at least in sciences like genetics a waste of time.

Ethnic minorities fought for Britain. If you don't appreciate that, it smacks of ungratefulness. And pretty good going for those people too, given that they only had their whole nation taken over by white foreigners before. Thousands died too - and if you say anything about somehow they were meant to, or obliged to - that's turning human beings into numbers. Which is dehumanising, and makes you less of a human being.

Because i'm not sure if im on the Electorial Register and therefore am not sure if i'll be able to vote...its all confusing lol.

I think since I was 16 my parents added my name to the electoral thing. So when I turned 18 I automatically became eligible to vote.

BACKGROUND: Theory predicts that lower dispersal, and associated gene flow, leads to decreased genetic diversity in small isolated populations, which generates adverse consequences for fitness, and subsequently for demography. Here we report for the first time this effect in a well-connected natural butterfly metapopulation with high population densities at the edge of its distribution range. RESULTS: We demonstrate that: (1) lower genetic diversity was coupled to a sharp decrease in adult lifetime expectancy, a key component of individual fitness; (2) genetic diversity was positively correlated to the number of dispersing individuals (indicative of landscape functional connectivity) and adult population size; (3) parameters inferred from capture-recapture procedures (population size and dispersal events between patches) correlated much better with genetic diversity than estimates usually used as surrogates for population size (patch area and descriptors of habitat quality) and dispersal (structural connectivity index). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that dispersal is a very important factor maintaining genetic diversity. Even at a very local spatial scale in a metapopulation consisting of large high-density populations interconnected by considerable dispersal rates, genetic diversity can be decreased and directly affect the fitness of individuals. From a biodiversity conservation perspective, this study clearly shows the benefits of both in-depth demographic and genetic analyses. Accordingly, to ensure the long-term survival of populations, conservation actions should not be blindly based on patch area and structural isolation. This result may be especially pertinent for species at their range margins, particularly in this era of rapid environmental change.

General principal of evolution.

That was after five minutes. But I think Pavlik needs a basic lesson in evolutionary biology. Isolated population &lt; diverse population with exchange of genetic material between populations. In diverse population successful mutations are more likely to occur where there is a mix of genetic material. The only process for genetic diversity to occur in isolated populations is genetic drift, a slower and less genetically vigorous method for promoting beneficial mutations in a species, this can lead to gain of advantages, but because of the isolation it also means advantages can be lost. Also the lack of diverse genetic material means mutation and diversity are less likely, speciation may occur but the population will tend to become increasingly specialised and if exposed to conditions such as disease and or environmental changes may be less able to adapt.

I'm pretty sure that no reputable scientist claims isolation is better for species fitness than exchange of genetic material between populations either. It would tend to make evolution false. Anyway lets sum up evolution for the beginner. Evolution is the survival of those most able to adapt. Of prime importance to this is diversity of population and to some extent size of population, which means more genetic traits are developed, leading to it being less likely they will be lost due to genetic drift. Which basically means population interbreeding promotes evolutionary viability. Now you might think that this does not apply to humans, but traits such as lactose tolerance, malaria resistance, plague resistance, smallpox resistance, are more efficiently passed on in terms of diversity through the species by interbreeding between populations and cultures, not by isolation. This is just basic genetics.

Oh and by the way replacement migration is not what happens in European populations. What happens is cultural integration over time, English people aren't being sent to death camps. That's more the racialist style. Start off with a hypothesis that does not reflect population mechanics and then claim something happens that is detrimental. I'm not impressed but then I suspect the paper has been manipulated to support something else? AS usual the science is apt enough but the proviso is entirely specious when applied to the UK.

<quote>
Which modern events affect ethnic genetic interests? This interest is ultimately a matter of population size, which can be directly reduced through warfare, genocide, and the loss of limiting resources such as territory. The fact that a 30 percent loss of population is a 30 percent loss of ethnic genetic interest is obvious. But competition can have powerful effects without any behavior that is aggressive in the usual sense of the word. The prime example in the contemporary world is peaceful migration between states and high rates of reproduction by one ethnic group within multi-ethnic states. Like the bands and tribes in which humans evolved, states are territorially based and act to police their borders. The special quality of a defended territory is that it insulates a population from the vicissitudes of demographic disturbances in the metapopulation, namely the connected phenomena of uneven population growth and migration. When an ethny controls the borders of a territory that is large enough to support the population, loss of fitness relative to other ethnies is not necessarily fatal; it need not lead to replacement. A decimated, defeated, or impoverished population can quickly recover if it retains control of its territory, but a large-scale influx of genetically distant immigrants has the potential permanently to reduce the genetic interests of the original population. Territory adequately defended guarantees continuity and the chance to ride out a temporary downturn in numbers relative to other populations.
</quote>

30% population loss? Er wut? Large scale influx? Er nope.

This reminds me of the usual smoke and mirrors tactic of the BNP. If you want to know what science thinks try studying the field, not reading propaganda from anti immigration/far right web sites. Nice to see the far right is willing to up its game according to the education of the subject though. It's still bs but it's bs with citations, instead of just bs generally foisted off on the average BNP voting mushroom.

Anybody know any genetic biologists on this site? Why not ask them to chime in, assuming they aren't a member of Stormfront, or a collector of Nazi memorabilia.

You'd be right and I am anti BNP, despite being right of centre in my political leanings, probably half way between Labour and Conservative. I think there are bigger problems facing the UK than immigration. And that it's a waste of time chastising the x, when their input is in the main positive. In times of trouble you can always lay the blame at the immigrants door, instead of chastising those who are to blame; for some problems the banks, for some the government, very few problems are due to immigrants, and those there are have existed in this country since the age of colonies. The BNP uses corrupt and faulty reasoning to encourage racial divide, to me they are little more than neo Nazis, with a modern PC veneer.

1) The police beleive there to be about 12 honour killings per year This amounts to roughly 1.5% of murders per year, considering that the population of cultures in which honour killings are likely is about 3.6% of the population, this is not an above average murder rate.

2) 10% of all murder victims are black, only 2% of the population is identified as black despite the fact that the black community are traditionally less likely to the victims of crime, hardly death to whitey really is it.
In 2002/03, the risk of being the victim of a racially motivated incident was higher for members of minority ethnic groups than for White people. Four per cent of Mixed race people, 3 per cent of Asians, 2 per cent of Black people, and 2 per cent of those from a 'Chinese or other' background had experienced a crime they thought was racially motivated in the previous 12 months. This compared with less than 1 per cent of White people.

3) Lets take a tally on how much damage has been done by Catholics through terrorism in the UK and compare it to Muslims shall we.

Overall figures show that ethnic minorities are more concerned with crime than the white population, figures also show that ethnic minorities are more in favour of stop and search policies than the white population

I must say it is quite stupid to point out that the BNP condemn a large proportion of the ethnic population of this country, when in reality there is hardly anything to support their claims, yes there are some muslims who are a danger, just as there are in every section of society.
Lets compare acts of muslim terrorism to acts of Catholic Irish terrorism, yet the BNP are not calling for Catholics and Irish people to be deported are they?

The discrimination and focus on the muslim community by the BNP is unwarranted, they are using them as a scapegoat and in doing so hoping to cause fear, prejudice and the drive to vote for an extremist party that claims it will solve problems that are in the grand scheme of things tiny.

Lets also think back to before 'muserlims dun invaded are countrie'' Oh yes the BNP/NF were using the same tactics, but instead of Muslims they had Jews to use as a scapegoat, anti semitism was all the rage untill the far right had a more relevant 'threat', their opinion on Jews has now taken a full 180 degree turn and indeed members of the BNP consider them allies.

The BNP are media manipulators and liars, There is nothing honest about them, they claim to be the voice of a Britain that no longer exists (and I dont think ever existed). they do not represent the common man but a fringe of society a disgusting underbelly that I hope dies in time.

And I like the way you subtly ignored my other points.

Tell me the BNP's policy on the social issues regarding alcohol, its misuse and its effect, show me their complete detailed analysis, study and policy that has given them time and reason to focus on much smaller issues?

Oh and Howard, thanks for the rep, I didnt know evidence was so scary and would have such an effect on you.

"Clearly Muslims present a grave threat to Britons"

Quite apart from the fact that Britons don't exist, smoking is a grave threat to Britain, heart disease is a grave threat to Britain as is cancer. Muslims are a grave threat to anyone who uses public transport in London and that's about it. Even the IRA had more chance of blowing me skyward than Muslims and they were never considered a grave threat to "Britons".

But come on, comparing muslims and Catholics is ridiculous. At the present time, muslims clearly present a grave threat to Britons. This is most clear from a racialist perspective, but even from average Joe's view, muslims are the ones who are murdering, threatening, rioting...many of them stand for the downfall of our way of life. Catholic terrorism is not an issue in the present day, and they have never posed such a threat, backed up by demographics and widespread hate-preaching, that muslims do today.

A scapegoat for what, muslim terrorism? Are the muslims being used as a scapegoat for that bus and the tube trains that happened to blow up a few years back?

Interesting how pro-Jewism and anti-Jewism are both apparently leftist criticisms of the BNP.

Media manipulators? Because the 'neutral' BBC is oh so keen on the BNP.

What exactly are they lying about? And which other political party is the exemplar of truthfulness?

1) 'Voluntary repatriation' what utter BS, as if it would ever be voluntary, even the BNP activists I met in Stoke said it was BS.

2)Yes all Muslims all over the world are violent rioting murderers. There are actually 2 million Muslims on our streets now, all killing white people...funny thing is I didnt actually hear about this massive civil rebellion.

3)Muslims are used as a scapegoat for problems in the UK, they are used as a distraction so that the BNP dont have to worry about things like policy, strategy, planning, ideas, decent candidates and a grasp on reality.

I dont beleive in political parties full stop and I think they all have gaping flaws, but the BNP are quite frankly the lowest of all of them.

You were trying to draw a parallel between muslims and catholic terrorists, which simply doesn't exist. I'm not claiming that all muslims are violent rioting murderers, that would be an exaggeration, but collectively such behaviour is clearly a muslim trait beyond any reasonable comparison to other ethnic groups.

Why should the BNP have a detailed policy on alcohol addiction and **** like that, when there is a problem of extreme historical magnitude facing us, i.e. our racial replacement, our being displaced from our ancestral lands and ceasing to be?

</quote>

What the BNP says and what the BNP believes are completely different things.

Muslims arent a single ethnic group if you didnt know. 30-40 countries have a Muslim majority and the religion is spread throughout the world, there are sizable populations in east asia, papua new guinea, indonesia and there are 20 million in China. Only 20% of the world muslim population are Arab.

Yeah racial replacement is obviously soooooo much more important than detailed social and economic policies to actually fix the real problems that this country has.

The BNP will preserve our 'race and heritage', but nobody will want to live in an isolated oppressive hell hole ruled by a racist, homophobic, criminal run party that has no idea.

Indeed. The migrations of 1000 years ago had a vastly greater impact on Western Europe than immigration today has <img src="images/smilies/wink.png"/> Remember, France is named after an invading Germanic tribe. The Anglo-Saxon migration had such a huge effect that the traditional British language and culture were pushed back to Wales, Cornwall, Cumbria, and the Scottish highlands.

I know but Goering said that. If you've ever watched anything about Goering you'll know just how accomplished the whole upper hierarchy of the Germans were in propaganda. Saw an amazing documentary/ slash film about the final solution and it's discussion by top brass.

Yes. Very interesting. But the point is that the ancient Britons were a northern European tribe who were invaded for the best part by other northern European tribes. These tribes all melded together over the course of several hundred years and resulted in what we today call "the British" That process essentially ended 1000 years ago with the last major invasion from Europe; that of the Normans.

But, after a 1000 years, the British now face a new invasion of people who are definately not of European stock and many of whom do not share the cultural and social norms of the host nation. That's what concerns so many people.

What does the 'stock' matter? As for 'not sharing the cultural and social norms', I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing in an of itself, because this isn't a "host country"; if you live here it is your country and just because someone else's great-great-grandparents lived here, I don't see why they should get dibs on it. Now, I'm an integrationist, not a multiculturalist, but integration is a two-way process. Look at America, for example, where ethnic groups who were wildly different and often hated each other now get on perfectly well.

The rising popularity is probably just because of some people's fears in the economic climate. They offer a scapegoat for many who are unemployed (or are worried about being unemployed), and that is why their promise of putting British workers first is attractive. However this selfish interest is narrow, and I think their overall policies are unappealing to most people. Therefore I expect their small gains in popularity to decline when the economy picks up.

Do you think this is even possible?

A replacement of 10000 Britons will simply result in the loss of genes equivalent to 10000 Britons in the "British Gene Pool" (since I'm not a mean leftist I'll assume that exist). Which is in turn, 20000 siblings.

But wait, an average Briton actually carries half of the "British Gene Pool" with him?

Anyway, assume you are right. How is the carrying capacity of Britain generated then? No you dont have to answer that. With just the resources on the British Isles its certainly not enough to supply 60 million. Nowhere near.

</quote>

Carrying capacity for territories is a redundant school of thought in the age of mass transportation and a globalised economy. The only limitation is the amount of land that can be used for habitation, and to say that we are overcrowded in that sense is just not true. Britain is not 'full' by any stretch of the imagination.

Research indicates that the UK should only be able to support a population of 17-27 million, yet the white population alone in the UK is far far in excess of that a few more immigrants wont make a damn difference. The BNP's idea of a self sufficient Britain is quite frankly unrealistic at best. This also proves that your bitching about carrying capacity is complete BS.

Our population is falling, and the alien (note this article does not even include Poles etc.) population is increasing. when it says emigration, that means to places like Australia by the way; i.e. we are not replacing Pakistanis and the like in equal measure.

Numerical decrease in population is not the only bad outcome, by any stretch. I believe there are more indigenous north Americans around now than there were when they monopolised the continent, but clearly they have been replaced; in the present day their population is being limited by the millions and millions of aliens who took their country.

I'm glad that we replaced them, but I'm just drawing a parallel here.

But in any case, it is quite possible for our population to permanently reduce in a numerical sense. We have a sub-replacement level birth rate, so our population is slowly receding. Immigrants continue to flood in, the resident aliens have a very high birth rate; so their population increases rapidly. When the country can no longer sustain population increase (it is not as though we have massive increases in carrying capacity to look forward to in the future, as we did in the past; any technology we might create surely cannot ever sustain a much greater population than the existing one), the indigenous people will be fixed at a lower numerical population. Interbreeding will render this permanent before any such time that the situation might change.

At best that is a fancy way of saying that there is such a thing as outbreeding vigour. Yes, but there is also outbreeding depression. There are also racial IQ differences etc.

General racial mixing, with reciprocity, cannot be said to be necessarily beneficial. Mexicans and Brazilians for example are not my idea of attractive, intelligent people. and bearing in mind that a degree of reproductive isolation was necessary for races to exist in the first place, by your logic we should all be cripplingly inbred (hint: we aren't).

I don't know of any prediction, but what we have at the moment is hundreds of thousands of alien immigrants per year; I see no reason why this would change drastically.

<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-547871/More-babies-UK-born-migrant-mother.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...nt-mother.html</a>

More than 20% of children being born in Britain have immigrant mothers; and that statistic completely neglects the massive numbers of second, third, fourth generation alien births here.

This has risen from 13% in 1996. The % is increasing year upon year.

Nope. 30% of the next generation in Pakistan, Somalia, India etc. is not going to be of British origin, or European origin. Recent population movement has been one-sided into Europe and European-derived countries, and it continues to be so.

</quote>

Again why is this a problem? So what if English people are half chad, mexican or Irish, you've failed to tackle the key point. Why should we care? And again why on Earth do you think such figures are going to go on indefinitely? Let's face it I'm not the one with the problem here, your basic understanding of English history and genetics is woeful. And your points are based on a priori assumptions. Europe has had a highly fluid population for its entire history, why should we panic now?

Not only that but do you really think we're going to be replaced by immigrants? Are you that dim that you believe that population ingress is exponential, or what? What about developing countries coming up to speed and thus people returning. What about the fact that most Polish people, come here make enough money and return home to spend what to them is a small fortune? It's very easy to make out that we are in trouble when all you do is cherry pick figures, make up conjecture based on assumption and have no real understanding of the subject further than a bunch of right wing garbage.

I tell you what, I'll bet you £1000 that in ten years things will not be anything like what these sad so called charts and figures say. There's no science here just misinformation.

The Telegraph are you kidding?

Racial IQ differences are you from Mars? Cultural maybe? Jesus I suspect I'm going to be regailed with some junk research like The Bell Curve soon, which has been completely debunked.

Human geography is mapped in the genes

The genes of a European person can be enough to pinpoint their ancestry down to their home country, claim two new studies.

By reading single-letter DNA differences in the genomes of thousands of Europeans, researchers can tell a Finn from a Dane and a German from a Brit. In fact a visual genetic map mirrors the geopolitical map of the continent, right down to Italy's boot.

"It tells us that geography matters," says John Novembre, a population geneticist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who led one of the studies. Despite language, immigration and intermarriage, genetic differences between Europeans are almost entirely related to where they were born.

This, however, does not mean that the citizens of each European nation represent miniature races. "The genetic diversity in Europe is very low. There isn't really much," says Manfred Kayser, a geneticist at Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands, who led the other study.
One-letter differences

Kayser's and Novembre's teams uncovered the gene-geography pattern only by analysing hundreds of thousands of common gene variants called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genomes of people from about two dozen countries. SNPs are places in the genome where one person's DNA might read A, while another's T.

Though the teams worked independently, they used some of the same DNA samples, which were gathered by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline to help hunt for genes linked to drug side effects. The researchers recorded the results alongside the country of origin for each subject as well as that of their parents and grandparents when possible.

For each subject, the researchers decoded half a million SNPs. However, to get an overall assessment of the difference between any two genomes, the researchers used a mathematical trick that scrunched the hundreds of thousands of SNPs into two coordinates, with each person's genome represented by a point. The greater the distance between two points, the greater the difference in their genomes.

When both teams plotted thousands of genomes on a single graph along with their country of origin, a striking map of Europe emerged. Spanish and Portuguese genomes clustered "south-west" of French genomes, while Italian genomes jutted "south-east" of Swiss.

These cardinal directions are artificial, but the spatial relationships between genomes are not. In general, the closer together two people live, the more similar their DNA. The same is known to be true of animals.
Predicting origins

The map was so accurate that when Novembre's team placed a geopolitical map over their genetic "map", half of the genomes landed within 310 kilometres of their country of origin, while 90% fell within 700 km.

Both teams found that southern Europeans boast more overall genetic diversity than Scandinavians, British and Irish.

"That makes perfect sense with the major migration waves that went into Europe," says Kayser, noting Homo sapien's European debut 35,000 years ago, post-ice age expansions 20,000 years ago, and movements propelled by the advent of farming 10,000 years ago. In each case, members of established southern populations struck north.

"A pattern in which genes mirror geography is essentially what you would expect from a history in which people moved slowly and mated mainly with their close neighbours," says Noah Rosenberg, a geneticist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

It would be their numbers that limited our numbers, our genetic representation in the next generation.

Why would we need to our population is fairly stagnant? This is a what if that isn't happening isn't it?

We can enhance the number of people that our territory supports through acquiring external resources, but there is still a carrying capacity. What we import is also limited, we must have something to return, and we must sustain ourselves internally to a certain extent.

Talking of BS, 'a few more immigrants' is complete BS as I showed in my last post, and as anyone with eyes can see for themselves in any case.

Yes but genetic replacement and genetic mixing are two totally different issues, the fact that you repeatedly fail to admit this I can only assume because you don't understand genetics beyond a GCSE level. We are not losing vast swathes of our population to war and famine etc, your study is worthless.

<quote>
You might argue that we reduce our ability to sustain population by upsetting other countries. However note that I do not tend to advocate deporting other Europeans living in Britain, hence we are not in conflict with everyone (incidentally some people criticise the idea that such a distinction between Europeans and non-Europeans is made, whilst also suggesting that deportation would leave us without allies or trade - that is called having it both ways).
</quote>

What does that have to do with the price of fish, our trade relations have never been better? And as you say kicking out all the darkies is not going to enamour us to the global economy, to say otherwise seems a bit short sighted.

<quote>
More importantly, at some point in the future our population can increase again, degree of trade is a transient thing. It is not as though we would be reducing our ability to sustain population indefinitely, whereas if we allow ourselves to be racially replaced to any much greater extent than now, that is a permanent thing.
</quote>

The trend is though to low birth numbers at around 2.00 I don't see that changing unless there is massive development upheaval. Ie WWWIII. Immigrants also will tend to have reduced familly size generation by generation. Also of course the fact that genetic heritage outweighs and will outweigh any immigration simply means we will absorb viable traits and weed out disadvantageous ones. That is genetics 101, you need to learn that isolation is unfavoured by evolution, even in humans. You need a basic education seriously. This is stuff that any A' level student should know.

Here is a map and relevant discussion of that study that newscientist was referring to.

And yet they came up with diametrically opposed views, odd huh? Which do you think I should take more seriously, the peer reviewed journals or some racist blog?

<quote>
The real impediment will not be, in my opinion, technical, but rather psychological/political. The realization that not only major continental races, but also ethnic groups are biological entitites goes against the prevailing politically correct orthodoxy. According to this orthodoxy, European nations are artificial cultural constructions whose members share a "myth" of common origins; they are "constructed" products of the last few centuries; ethnic identification is a subjective notion of self-identity, rather than an objective notion of ancestry and homeland.

It now appears that while European nations are not races, they are, nonetheless, biological populations, occupying specific positions along the Caucasoid genetic continuum, and distinguishable from most other European nations, if not always their immediate neighbors.
</quote>

The real impediment wil be in my racist opinion that this rather puts a nail into the coffin of race, but given the right spin I'll bring people back to my ideology. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooook.

I don't see why you quoted this link, this is in line with sciences ideas that there are no races, only gradations or clines? I don't see what the issue is here? People are much of a muchness in Europe therefore the orthodox establishment is wrong? Er huh? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/dontknow.gif" alt=":dontknow:"/>

Human genetic variation is not limited to Europe, you know.

And if anything it would probably suit your average American WN to be told that intra-European differences are trivial/non-racial.

But to give you an accurate picture of Dienekes's recent opinion on whether European genetic variation is purely gradual:

<a href="http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/12/2008-in-review-ethnicity-strikes-back.html">http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/12...ikes-back.html</a>

"It is now clear that ethnic groups are not only cultural-political formations, but also (at least in part) distinct biological entities, emerging naturally as clusters of similarity from the genetic continuum."

Clusters of similarity. Clustering is fairly evident from that map I linked to actually; for example observe the enhanced similarity of the Northern European (German, Danish, British etc.) populations with respect to geographical distance.

</quote>

Are you saying our atypically low genetic diversity from people who are "European" is a bad thing now? You can't have it both ways? You seem to think there will be a problem that hasn't happened in history and wont? I think you're losing us here? You and this guy seem to be dancing blissfully into contradictions you can't back up.

Do you want to clarify what you are trying to say about genetics in clear language as opposed to the spin that Dienekes bloke has placed on something that says the opposite of what he says. We can identify no distinct race, no ethnic group and no particular ancestry. What we can do though is through analysis find slight increases in certain traits that give a way their ancestral history, so he says that means that biological groups are now viable (biological groups such as in races you mean, or ethnicities? This is pretty poor stuff? I can see why this guy isn't published in a journal).

To put it bluntly there is no distinct race, but there are things like skin colour that might give it away. Genius!

Frankly I doubt many residents of Britain are of the true 'british' race, they'll all be a vast mix of germanic, gallic, norse, celtic and often influences from even further afield.

I've traced my ancestry and it turns out I'm descended from German Jews, English (presumably Anglo-Saxon), Scottish and French.

I highly doubt many other people within the United Kingdom are 'pure' Britain, and if you think otherwise you'll be deluding yourself. In my opinion as long as the laws of this land are respected I couldn't give a damn about the races that live here, and besides, it's proven that breeding with less similar genotypes is beneficial to descendants, so any interracial breeding can only be a good thing as far as the human race is concerned.

It's not a matter of taking me seriously, it's a matter of science. And you clearly don't have the first clue about genetics. Sorry but can you rebut my argument? If so do so, if not don't. As I said I don't think you have the education, and that's not meant to be demeaning, but you've clearly showed you haven't really understood anything I've said or even bothered to respond to it. That is lazy and it wont pass muster. It's D&amp;D, not: my opinion based on nonsensical non peer reviewed garbage.

Right if you want to play: debunk the cited to journal piece, hell start with my arguments from two pages back, so far you've just regurgitated the same old stuff, and not defended counterpoint. J'accuse.

It's your argument and the onus is on you to prove it and defend it. So far you've done neither.

You never answered any of my points, except with the same opinion piece over a study, over and over again, which is clearly refuted by a proper scientific study. Just saying I am right and scientific consensus is wrong is a waste of everyone's time and now you've just resorted to trolling. Still its been fun making you look uneducated and uninformed, but it pales when the person is not prepared to play by the rules of debate, or the forum rules. The onus is on you to produce reputable scientific studies that confirm race or biological identity or whatever weasel words you want to dress it up as is a scientific issue. Not even up to me to show up your crappy sources without any rigorous peer review, up as the opinion pieces and drivel they really are. There is a process in science, that process is there for a reason. And you and people like you my friend are it.

You don't seem to understand either the difference between phenotype or genotype. Or that genetic markers which appear in certain areas are indicative of clines of racial movement and low diversity over all, as it says in that paper which is what that study says. Also since there is still more genetic diversity within a population than over the whole human race, the idea that race is an issue is obviously absurd. Just because someone shares a common ancestry does not mean they share a race you need to get that into your head. Please for god sake study the subject and stop embarrassing yourself with trite propaganda pieces that were destroyed two pages ago, when you failed to answer my points.

See your doing it again your trying to establish that clustering means race or ethnicity. You've jumped the gun and in doing so set up a straw man. Now show me something scientific or don't, I'm not going to take absurd views from laymen on blogs very seriously. Nor should I be expected to.

<quote>
Two unrelated persons in the human population have hundreds of thousands of base pair differences between them in DNA sequence. Previous studies have shown that a small proportion of these sequence differences correlate with a person's continental ancestry: broadly, Asia, Africa Oceana, America, or continental Europe. In the current study, DNA differences within a particular continental group, Europe, were examined. Overall, the analysis of sequence variation allowed the authors to distinguish individuals with northern European ancestry (Swedish, English, Irish, German, and Ukrainian) from individuals with southern European ancestry (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Greek). Interestingly, Ashkenazi Jewish individuals tend to group together with individuals from southern European countries. This study is important because it provides a method of taking into account these differences when searching for genetic variations that are associated with particular human traits, such as disease susceptibility, response to drug treatment, or side effects from therapy. Specifically, these methods may allow scientists to uncover disease-associated genetic variations that might be hidden unless differences related to European ancestry are considered.

For the last time, what are your points? You haven't even constructed an argument that I can criticise, you just posted a study that clearly supports the idea of race and then started the ad hominem again.

There is also much more genetic variation within a nuclear family than between families, as Harpending has shown...does that in any way mean that family and family kinship does not exist biologically or is not an issue?

<a href="http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showpost.php?p=15363990&amp;postcount=371">http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/show...&amp;postcount=371</a> See the bottom of this post.

'Laymen' Lol, you tard. Clustering is only one (albeit important) part of demonstrating the existence of race. Sure, if clustering was random then it wouldn't support the idea of race, but clustering clearly and reliably corresponds to traditional racial categories, and the idea of clustering (as opposed to completely smooth variation) is what we implicitly mean by 'race'.

Furthermore, it does correct a specific thing you implied, namely that variation within Europe is purely clinal. Clinality and clustering are not really mutually incompatible things, but total clinality/gradual variation (implying the absence of any clustering) clearly is not supported by the scientific evidence.

</quote>

This is a waste of my time, you clearly haven't got the where-with-all to understand what I am saying and the fact you are asking for an argument is a bit odd, since if you understood basic genetics you'd have replied to my comments pages ago?

I've given you one, science. It's no good saying some no body reviewed material and decided to buck the trend in science, and hoping that is in fact enough to overturn 40 years of genetic anthropology. That isn't good enough. And my ad hominem are true, you appear to have little or no understanding of genetics by the way you have failed to understand simple arguments. So far your the only one who has resorted to baseless accusations and that's basically because your argument sucks badly, and is at odds with scientific genetic studies everywhere.

Again I ask why is race a scientific issue? And why is what you have shown indicative of race existing, or is it more indicative of population migration, and therefore clines of degree of separation rather than distinct sub groups, just as that scientific study shows? Since we are all related so closely genetically how does having a cluster of similar markers on the gene, say for example blond hair, or blue eyes, or resistance to TB, or just a slight variational commonality in single sequences lead to anything but the opposite conclusion? That populations moved slowly across Europe and tended to mingle with those close to them, leading to remarkable lack of genetic diversity through out Europe. In fact you could say that that isolation due to technological backwardness was actually disadvantageous to our gene pool. This is basic 101 biology.

You claim isolation is better than racial mixing, and you show this with a study that shows genetic replacement on a large scale. Something completely different. You claim clustering is enough to prove race rather than enough to prove someone's ancestry and or likely genetic origin, to prove population differences are significant enough to warrant the term race, and biological simillarities=sub group=race. You even claimed that IQ differs from population to population, or should I say race to race.
None of this is supported though so:

So is that good enough or are you just going to equivocate and prevaricate until you dig yourself out of the hole you appear to have dug yourself into by siding with an opinion and not good rational objective research or scientific consensus. Again the onus is still on you to prove the majority view is lacking and extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof, not a blog, or an article you can pervert with someone's clearly unscientific opinion piece.

I'm horified that people doing a degree in biology or even further have ignored this thread. I guess no one cares about science. Wish I knew someone on here who knows anything about biology, but clearly there isn't anyone, so poor little A' level me has to explain the basics, to what lets face it is beyond racialist ideology. Sad... Oh well. <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>

The only area I can find that race has any applicability to is medicine and in that case it's not really race it's more people from a geographical area with cline gradients even then. And diagnosis isn't even a science anyway.

At least you've stopped calling me a moron.

I will say one thing though you know I don't dispute race politically, therefore culturally and historically. The only issue here is does it belong in genetics. I say no, you say yes. Right or wrong is a matter of consensus in science. The fringes are not a consensus and nor do they indicate that science is making an extraordinary claim. That is another use of exaggeration.

Maybe some of their policies seem rational now, but that only serves as a mask for some of their more extreme ones. I would go as far as to compel people to voted for anyone OTHER than the BNP.

To be honest, our culture has changed a lot since those times due to increased multiculturalism, education, culture etc. I'm surprised this is even big news as you will always get a tiny minority of ppl like that in society. Most ppl know it's BS politics and they prey on certain ppl's ignorance, poverty and social standing to get votes.

So they got a few more now? This kind of thing will die out eventually anyway. Seriously, how many ppl do you know support the BNP? They only seem to come out on the internet and the media! I bet that a large amount of BNP voters don't really know much about their policies and can't even be classed as 'supporters'. They're just making some sort of statement against current government and that's it.

Come on, how long has Britain actually had a flourishing/significant ethnic minority? Not very long and this (the BNP) is just a whimper of a scared and ignorant dying minority. As the generations go on they'll disappear!

Actually I don't need to read that, although I had a look through, seems to be the same stuff I've already read.

My paper says European genetic diversity is low, race or ethnicity is meaningless and that you can establish ancestral movements from markers, because there is such a low genetic diversity in Europe. Case closed or it should be:

This means.
Genetic diversity has not been particularly pronounced in our ~30,000 year history. Mixing of other races, is not significant. Replacement/mixing is insignificant and thus we are all fairly similar across Europe. Using markers such as shared gene ancestry shows cline gradation not distinct races. It's possible to select a tiny proportion of overall genetic DNA to show commonality in markers. This clustering does not mean they share diverse genetics as already established, but because intermixing in societies over history is local and low, it is possible to trace the gradual movement from ME/Asia into Europe by looking at these markers. This does not indicate clustering of genes as a whole, but of a tiny proportion of significant markers.

Overall gene mixing has had little or no difference to our overall gene make up, and there are still more differences in an individual population than as any other population on Earth as a whole (see previous link which establishes this, or any A' level text book). The spin suggested is not apposite and is false when applied to Europe, the evidence strongly shows, see previous link that overall diversity is remarkably light. There is no distinct race in genetic anthropology.
End of story. I agree those contradictory pieces that are so called evidence are being abused to say something they never say or indeed could say. Obviously I wonder what their agenda is as well.

Also I don't have to prove anything, only debunk the worthless mythology on Deineke's site. See above.

Also see previous links from New Scientist and Wiki, and see citations therein. Also buy a bloody biology text book for Christ's sake! <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/>

I know sounds like a total crackpot. Practically everything he tries to establish has no relevance to European population and flies in the face of evolutionary theory. It's almost as if he's trying like a creationist to prove evolution wrong.

I haven't had an answer to my questions, he seems to think that just posting links is an answer. But he's yet to tackle any of my links or questions with anything more than stuff I've already debunked? It's very obtuse behaviour. I really pity him, if someone with any genetic expertise were to tackle him he'd be even more pwned. Sadly there aren't any such people on TSR apparently.

That's erm only valid if you care about minor changes in gene selection due to a small population shift and you think for some reason that it is detrimental to evolution to have gene mixing.

Oh and 10,545 people lost is just ********: 10,000 Bantu, where does this guy even remotely apply this to the real world? People are not being lost in any sense of the word, genetics is simply making populations slightly more diverse over time. However in the long term unless, the population is replaced completely by some disaster, just as in other periods of history where there was significant population upheaval, say Danes to Saxons, or Celts to Romans/other. This will make no overall substantial difference to clines, and we will eventually end up by immigration and repatriation, having still a remarkably similar gene pool.

faulty assumptions include:
Mixing is one way only mixing has a significant effect on our gene make up in Europe. Such an effect is detrimental to population viability. Such an effect is pronounced and long term. Ie the change progresses exponentially. carrying capacities are being reached, when European population is stagnant and in some cases falling. There is no historical evidence to show that mixing causes overall gene diversity to increase appreciably. Migration in Europe is still relatively low across borders, and migration into Europe is never likely to be a significant part of the overall admixture of peoples.
In other words this is simply not a viable hypothesis to say that gene mixing is of less fitness than absolute isolation. Like I say give it ten years and I bet £1000 pounds that nothing like that could happen or will happen according to basic genetic principles, it flies in the face of science. It's propaganda frankly and it isn't peer reviewed for the reason that no good science journal would touch it no doubt.

Same goes for the cline paper and the analysis to produce population ancestries. It clearly says there are no discernible races and European population has always been low. And the wiki says overall diversity world wide is is low between.1 and.5%. Apparently though it is high according to some no body, who hasn't even been able to get published in a reputable scientific journal.

I see no mention of clines in that article. I don't think you've provided me with any other source concerning that study that makes mention of clines.

And there was me thinking that it was a paper with a specific topic. In fact it now turns out that it is a comprehensive refutation of race realism and a critique of Salter as well. I'm impressed.

Might be better to just define cline:

<quote>
In biology, a cline is a gradual change of phenotype (trait, character or feature) in a species over a geographical area, often as a result of environmental heterogeneity. This meaning of "cline" was introduced by Sir Julian Huxley.

Typically, a well-marked cline does not allow for a delineation of subspecies, as it is then impossible, by definition, to draw any further clear dividing lines between populations. In population genetics, a cline could include a spectrum of subspecies, as allele and haplotype frequencies tend to vary over a larger space; moreover, in evolution, genetic lineage sorting usually lags behind the establishment of locally-differentiated phenotypes. Regardless, in neither case will such a variation yield different species, as long as the populations, though geographically spread, can interbreed one with another.

In the scientific study of human genetic variation, a gene cline can be rigorously defined, being readily submissible to straightforward, quantitative metrics; this has apparently not been so of the evidently more subjective concept of “race.”
</quote>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(population_genetics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(population_genetics</a> )

<quote>
cline, in biology, any gradual change in a particular characteristic of a population of organisms from one end of the geographical range of the population to the other. Gradients of characteristics usually accompany, and are responses to, environmental gradients; for example, a mountain range features gradients from top to bottom such as a temperature gradient (colder to warmer) and a humidity gradient (wetter to drier). They may also reflect patterns of individual migration or gene flow. In species of birds and mammals, there is usually a cline in body size, with smaller individuals in warm climates and larger individuals tending to be found in colder climates.

This should be quite clear just using common sense; imagine that humans have just 100 diallelic loci for example, with allele a and allele b. If for 99 of these loci there is an abrupt change, from 10% a / 90% b to 95% a / 5% b at a given boundary between populations, whereas the variation of the remaining allele is clinal, clearly it is still legitimate to regard these populations as different races.

I've already provided a study demonstrating the existence of robust clusters as well as clines in human genetic diversity, this:

Yes but that's not what studies say. Apart from one persons opinion, I showed you that there is no reason to dilineate on the basis of race, but you think you know better than scientific consensus. That's the point, my argument doesn't rest on my opinion, but yours rests on one persons, and that is sad. Salter is not talking about the UK, so it is not an apt comparison and so I have no beef with his research. It's just you seem to think you can apply it to a totally different scenario, which is lazy and negligent. What you want is a paper saying genetic isolation in the UK favours viability. That gene mixing and immigration/emigration does not favour genetic viability. And that there are distinct species in that particular paper, which if you read the NS article and the comments of those scientists who wrote it say the opposite. I don't know how much more simply I can explain it but you really don't have anything but opinion. And opinion is not consensus, unless its a consensus of opinion.

Your just repeating yourself also, like I say you think SNP markers denote race, science doesn't. See previous links. Discussion is pretty much over.

You know yourself that I cannot obtain journal entries without payment. So wiki and other sources such as NS will have to do. I learnt all this from biology text books as well, so I presume you think they are wrong also. I couldn't put up enough material to convince you in a million years, you are too far entrenched in a belief system. So it is and will remain a moot point between us, if not science.

And clustering does not indicate what you think it does. It is small amounts of DNA that show racial migration, and low population motility not significant enough to distinguish into race by anyone inside the field who isn't on the fringe.

Pavlik (IMO) consistantly displays an advanced knowledge of genetics on TSR and has clearly explained it if only you were prepared to listen. I think your mind was closed at the outset, you don't want to consider his points or do any reading.

Returning to the thread title, BNP popularity does appear to be rising and i think the european elections will be a useful yardstick to see if this is happening - particularly because everyone in the country will actually have the opportunity t vote BNP which isn't the case in any other election as they don't have the candidates.

The establishment politics and media are rightfully scared as the BNP don't merely wish to be let into the system, they want to completely replace it. Powerful vested interests thus work hard to keep the party down, worldwide too.

I think most people can feel in their gut (particularly post credit crunch) that the very structure of our society is broken. most won't consider voting BNP but i think there is definately an apetite for change that diddn't exist 5 years ago.

Posting links to the same outdated reports and taking them in the wrong context along with posting conflicting evidence to me isnt the sign of somebody who knows anything about genetics at all thanks very much. Pavlik knows what he has been told by his racist Peers, and that is very little.

What do you mean thay havent had candidates, do you know anything about the BNP or politics? They had over 300 candidates in the 2006 elections, plenty of people had the oppurtunity to vote for them.

Of course they work hard to keep it down, and I praise them for doing so, Extremists of any type shoould be kept down.

Yes our society is broken, and the BNP are a prime example of the decay that is ruining our society.

OK Meus, let's try and get beyond the hyperbole. I don't know a great deal about Islam or Science and these BNP debates (minus Pavlik's comments) are just ridden with rubbish. I know what I believe, but it's nice to hear someone who has a more specialist knowledge on a topic over and above the lay man.

You know a lot about Islam (I would presume), so how would you explain:

- Allegations made by Nick Griffin in the BBC documentary The Secret Agent that Islam allows Muslims to take any woman who is not Muslim by force, guile, or any other means
- Allegations made in Fitna by Geert Wilders that Islamic doctrine at its core encourages violence, terrorism, segregation and discrimination against homosexuals
- Allegations linking the Prophet Mohammed who married a six-year-old as his third wife and consummated the marriage when she was nine to the Muslim grooming of underage white girls going on in the North of England.

(I realise this is getting a bit off-topic...)

Thats such a moronic comment for several reasons.

1) Nobody should be 'kept down' in a free and democratic country - you believing its ok to persecute the BNP (and they are persecuted - job losses for members following the leaked list, general vilification in the media without justification, laws that curb free speech)

2) Just because something is extreme, does not make it bad - you smack of the attitude that 'mainstream is right' - just make up your own mind about what is correct regardless of its popularity. it takes a greater man to poke his head out against the prevailing wisdom than a man who retreats to the safety of conformity.

A good example would be the people who were warning of the asset bubble pre-credit crunch. They weren't listened too, they were 'extremist'. They challenged the happy ignorance and greed of those years and were scorned as doom mongers. They were right.

Same with immigration, the BNP are warning everyone that it is fundamentally unsustainable and damaging to our long term interests. The establishment wish to perpectuate it for their short term game and nobody questions it. Again i believe the BNP will be proved right. Except in this case we're not talking about the loss of wealth, we're talking about the irreverisble destruction of a people. WE DONT HAVE TIME TO LET I PLAY OUT. IT CANT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE.

Yes our society is broken, and the BNP are a prime example of the decay that is ruining our society.

How so, they have not been in power at all. Unlike new labour and the tories - they are the reason our society is broken. Broken by a systematic attempt to deindustrialise this country, sell of its assets (energy, rail, water..... even now the royal mail!) to foreign multinational companies, sell of our gold for a pittance.... the FAKE low unemployment through promotion of idleness and the benefits culture, the destruction of the once proud working class and their later neglect as an unwanted people in their own land. Our banks are also throughly udner the thumb of foreign interests in the form of foreign soverighn wealth funds, investment houses and BANKSTERS.

Woodrow wilson said it himself ' those that control the credit of a nation control its destiny'. We no longer control our destiny.

Lib, lab, con they are all the same. The only future for the british people is to sweep them all a side in a nationalist revival. We need to build a national state in a manner similar to that britain was run immediately after WW2.

We must unite together to form a strong, sustainable nation.

-Allegations made in Fitna by Geert Wilders that Islamic doctrine at its core encourages violence, terrorism, segregation and discrimination against homosexuals
</quote>

Islam is very specific when it comes to homosexuality, as all the Abrahamic faiths. It does not have an issue with homosexuals, but the act of homosexuality itself. If you want to know what Muslims would be upset by, a group of homosexual men, or two homosexuals having a sex life it would be the later. The act is a capital offence but the death sentence is not encouraged or relevant to the public at hand. This is something many people do not understand. The only authority which comes closest to sentencing someone to death is a court, and courts demand evidence. For example, adultery is a capital offence but you need 4 credible people to witness the act. Having three people walk into the room to see you with your mistress means your as good as innocent. So the idea of "terrorism" or violence in the context of senselessness (although I suppose you will argue the focus of the act of gay sex is itself senseless) isn't true in that sense.

<quote>
Allegations linking the Prophet Mohammed who married a six-year-old as his third wife and consummated the marriage when she was nine to the Muslim grooming of underage white girls going on in the North of England.
</quote>

The Aisha (ra) marriage is something of controversy and its complicated to explain, but to summarise it, there are two points to be made from it. 1) Was she a child in the sense we know children as, and secondly, does that marriage condone any relationship between children in our society and adults. I think the second point is more relevant, and the answer to that is heavily based on the first. Short answer would be No.

If you'd like more info on any of these points, please PM me or post in the Ask A Muslim thread and direct me to that post and we can discuss it there. But I just want to take this time to thank you for being considerate enough to actually verify the things you hear about Islam rather than take as factual as so many here do.

No its not a moronic comment as I dont beleieve or support modern western democracy. though I do beleive in moderate centrist policies both economic and social. I am obviously not just a follower of the manistream as I just denounced one of its fundamentals. So take your assumptions and misguided judgements somewhere else.

Oooooh credit crunch....you managed to include a current event. I am sorry but recessions and collapses happen, they are normal in a capitalist society, get over it. Much of the credit crunch is now over and whats screwing up our system now is cynicism and a lack of consumer confidence, bitching about how bad things are and how we are screwed MAKES THINGS WORSE, personally I think a great deal of this could have been avoided if governments were able to tell the media to shut the hell up, there is no question sensationalist reports and the counter productive work of parties like the BNP made the credit crunch far worse than it is.
I just like the way that you blame everyone, apart from the lazy British public itself. Its not everyone else, the British public should take some goddamn responsibility, if people didnt spend more money than they have, and had some self control and self respect we wouldnt be in this mess

We needed to de-industrialise, we were unable to compete with other countries like china, unless the BNP were willing to screw over workers rights in a gargantuan fashion ensuring cheaper labour they would have had to do the same.

Dont talk to me about unsustainable, as I have said before our population, even with immigration is far far far above what Britian could self sustain. the UK can support about a maximum of 27 million people (the higest maximum estimate) and be self sustaining, Are the BNP willing to kill off half of the white native population? no they arent! Britain cant survive without the foreign interests.

You obviously havne not noticed the massive wealth transfer from west to east, we are a big debtor nation now and we used to be a creditor. The country being in debt is bad for all the reasons that personal debt is bad.

if that is true then why does germany, a very similar modern western country with gdp per capita similar to ours still have a strong manufacturing economy?

It is true that some of our industries were inefficient and uneconomic and needed to go. The drive to deindustrialise our country on the other hand is mostly an ideological and politically driven change. We are left now with little means to generate wealth. What do we have that we can sell to the world? we have sold off most of our REAL assets, finance is now in a huge mess... what do we have to sell to pay back our debts..?

Sorry, you seem to be implying that migration makes as more sustainable. It doesn't it makes us less sustainable.

And yes, the BNP would stop unsustainable population growth and aim to reduce our population to a sustainable level. This would be done with balancing of immigration and emigration, birth rates and death rates in such a way to slowly reduce the population to the right level.

Yeah, but homosexuals commit homosexual acts – that or live lonely lives. Saying you only condemn the act is like Wilders saying he condemns Islam but not Muslims.

Since when has a capital offence not equated to the death penalty?
Why should active homosexuals be punished anyway?
How would you respond to all of the other allegations made in Fitna linking central Islamic thesis to terrorism?

People are generally OK as individuals, but when you get people in groups of likeness, you get a survival mentality especially with groups competing for limited resources. We're all a threat to each other in the real world. You can have all the understanding and knowledge in the world, and still never achieve peace.

I have disputed his points scientifically, it's just like Pavlik you don't really understand how. There's the problem. Pavlik is all mouth and no trousers. He's not answered a single dispute I've had with his conclusions. I could talk in fancy language if you'd like. Say allele distribution amongst genetic clinal gradation is correlated with geographical distribution. But to be frank I doubt he would understand it, and since he wont answer when I put it laymens terms what chance do you think I have in science speak?

Plus the guy has better things to do than argue with people who don't know anything about biology.

So here's a question if allele groupings are correlate well with clinal gradation, why is it that you insist the clinal model is invalid, on the basis of localised clustering, which again is a clinal model and as the paper said based on co-ordination of range or clines itself to say the opposite?

What chance do you think I have of getting an answer. Also what does 1in 8 actually mean, we share 1 in 8 of our genes identically with anyone else on Earth? Is that a plus point? It may be that we differ by only.2-.5% overall genetic material, and it may be that we use a migrational model to interpret clines. But saying we are similar because we are localised is a whole 'nother world away from saying there are races. In fact it's a different ball game. The evidence he has is used to show gene flow in clinal models, or migration out of Africa or elsewhere. Using it to show something else, is an abuse to science. It's also completely out of whack with modern thinking. But then do you think Pavlik understands or cares about that?

Did you understand enough of that to dispute it? Do you think Pavlik does? Or do you think he's just parroting propaganda? There's your problem. He'll explain what it says in the paper, but he hasn't the education to dispute criticism. That is all too clear.

Having debated with Pavlik before, the genetic arguments really are not the principle point of contention. Even if you concede that skin colour &amp;c. is an adequate condition to decide a generally significant genetic difference (and I really don't know enough to comment on that), it remains to be demonstrated that such a genetic difference in some way justifies forcibly segregating genetic groups. Pavlik has never presented any satisfactory justification in any of the debates I have had with him.

What scientific consensus? Which one of us refers to scientific studies, and which one is just repeating his opinion ad nauseum?

He's talking about any instance of uneven mass migration. Perhaps you should read On Genetic Interests before you start claiming knowledge about his work, anyway.

Well finally you've expressed something in an intelligible manner; so you are saying that an individual of one ethnic group cannot be confident that he is genetically more similar to his own ethnic group than to another.

Clearly though Salter has to use the average values that Cavalli-Sforza provides. The data is not meant to imply that a given English individual might not actually have ethnic genetic interests that reside in the Serbs rather than the English, for example.

At the time that the paper in my sig and the subsequent book were composed, there was no suitable study concerning how often individuals have greater affinity with another race than their own.

However I provided that recent Witherspoon et al study, which tells us that Europeans are never more similar to negroids or east asians, whereas it gives a figure of 3.1% for how often individuals are more similar to non-co-ethnics when more intermediate and admixed individuals are included in the comparison.

Bearing in mind that this comparison included such obviously similar groups as Africans and African-Americans, this result is a bit too general for my liking; but let us assume that a Briton is most similar to an Indian 3% of the time, for example. Firstly, what is more important is whether he is closer to the British or to the Indian population centroid, not if he is occasionally more similar to random Indian individuals; because mass migration is naturally an issue of population averages, not individual interactions.

The study shows that in general this centroid measure decreases faster than the individual similarity measure as more genetic loci are added to the analysis, so in this example it seems reasonable to postulate a lower incidence of Britons being more similar to Indians in general; say 1%.

Now I do not see this as being an obstacle to the idea of a Briton siding with his co-ethnics. He might not be acting in his reproductive interests, but the risk seems rather small. Furthermore in our present situation, it seems likely that any Briton would benefit from non-Europeans in general being removed from the country; bearing in mind that the aliens will include many negroids etc.

As for how often a Briton is more similar to a Pole for example, that frequency may well be somewhat high; let's say 15% of the time. I still do not see the objection to a Briton, in the absence of further knowledge (let's be realistic, not every Briton can be tested along his whole genome to find this out) assuming that his genetic interests do reside within Britons rather than Poles.

But as I said that is not a particularly relevant concern anyway, since Poles are not by any means the primary demographic threat that we face.

</quote>

Here's a classic example. He spent five paragraphs saying that Africans are different to Europeans. And none answering the posit that if there is more intra population deviation of gene alleles, than inter population deviation of any group in the world, that indicates sufficient criteria to dilineate the races based on geographical location/ genetics? The answer is as it says in my first link: no. Absolutely not. Still not had an answer to that. So just saying Africans are 3% different from Europeans and 1% different from indians means absolutely nothing. And isn't worth debating. It's simply saying that clinal gradation is not significant but in 5 paragraphs not 1 sentence.

In answer to collingwood, I agree, if he could present something other than negros are black. Or evidence for the out of Africa hypothesis and is support of clines, it might make a difference and I am educated enough to know that that is no basis for distinction, in fact anyone with a GCSE probably knows that. As we know though, there isn't an argument in science that is accepted that disputes the clinal variation or gene flow model. So we're asking him to give something that isn't out there assuming that he could even present such research if it existed. We can all manipulate statistics to make totally opposite conclusions to the original paper. That is bad science though, and I don't see why we should accept such manipulation from people with an obvious agenda.

So basically you are admitting that you have no grounds on which to base your argument at all, nobody is saying that the races arent different, they are. But you have not produced any real reason at all to justify segregation, other than the fact that you dont like foreign people, which is racism not racialism.

And a persons reproductive interests are their own, Why do you choose to presume that you have the right to judge others on how they want to use their genetic code? Its none of your buisness unless (which you have denied in the past) you claim custodianship over peoples DNA, their very existence, the things that makes a person unique.

I was with you up to there, the information should be available. It doesn't weaken the argument, in fact in the wiki, the source has been successfully argued against by science since its inception. In science that which does not kill it makes it stronger, that is as true for science as it is for the purposes of evolution. You need to quit thinking that science is an arbitrary monster, if the evidence was substantial enough then it would win out. That is the way it works. However the incumbent is not dethroned by small arguments but by significant ones from a consensus usually that gains momentum. Thus Bohr, Heisenburg, Pauli etc defeated Einstein, Schrödinger and others to secure a place for quantum mechanics after 20 years of dispute and intellectual in fighting.

The only people who decry science for being closed minded and blinkered are crackpots. Usually because they are rightly discriminated against. I'd rather science was relatively intransigent than willing to accept any old hypothesis. That seems a wiser way of proceeding particularly with all the nonsense out there since the advent of the interweb.

We can still pretend that morality makes sense (moral fictionalism) and in that case I think we have to construct formally valid ethical systems; that is perhaps a worthwhile task, but as an initial point any kind of idea that morality provides a compelling argument against racialism is invalid.

I think people can find meaning in the idea of reproduction - we clearly are reproductive entities - and it is certainly the case that such information as Salterism is not widely available to the public right now, so it is highly beneficial if people can be made aware of this information regardless of what constitutes a complete argument.

People do argue a lot about Salterism, by the way, including yourself. If a person said 'Yes, I can see that race is a significant reproductive interest, that races exist, and that a stance of deporting non-Europeans and ending all mass immigration thereafter is theoretically optimal for a British individual who wishes to maximise his reproduction - but I personally would not like to see this scenario enacted' then I would have little dispute with them.

Because anti-racists can see that this scenario leaves them weakened, they try to argue.

</quote>

No people dont argue a lot about salterism, people like you try and use an outdated, rather low grade single piece of work as evidence to justify your blatant racism which forces people like me and others who know more about genetics to tell you that it is BS. You have no real evidence to back up your claims and since you have just dismissed morality you dont even have any half assed moral argument to fall back on.

Optimal reproduction could only be acheived (if your misguided ideas are correct about these HUGE racial differences) by promoting inter racial reproduction widening the gene pool and gathering the 'distinct' characteristics of all races into one hence creating a more hardy unified species with a much better chance of survival.

Fair enough, but I think this just causes you other (more serious) problems. If 'might makes right', then why aren't the left-"liberals" justified in progressively banning the BNP and forcing people not to be racists? Or even in killing you?

Further, I think we can fundamentally disregard morality and still have problems justifying the link between racial differences and support for segregationalism -

<quote>
So I am quite content simply to demonstrate that racialism, such as the variety provided by the BNP, serves a British individual's reproductive interests. Reproduction is a meaningful thing, and it is a fundamental process of life. If people see the relation here, they might see that racialism is something they are not ashamed to participate in, and they might be inclined to cast off the anti-racist ideas.
</quote>

I simply don't think this defence works the way you want it to. Suppose that the presence of other races in the British Isles does disadvantage you in trying to get a partner with whom to have children. Couldn't the same be said of any man with a more attractive physique or personality than you? Or indeed men who are presently in relationships, thus 'blocking' you from potentially having children with their partners? Why, then, shouldn't you advocate deporting all these people, rather than jsut the non-whites? Wouldn't the presence of non-white women actually increase your chances of passing on your genes (or at worst make no difference)?

No they are unwilling to gradate races in biology and anthropology, everywhere else it is a valid concern. People have an understanding that culture or race exists broadly, so whether a scientist categorises on that basis is neither here nor there really in terms of the BNP.

There is no evidence that intelligence is a racial issue either. For a start IQ is not accept as an intelligence test, so there's no way to test it in a way that is unbiased by social development and education and economic class. The last book to try was funded by a racist organisation and it was debunked despite receiving initially positive reviews from scientists. Physical differences are much easier to prove than intellectual differences. And that isn't a vast left wing conspiracy either that's just the fact that psychology is such a young science and psychometry is currently a rather blunt tool.

It is not outdated in the sense that it has been refuted in any way, either.

As for the studies that support race realism in general, they range from recent to very recent indeed (i.e. last year). In fact probably the best paper yet came last year, and as I discovered recently you can access it for free if you take 2 minutes to set up an account with sciencemag <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/319/5866/1100">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/conten.../319/5866/1100</a>

2003 is actually outdated. In medical and current scientific research using a source either 6 or more years old is considered bad practice especially in the medical field which you will agree is closely linked with genetics.

And the best paper you mentioned, shows how we are all related to common ancestry, and though there has been genetic drift in populations resulting in different races it in no way validates your claims that races should not interbreed, in fact it shows quite the opposite, it shows that we are very closely linked.

The fact is, calculating the child-equivalent losses from replacement migration is a fairly simple bit of mathematics once the formulae have been derived and the global genetic assay has been performed. It only took someone to bring together these things and write a paper/book on it; although let us not forget that OGI provides rather a lot more than simply tables of child-equivalents. And in general the studies that have come out since 2003 regarding our perception of biological race have only reinforced the validity of Salter's work.

It is not as though there is anything in On Genetic Interests that is especially prone to becoming out of date, unlike (perhaps) certain cutting edge medical research.

When have I ever claimed that interbreeding, in and of itself, is harmful to our reproductive interests? It isn't - it only might be, given certain conditions or circumstances.

Again I think you might benefit from actually reading about how replacement migration damages our reproductive interests.

</quote>

You whole theory is based on replacement migration 1:1 no matter how much you say it, it is theoretical. It is not the same in reality, 1:1 migration doesnt happen as it would ensure a stable population. We see from reality that the population is changing and that replacement isnt actually happening 1:1.

You misunderstand fundamentals of race difference, in reality the differences between race are tiny, they are unbearably small and dont actually matter.

So if interbreeding between races isnt a problem and doesnt damage reproductive interests what the **** is your problem? why would anybody care? what does it matter? you are supporting the pointless division and segregation of the human race.

I've read it immigration/emigration in the UK does not seem to be either the sort of replacement he is talking about in that paper nor does it show that such an area is suffering consequences. So it's kind of irrelevant. In scientific study to take such a paper and use it to label a totally different set of conditions isn't considered bad form it's considered not even worth the time of day. Let's at least keep the subject on something that is linked to the OP.

That's the issue I had, you seem to think I had an issue with the conclusion though. That's not the case, if population is destroyed and replaced in significant numbers without any cross breeding or breeding between groups then of course it is going to be detrimental. No one denies that.

Hilarious. Just what is the Bantu population of the UK? And are they sleeping with our white women, if so should we lynch them or send them home?

Sorry but it's hard to take such stupid rhetoric seriously without a paper on immigration and emigration specifically, not pure bolonium grade supposition.

The actual supposed science is fine, saying that such things are happening and proving such things are happening, is another ball game. Just like clines and race.

I was right Salter is obviously a racist as well as a racialist if that sound bite is anything to go by.

Clearly Salter is not a raving leftist, I'll grant you that; but OGI is not written from the perspective of any ethnic group in particular, and for example strategies for mixed-race individuals are discussed. That quote is a factual statement, and he goes on to say that the reverse applies (naturally); there is nothing political about it save that it might upset some leftist pseuds.

</quote>

I'm right wing myself and it upsets me. Although I admit I'm a bit libertarian on some issues, but that makes me even more right wing technically.

Salter sounds like someone who has some sort of agenda though, from what I have read, I'm not sure what it is, but then I haven't read the book. Perhaps he's just a Daily mail reading hard right Conservative, with a grudge against science? Or perhaps he's genuinely trying to save science from itself, who knows? Frankly though, cynical as it may seem (and the fact that I think science doesn't need saving) I think he's probably a little bit racist, and a lot racialist.

My advice read a bit more than Salter and Witherspoon or whatever there names are. Controversial and fringe doesn't mean true any more than mainstream and peer reviewed (it does mean its been rigidly scrutinised by more experts though).

I will assure you though that the book is really a million miles away from being any kind of 'racist' screed. There are no special appeals in it.

What you don't seem to appreciate is that these papers I provide by Witherspoon et al and so forth are the primary and best studies that exist dealing with various aspects of human genetic diversity.

It seems that people tend to imagine scientific output on a given subject being much greater than it actually is; there are not 10 studies per year that come out on the subject of e.g. how often individuals from different races are similar to each other, there are a mere handful in total and the Witherspoon study is the most recent and clearly the most accomplished one (based on how many loci were studied).

'Cherry-picking' to support a position would not be easy at all.

</quote>

And yet you managed it. Salters position does not apply to the UK. And the source paper, and its scientists reach completely different conclusions to Witherspoon.

There are hundreds of papers on anthropology that come out every year on a variety of subjects, none of them AFAIK use the term race, except in passing. Nor I think is there any need for institutes of anthropology to change that policy.

<quote>
It tells us that geography matters," says John Novembre, a population geneticist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who led one of the studies. Despite language, immigration and intermarriage, genetic differences between Europeans are almost entirely related to where they were born.

This, however, does not mean that the citizens of each European nation represent miniature races. "The genetic diversity in Europe is very low. There isn't really much," says Manfred Kayser, a geneticist at Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands, who led the other study.
</quote>

Pretty much says it all, and Witherspoon is if you ask me on the wrong page.

What the hell is universal nationalism? Anything with nationalism in tends to sound dodgy though. It's like a necessary evil you have to go to to get to democracy.

Yes you appear to have missed the part where I compared Britain to Britain as well. The point is terrorism doesn't and never has respected borders.

Cells would operate in the UK with or without legality regardless of immigration policy. Why would that suddenly change over night? Did Israel make terrorism a thing of the past by refusing to allow Palestinians in?

That quote I gave from Goering is quite apt, you can make idiots do whatever you like, all you have to do is make them believe they are being threatened, and that those who speak against them are unpatriotic, it does indeed work the same anywhere.

Put it this way Israeli Jew, Muslim with history of living in Europe, impossible to tell the difference. What are we going to do exactly, restrict anyone who looks mildly foreign from entry because they are 1 shade darker than white. You know like the Mexicans, the negroids, the Chinese. Because there are Al Qaeda cells in almost every predominantly Muslim nations, it wouldn't take much to start recruiting some rather oriental looking Muslims either and of course they already have black operatives.

But unfortunately Britain's risk of terrorism is home grown. Al Queda do not need to send terrorists to Britain; there are many people already living in Britain who are willing to do their bidding.

Of course I see them, they are always around. But passing as European in general and passing as British are two different things. You put a bunch of Turks together though and they have trouble passing as any Europeans, let alone Britons.

There are not many Muslims who have a history of living in Britain at all, excepting Albanians and some Russians, who do not really pose us a threat like Middle Easterners, Pakistanis etc. do (and we are not going to allow them into Britain anyway).

The IRA are indistinguishable from us though. And they live next to us.

But yes, maybe they could pull off the odd thing somehow. But terrorism would cease to be any kind of major problem. If you think we are incapable of stopping the vast majority of any immigration (particularly of people who do not look like us) and periodically ejecting those who made it through the first stage, you are wrong.

It is quite possible to ensure that the vast majority of temporary visitors are just that, especially bearing mind that the public in a BNP Britain would not have the same ideological make-up as today (i.e. they would be vigilant).

I genuinely can't believe how naive you are.

Do you really think that we can stop terror at the doorstep. And not only that many of the terrorists weren't even Pakistani. This is shockingly unreflective lunacy to believe terrorism can be made to respect borders, when it has never done so in history. Yeah of course MI5 have a special paki detector, or cypriate detector or Saudi detector, that sniffs out Muslim genes and can track them down to a location anywhere in the UK, no matter how they enter legally or by boat from Norway.

Honestly its a nice slant on the we are threatened and will be less threatened honest under the BNP, but its garbage. You can't inhibit legitimate business and diplomatic movement into a country without destroying trade. And terrorists can quite happily pose as either diplomats or businessmen. The Iranians have had a history of using either or both as do Al Qaeda although mostly through business contacts. Believe it or not some of the most dangerous terrorists in terrorist organisations have set foot on English shores with or without legal entry, and they will continue to do so, with or without permission from The Queen.

'Terrorism doesn't respect borders' is a nice catch-phrase, but it's only true if there is no border control.

I have a Pakistani/Saudi detector. It's called my sense of sight (and smell <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":tongue:"/> ). Do you think they can live and organise terrorism in Britain without letting anyone see them?

I've never heard of Cypriate terrorism, I can't see that ever being a major problem for us.

Businessmen and diplomats, whose temporary residence in this country will be checked, simply are not going to pose us the same problems as a generation of millions of Pakistanis going to the likes of the Finsbury Park Mosque in London every day. That is naive.

How many people does it take to operate a cell? do you think that sending the problem to mainland Europe or elsewhere is going to stop them from operating in the UK? Has it ever stopped terrorism. Is it really going to be reduced, and are we actually under any more threat than we were under the IRA. No we are not, and despite these lunatic measures you condone we never will be. You said yourself we can keep a check on business people, what all of them. Every Muslim business man who enters the UK? Do you have any idea how much that would cost? And we still haven't tackled the problem of all those entering illegally, which lets face it is not hard to do when you have one of the longest coastlines in Europe. Now onto tourism, so we ban any Muslim from entering the UK on holiday too, isn't that going to be a tad expensive, or would it be more expensive to monitor every single tourist too? Who's paying for these policies? Are we going to ramp up taxes to offset these huge financial losses?

If you think that is too expensive, what about the money that is wasted on anti-racist initiatives, combatting home-grown terrorism, catering for asylum seekers etc. now? The cost will not be overwhelming by any means, especially bearing in mind that maintaining borders should be a primary function of the government.

Bear in mind also that nothing is so expensive once you dispense with extensive legal rights for aliens.

Also you might stop to consider how appealing the prospect of illegal immigration to Britain will be, when the punishment for plotting terrorism is death and you are not at all welcome in the country (facing very likely and uncomfortable deportation). It won't be like it is now.

You are just thinking from your perspective of how horrific it would be if Britain was actually returned to Britons. Your arguments are not made from a rational perspective, methinks. Practically, it is not impossible by any means for a people to maintain territorial monopoly over their country and defend themselves against the incursions of others; the main obstacle would be liberal attitudes such as your own, not economics or anything like that. If Zimbabwe can manage it, so can we.

</quote>

Every time I ask you a question you fail to tackle many of the points.

Since this is getting tiresome: what about tourism. There are 1.5 billion Muslims in the world, more than a 5th of the total population, do we bar them all?

How do we police a 3000 mile coastline and keep them out, didn't work for the IRA, and we only had the Irish sea to patrol mostly.

The main obstacle would be financial ruin that imposing restrictions on free trade and tourism would cause. Not to mention making England an extremely unpalatable destination for Muslim business. Which let's face it is substantial. It's got nothing to do with liberalism any more than anthropology has to do with the BNP. It's common sense, and for the third time I am not a liberal. I just don't see the point of getting fussed over immigration policy beyond what the Conservatives suggest.

I'm afraid you can't silence me just by citing the Daily Mail and hoping the facts will go away. There are 4000 British muslims who have received terrorist training in Afghanistan and Pakistan and that remains true however much you protest. That should be enough to concern any reasonable citizen and not just "frothing at the mouth" nationalists.

As for whether the IRA did more damage - well, for a start they were operating for 30 years so that's not surprising. But the 7/7 bombings killed more in one fell swoop than any IRA mainland bombing so the muslims are clearly off to a good start.

Lol. Er nah, the IRA killed about 300 civilians. One bomb in Manchester in 1996 did far more damage than 7/7 about 1.5 billion in damage, with over 200 people injured, some seriously.

Perhaps I didn't make myself clear enough. What I meant to say was that the 7/7 bombings killed more in one single event than any IRA mainland event. In fact, the 1996 Manchester bombing you mention, though being 3000Ib and the largest "spectacular" on mainland Britain killed precisely zero people. This is maybe because the IRA habitually gave coded bomb warnings to the authorities allowing for evcuation.

I know when the IRA were operating to. They were formed in 1969 and operated until the late nineties. That's 30 years. Isn't that what I said?

Yes it's about an order of magnitude of 1,000,000 times harder. I know. I still find it amusing that you think we can keep everyone out, that creases me up. What about all the drugs that are in this country that didn't go through the legal channels. Laughably short sighted policies.

Yeah my life revolves around teaching racists to appreciate the fact that there's more than life to living in a bubble. I think to be honest we've got the meat of the BNP here, and the fact that some people haven't the slightest idea what they are talking about. Multiculturalism is evil, yeah we get it. Pity we don't get it enough to vote in anyone that backward and ignorant.

A plus is that we have much better forms of government who live in the real world, they may be ****, but they aint half as clueless as the alternative. It's like trying to teach communists to appreciate the right wing, or libertarians of either wing that there system is so bad that it would only work in Utopia. To sum up, the BNP are a magical fairy tale party, long on ideas but short on pragmatism.

It's a good question I've asked it several time and got no answer. Apparently it's bad to be multicultural mmmkay. Multiculturalism is bad mmmkay. Negroids are bad mmmkay. They are stupider than us mmmkay. Mixing gene pools is bad mmmkay.

The Labour party messed up when it tried to go to far against the when in Rome policy, and wanted a melting pot not a distinct cultural nation. But let's not get carried away and throw away people that have contributed a considerable amount to our economy, and no doubt our gene pool.

No offence but if the BNP could win on sheer hot air they would of been in power 10 years ago. It's all just rhetoric, underneath we can all see that it's rotten from the inside.

Well, let's put it this way. When you have children, you will want to raise them to be well mannered, polite, moral citizens. Then somebody comes along claiming your morality is wrong and theirs is right and then your child, let's say your daughter, is brainwashed into their corrupt, alien culture and turns against yours, your parents and your ancestors' national, highly evolved culture to become more like an alien than a daughter to you. That'd be ****** up.

Incidentally, I dispute your point Pavlik point that morals don't exist - they may be social constructs, but the culture and morality a nation develops for itself is its life blood and its strength. You said yourself that multiculturalism decreases acts of altruism because you don't feel a common sense of brother- or sister-hood with your neighbour, because your neighbour has a lot of ideas that are down right destructive to your culture and decent way of life.

In a nation, where the indiginous citizens don't have any sense of morality or national culture and sense of moral brotherhood, the cockroach infestation of immigration thrives and takes over and polutes society with Islam and other diseases which aim to wipe out all that is good about the indiginous population.

That's ridiculous, you call me a fascist because I'm not a race-obsessed hate monger?? I have an issue with white supremacists the same way you have an issue with "non-Europeans", difference is that I'm not as insecure as you and other pro-whites who have nothing but their skin colour to hold on to..

Anti-racism is pretty standard, racism is bad and that should be glaringly obvious to anyone with half a brain cell.. but I forgot I was talking to a twisted bible-bashing KKK <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

Anti-racism is not based on paranoia or fear of social tension, it's based on a simple principle that people's skin colour has nothing to do with their personalities, attitudes etc.

The strength of a nation has never developed from its blood alone, if that was the case then the Romans would never have taken Europe. A nation develops from being open to new ideas, tolerant of those who have different ideas, and democratic about which ideas should be tolerated. Without that you have authoritarianism and we all know that doesn't work.

Another straw man. We are not a criminal nation, we have one of the safest countries in the EU. And we also have a distinct culture? It may not be your brand of culture, but we're hardly in the gutter. In order to be there we'd have to invite the Nazis back into power, formerly known as the BNP. They have a hard on for Mein Kamp and a will to create a socialist Nationalist socialist type power to the people type nation, under their God, the Nazi party. Amen.

Give the power back to the whites, give the power back to the isolationist idiots that ruined Europe in the 20th century. It's not something you want to see happen again. It's not something you would think we didn't learn from. Happily we will never have to learn again, because we've seen the damage the far right can do, even if they are the new Nationalist B ocialist Workers Party. Or the fourth Reich dressed as lamb.

Yeah my life revolves around teaching racists to appreciate the fact that there's more than life to living in a bubble. I think to be honest we've got the meat of the BNP here, and the fact that some people haven't the slightest idea what they are talking about. Multiculturalism is evil, yeah we get it. Pity we don't get it enough to vote in anyone that backward and ignorant.

A plus is that we have much better forms of government who live in the real world, they may be ****, but they aint half as clueless as the alternative. It's like trying to teach communists to appreciate the right wing, or libertarians of either wing that there system is so bad that it would only work in Utopia. To sum up, the BNP are a magical fairy tale party, long on ideas but short on pragmatism.

majority of peadophiles = white, chav gangs = white

Prove it.

jails in cities like Glasgow = whites, football hooligans = white

Almost all jails will have a majourity white population, beacuse the majourity of the population is white. But the point is ethnics and immigrants are over represented, they 'contribute' less to your supposed 'society'.

So now we've estabilished that immigrants contribute less than natives (also whites on the whole), why possibly bring them here if you had the best interests of society in mind?
******* lol wefly, it doesn't take two minutes to think about this stuff and realise why it is so laughably wrong and illogical.

Also I challenge you to find a good source which backs up a claim to extra contibution from immigrants economically. gg.

Edit: I think this is the part where you and monkey ethier; leave the thread because you can't argue, resort to character assassination or devolve into crying infant type appeal to emotion, oh wait you've both already done that. gg.

Im not saying I like Scientology but I hate it when people say the religion is stupid because of outlandish beliefs.

We live in a country where we believe in mass telepathic communication on Sundays with a big thing in the sky. Where we think someone will rise from the dead a few thousand year after he died. Where your soul goes to a place where all the "good" people are and the "evil" people (the people who are less lucky in life and have to do non-socially accepted things for a living) will be sent to an underworld where they will be eternally tortured. In fact the person that sends them to this eternal torture is meant to be perfect and good.

(Oh and I know a fair bit about the CoS [that is, as much as i'm allowed to know (and a bit more) without having to pay for the privilege, and I'd definitely say it was a cult. A record of suspicious deaths and legally aggressive behaviour, a hierarchy of knowledge as well as rank, not strictly evangelistic [evangelism is more the motif of religions and sects], a concern for finances [to say the least], a debt to living or recently passed away figures [around whom mythologies are constructed], and a debt to contemporary ideals masqueraded as theology...

My dentist is a Scientologist. She tried to persuade me to go to one of their meetings once; her words were "a very handsome boy will wait for you and will show you around and hang out with you". This is how they find new members. With handsome boys and beautiful girls as a bate. It's disgusting.

The worst part is that I found a scientology book in my mother's house -the dentist had given it to her- and when I asked her about it she went crazy "I like their ideas and there is nothing wrong with that and don't judge what you don't know.... blah, blah, blah).

Not sure what the space-centre analogy has to do with things. I'm saying that the desire to control, manipulate and influence people and world affairs extends beyond scientology and into the vatican, amongst other places.

Modern day Christianity does not require monetary outlay to become a part of the religion. Bibles are often given away free, and are available cheaply throughout the world. Churches take an active part in the community, offering help to the less fortunate.

I'm no Christian, but claiming equivalence between Christianity and Scientology is absurd for far more reasons than the few I'm able to list.

To an extent this is true, although it varies between branches of Christianity - look at US evangelicals for example - and people throughout the world give money to church collections and the like.

But in terms of absurdity of beliefs, it's impossible to claim that Scientology is more absurd than Christianity.

Not when, as has been pointed out earlier in this thread, the beliefs of Scientology are sourced from a man who has been quoted as saying that creating a religion is the best way of making money. A man whose previous job was that of science fiction author, and who is recorded as being a habitual liar and conman.

The beliefs in themselves may not seem to make any more sense, but their sources are wildly different.

"The Cult Awareness Network received more complaints concerning Scientology than any other group. They therefore listed the Church of Scientology at the top of their cult list, until they went into bankruptcy from suits initiated by Scientology (1996). Ultimately, they were bought in Bankruptcy Court by the Church of Scientology (1997), which now operates the new Cult Awareness Network as a promotional arm of the church"

Do you prefer New York or London?

<post author="ak56" datetime="2010-02-21T13:55:00" id="p1">
This is very much subjective, but which city do you prefer? Both cities I guess are pretty comparable, both roughly the same sized, both of similar world notability and both very diverse.

However, I'd have to say I prefer New York, despite being the same sized, in my opinion New York has a much grander feel about it, modern and historic buildings work really well together, while in many parts of London arcetechture is really **** and imo distracts from the good aspects of London.

Also, on the two occasions I've been to New York, Manhattan feels significatly safer than Central London in terms of getting mugged, beaten up, etc. And even in the rougher parts of New York, if you keep yourself to yourself in the day you're fairly safe, which is more than I can say for some parts of London.

They don't have any historic buildings, everything is from the last 150 years and most of it from the last 80.

I've never been to New York so I can't really compare the two. London's okay, but I'm not really a fan of massive cities. I hate the constant crowds and business in central London; in Edinburgh if I go into town at the right time of day or the right point in the year (ie not tourist season), the number of people is just about bearable. London, in my experience, is always insanely crowded.

Never been to New York, and I envy my Human Geography colleagues for being able to go there next year (although we get to go to Almeria in Spain <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":cool:"/> ), but I doubt it compares to the imperial majesty of central London. London is a city where every street has a story, and every building a tale. New York's glitz and commercialism may be impressive, but dig deeper and the reasons for much of New York's construction are boring and mundane.

Manhattan's, maybe, due to police essentially fortifying that borough under orders from Giulani way back when. But take the five boroughs as a whole, or indeed the wider metropolitan area, and New York is one of the most criminally active places in the Western World.

London by a landslide... but I like New York too and it's quite likely I will end up living there.

New York is too garish and 'trying too hard' in places. London doesn't have to try hard to be fabulous... it just is. I prefer the old architecture and history of London to the modern bright lights of NYC.

I've never been to New York, but I think I would love it. However, I've been to London hundreds of times and I know I love it! There's so much history everywhere, and green parks, and things to see and do, different markets, brilliant shops and places to eat and drink... I've never been mugged or been a victim of crime there, either.

EDIT: I think a lot of people are saying New York because of the novelty of it - London doesn't seem as interesting because they've lived in Britain all their lives - 'familiarity breed contempt', if you will.

NYC has advantages:

Travel :
Its the same population on half the space so commuting is cut down significantly. You seem to spend half your life travelling <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/> in London.

Tubes run 24hrs, and express trains run much faster with fewer stops, and their tube are more reliable to boot (their map system is damn confusing <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/> though)

Nightlife:
Central London closes down far too early, ridiculously early for a hub city. Even with the new licensing laws it's a ghost town past 23:00. The crappy clubs outweigh the good ones in the centre. You have to travel east for a decent nightlife. Even then you struggle for a quiet spot-and you can forget about fresh food.

I easily found a quiet bar open at 2am where I could enjoy a conversation up till 5 am.

Food:
NYC has incredible quality cheap food. The Pizzas are cheap and out of this world! The Calzones were utterly indescribable and for that price. insane.

You can order good quality food, at that quiet late night bar you easily found opened. Piping hot, brought to your table, and thoroughly enjoyable and affordable.

A very nice club seated my friend and I where we enjoyed light sea food platters, before hitting the dance floor. The club was amazing, pricey but the same experience in the UK would have been beyond our means as students.

Attitude:
Strangers came up and talked to me in bars and clubs. People had a get up and go attitude and I made a lot of contacts useful contacts. NYC is the place to make things happen if your not from a privileged well connected background.

Fort Lauderdale,

Cape Cod,
Somewhere in New England I've forgotten the name of.

So yes, there is a lot that I've missed and OK So I was last in the US in
'01 and its probably entirely changed since then however.

By fake I meant (and are you asking the same of the person who actually used the word? They might have a different take on it compared to me) fake as in 'fake happiness', theres a lot of actual stuff which is fake such as the cheese but I'd pin it down much closer to just the fake happiness of the US.

I friend of mine went to Chicago and on a receipt it said 'Thank you for letting me serve you today'. Printed on each and every receipt was a note of thanks for servitude. I think that exemplifies it nicely.

You mention areas distracting from the good parts of London, which does suggest you haven't seen anything other than the good parts of Manhattan Island - the financial sector etc as well as the good surrounding areas. If you know someone from there, get them to take you on a real tour of New York. Not far from all the bright lights of the centre are areas that look like slums (and no, nothing you have seen in London comes close to how bad they are) and it's not very safe at all. Even hidden away in the centre are some pretty dreadful sights. That said some of the suburbs are very nice, but are mainly for the wealthy.

Overall London is my preference, everything good about New York London has just as good, and often better. It's also much safer - and the skyscrapers look ridiculous and don't make for a good city (well, I suppose when your very high up they cool which is handy if your rich and can afford a high up penthouse)

And London is not full of Americans, that should be enough to convince anyone.

Actually, the times I've visited because of budget I've stayed in hotels in rather working-class areas of Queens and Brooklyn. In these areas it has been evident that they are the sort of places where crime definately does exist under the surface, but I never felt unsafe in any of them, there certainly was not the apmosphere of tension and risk that does exist in many rough parts of London, even during the day.

In my experience, in 2010 the roughest parts of New York are no worse than the roughest parts of London, and as in New York there is a more defined destinction between good areas and bad areas, you are safer in New York than you are in London.

I think you have the mentality of a bye-gone era where New York was the big bad city and London was rather qaint and gentile. The reality is in the last 10 years the two cities have receachd a par in terms of crime, if not somewhat switched roles.

I would disagree, it was about a year and a half ago that I went and some of the areas were bad, very bad. I was talking to people from around there that some of some family friends know and was warned not to walk around the area at all if possible. Driving around that day I even saw a couple of people roaming around with guns on display (I admit this took me by surprise). Although some of these are small areas, nothing even close to this exists in London so it is not some "mentality".

But I think you do have a point that, as a tourist, your unlikely to see anything like this, and some people may feel safer there than London. The problem is that this is a concerted effort by the city to make it feel safe. It does not mean it is any more safe than London at all, it just feels that way. If London were to make even half that effort (and it would only need to be half the effort after the difference I saw) then it would feel just as safe to these people.

You also have a point about the areas being defined more, but I would rather be a city that happens to have a small criminal element around the place like any normal area would, than one that has a huge effort to keep safe areas but with huge almost no go areas existing. On the streets of London you may have more of a chance to get you pocket picked. On the streets of New York, get lost and you could be in serious trouble.

This may be true, however, there are a couple of reasons why the situation in New York is better than London. There is a lot more definition between good areas and bad areas in New York than there is in London. In London I've found a few times you can be walking in what seems like a nice area, and you've strayed slightly from the centre and found yourself in a gang infested ******** unexpectedly.

However, the really rough parts of New York where you have to exercise particularly caucion are quite far removed from Manhattan and its immediate surroundings, so as a tourist, it's pretty easy to avoid ********* in NY, while in London I can imagine tourists run into ********* quite frequently.

Also, the rough areas of New York ultimately pose less risk to an uninvolved stranger than the rough areas of London to.

I've lived 15 minutes from NYC for most of my life. I hate that city. The buildings are so tall they block out the sun, which bothers me. Plus there's too many people, the traffic is awful, and it's too loud. Also, I heard the metro in New York is awful, though I've never been on it before.

London is much nicer. The metro is easy to understand and it's more open, if that makes sense. The tall buildings in NY make it feel like you're in a maze.

London! New York was extremely close to where I grew up (town in New Jersey practically a suburb of NYC). New York drives me mad! The thought of going back to the states to live there makes me hyperventilate. It's just so hectic, too many cars and people not stopping for anything. And buildings that you have to crane your neck to see. The green areas are few and far between, and it is deceptively unwalkable. Also I'd rather tussle with the people in the underground than the crazies you can run into at the New York Metro anyday! There is also something disgustingly pretentious about the young "hip" places of New York like when they re-did St. Marks Place and the East Village. Usually when I have to go for an appointment I hide out in Bryant Park and refuse to move from that little patch of green until the time comes.

But I've also lived in quite diverse and busy areas of London, so idk what my problem is <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/confused.gif" alt=":confused:"/>

just noticed I havent answered the question in this thread, havent been to NY, but would love to, although I'm not sure if I could live with the American accent, personally find it annoying, no offence to anyone.

i have lived in both and found this to be the case as well. some of the soviet-esq London council estates (which are planned terribly and laid out like a maze) are in the middle of nice areas. they make the projects in NYC look nice in comparison. also, the contrast is less in NYC. in London you can literally cross a road and go from multi-million pound homes to near third world living conditions in 30 seconds.

This is a really tough question and one that I contemplate quite often. I've applied to university both in New York and London, which has prompted me to compare the two quite a deal. In the end, I would say New York is the most amazing city in the world, but London comes right after it. What I love about New York are the skyscrapers, the greed, the constant pace that is so hard to find in London. London is more quaint; it is charming and welcoming. Therefore London is where I'm headed now that I'm 18 and still quite naive. New York's too tough for me right now, I think. It'll be perfect after 3 years in London, though, and besides then I'll be 21 which is ideal for US immigrants. But yeah, I think I'll end up in New York because it's more inspiring. The most amazing sight I've ever seen is the New York skyline in the dark. It's freaking epic!!

There are many more wealthy young people in Manhatten then there are in Central London for sure. This is mostly due to the accesibility of housing (you can afford a small apartment in Manhatten on a graduate salary while in London this is very difficult).

Central London also has more geriatrics because it is calmer and easier to live in, while it is common for yuppies to live in Manhatten throughout their 20's/30's then move to connecticut or jersey to start a family.

And in terms of being successful...Manhatten offers more opportunities in pretty much every industry aside from perhaps finance and law where it is tied with London. i am amazed that anyone can afford to live (and have a decent quality of life) in London without earning 40,000+ GBP a year

**I've edited this one year later, after much personal growth, reflexion, more traveling, experiences, listening to different viewpoints, seeing things in a different way etc. In green underneath. I hope they help someone.

I'm not from London nor NYC. I've lived in London for 4 years and have lived in NYC for 3 months and hands down I prefer London ANYTIME. When I left for NYC from London I was so sure I hated London and couldn't wait to be out of there and was so sure I'd fall in love with NYC...boy was I wrong and the "you never know what you got til it's gone" saying never applied more.

Here's why:

1)Whoever said ppl in NYC are fake was RIGHT. People in London may not be as outgoing, may not walk up to you and talk to you randomly on the streets or be over friendly with you on outings but they are much more down to earth, much more genuine, FRIENDLIER and smile at you in a genuine way and long term relationships are easier!!! In NYC they walk up to you with too much friendliness too soon and then you never hear from them again...I also think NYC is very shallow in that people seem to just talk sex, money, clubbing all the time and nothing else.

I haven't had a single person smile at me during 3 months in NYC but when they do it is FAKE, very fake. The news people in NYC seem very fake. Everything feels very fake.

The cab drivers ARE SO DISRESPECTFUL. Never say hello or thank you.

Ok, one year later I've changed my mind on this. I've realized people in London are actually overly polite and it can be "fake", just to "say it" but not mean it. Americans are more straightforward and don't have to say "sorry, thank you" all the time, doesn't mean they're rude.

About the shallowness of the americans, I have to say americans are MUCH WARMER AND FRIENDLIER. They are more simple and "childlike". I am now prefering this to the Londonders who rationalize too much and lack emotions. Americans have more of a heart and are more generous, hands down.

2) TOO MUCH INDIVIDUALISM in NYC...and too much revolving around money and material things...NYC is much less social meaning people do not sit down and socialize like in London....in London you see people sitting in parcs, cafés etc and talking but in NYC they just sit there and loog good... When I was there all the talking revolves around the oscars, cheezy reality TV and money or how to make it as a star. Seriously...people seem to be so individualistic they lack a certain emotional sensitivity to others and lack interest in others.

I am now seeing this as a good thing. Londoners don't have enough individualism and tend to see everyone "the same", this is really dangerous when you're trying to be different or make something out of yourself, you feel very quickly discouraged. People in america have more faith and a more positive outlook. Granted they have that fake happiness and smile at times, but some of it is not all that fake, I've come to see they really are like that in many ways. They're just more positive. why is this bad? Is the norm being sad and depressed?People in London are just more depressed and seem so sad all the time.

3) Men are very aggressive and women too...the men in London are very polite and do not look at you straight in the eye with the intention to date you. Here in NYC I was aggressed every five minutes with american men asking my number...NO SHAME, they just walk up to you and very very aggressive and direct...they'll immediately start talking about intimacy in rude and lewd terms and if you refuse they insult you !!! The women look at you with JEALOUSY a lot on the streets if you are a pretty girl. Not nice. In London you can feel more girl power and the English girls and foreigner girls who live in London are WAY NICER than the girls in NYC.

I stand by the aggressive thing, HOWEVER I now see I was exxagerating, I think it's a good thing. Londoners don't know how to approach people. Bad thing.

4) NYC as a city is not that green, seems smaller than London...not as much culture or cultural things, everything and I mean absolutely everything revolves around money and celebrities...when you're done with Times Square, central Park, 5th avenue and the likes there's nothing else to see...then it's the same boring thing day in and day out...London is SO HUGE you need a lifetime to explore it all.

So what?

5) The people do not know how to dress, it's a fashion disaster...honestly...its as if everyone is homeless. Girls have less class than in London.

Actually I stand by that fashion is not that good BUT BUT BUT I now see this as a good thing, americans are more down to earth and don't always have to dress up, it's more casual and comfy HOWEVER PEOPLE DRESS BETTER on night outings and going to church and 100% better than those in London

6) SUBWAY IS GROSS AND DIRTY in NYC and so many homeless people in it....10 times more than London !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! London's tube 100% more clean. The people who take subway in NYC seem to be more of the young people with no money whereas thats not the case in London.

Again, the people in subways in america are nicer, there is lively chatting going on all the time, people look at you like a normal human being, if you like privacy a lot not a good thing. In London you do have lively chatting in the evenings when people go clubbing but generally speaking its DEAD and sad. You see people laughing, crying etc, it's more human and less reserved.

7) DIVERSITY sucks in NYC: It's always black, latinos, jews and whites and the rest doesn't count... Its like they know nothing else...sure you got a few chinese, italians and indians in NYC but that's about it and they are not in large numbers...in London ITS AMAZING to have australians, south africans, jews, french, german, indians, latin american people, eastern europeans, canadians asians, NIgerians, somalians, etc etc in LARGE numbers with their own communities, food stores, festivals... and not just 1 or 2...and they each have their own areas...

Ok granted its not their fault but I still hate this.

8) when you go to Times Square on the weekends at night 80% of what you see are young tennagy blacks mostly dressed in Hip Hop Gear...I've never understood why...I once went to the movies in Times Square which would be the equivalent of the Leicester Square Odeon cinema but there were only KIDS in jeans and all black or latinos...

I still stand by that. That was odd.Nothing against black and latinos teenagers but there was only that, so odd, where is the diversity in age and nationality, I was told new yorkers never go to times square but there were not even any tourists there...barely !!!

9) Not enough history in NYC

I see this as positive now, it means ppl are not so stuck in the past

10) Food is not that great to be honest, once you've tried the pizzas and philly cheese steak not much to explore

Well...LOL to that

11) People can be RUDE !!! no manners, THEY STARE AT YOU in the subway, streets....I find London to be BETTER as its more anonymous and people DO NOT STARE AT EACH OTHER

12) Emotionally speaking, I prefer London...people seem more sensitive, human and genuine. In NYC you get a much more "fake" feeling and you always feel like you need to perform and try to be something you're not (its all about money, becoming famous or the best at your job); PEOPLE DO NOT ENJOY LIFE AT ALL....

I don't think this anylonger...

ALL IN ALL....I'll just go to NYC to visit but I could never live there, London is better MUCH MUCH BETTER for genuine relationships, long lasting friendships and for culture and socializing.

I've never liked how everything revolved around money and "making it" in America....they are not laid back and seem to not have any identity apart from STATUS and ACHIEVEMENTS (I'm this and that or try to be this and that or have met such and such...in London ppl talk about their lives and their personalities more)

ANYWAY....be careful with NYC.

ALSO...in London people seem to understand people better, psychologically speaking. in NYC people can get VERY PARANOID and lack that emotional intelligence. They do not take any interest in other people's lives unless there is something in it for themselves...in London you talk to people JUST FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF IT...here in america and NYC...you will NEVER get anyone to just chat to you just for the enjoyment of the convo...it's always something behind their minds...

ALSO...the subway payment methods are ARCHAIC and so less advanced than London...no oyster cards and their cards all LOOK THE SAME...and the ticket doesnt tell you the date or for where it is for so it is very easy to get confused...BUT I loved the fact you don't need to "check out" when getting off the subway...you just leave and do not need to swipe your oyster in as you leave, you just leave and that's it.

8) when you go to Times Square on the weekends at night 80% of what you see are young tennagy blacks mostly dressed in Hip Hop Gear...I've never understood why...I once went to the movies in Times Square which would be the equivalent of the Leicester Square Odeon cinema but there were only KIDS in jeans and all black or latinos...

9) Not enough history in NYC

10) Food is not that great to be honest, once you've tried the pizzas and philly cheese steak not much to explore

11) People can be RUDE !!! no manners, THEY STARE AT YOU in the subway, streets....I find London to be BETTER as its more anonymous and people DO NOT STARE AT EACH OTHER

12) Emotionally speaking, I prefer London...people seem more sensitive, human and genuine. In NYC you get a much more "fake" feeling and you always feel like you need to perform and try to be something you're not (its all about money, becoming famous or the best at your job); PEOPLE DO NOT ENJOY LIFE AT ALL....

ALL IN ALL....I'll just go to NYC to visit but I could never live there, London is better MUCH MUCH BETTER for genuine relationships, long lasting friendships and for culture and socializing.

I've never liked how everything revolved around money and "making it" in America....they are not laid back and seem to not have any identity apart from STATUS and ACHIEVEMENTS (I'm this and that or try to be this and that or have met such and such...in London ppl talk about their lives and their personalities more)

ANYWAY....be careful with NYC.

I agree that Brits and Europeans in general are more laid back, but in an American's eye that is just laziness.

And you have to remember that people in London may appear more social simply because there is more of a pub culture and people drink much more heavily in the UK.

And with regards to NYC in general, the areas you listed (5'th ave, time square, etc) are dire in my opinion. I am American and much prefer London's touristy areas than NYC's, but to say that Leicester square is nicer or classier is taking it a bit too far <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> NYC in the 20's and below is much nicer and more residential, mid-town is a nightmare at the best of times and I certainly would not want to live there!

And yes, people in NYC are much more career focused and demanding than they are in London, but this is the American attitude and has nothing to do with the city. I have met plenty of people in London who earn 20-30k, live in zone 2 or 3 and are perfectly content in their position. Personally, I find I achieve more when I am surrounded by people who also want to better themselves (whatever that means). I would rather work longer hours, earn more money, and live in zone 1.

People are also more attached to labels in NYC, so your career and education background will pigeonhole you into something that everyone has already established in their minds.

I would also like to know who you were conversing with on a daily basis to only hear conversation about reality television!

And the whole thing about diversity is just crap. America has a much higher black and latino population than Europe does so of course you are going to see more of them. Also, NYC is in a country with 300+ million people while London is in a country with just 60 million. Naturally there are going to be more nationalities in London as you have foreign countries a car drive away, while America only has Canada and Mexico.

This is true but no where near the extent you do in london. The planning in London is notoriously bad but that was due mainly to the blitz

London is much muuuch older than New York. London was a long established city when NY was discovered by Europeans. Native Americans sold the island of Manhattan to European settlers for $24. Nowadays that land is some of the most expensive on earth. London is low-lying and has alotta history, but NY is the center of the universe nowadays.

NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEW YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORK. But then I have been to New York, I have never actually been to London, apart from Heathrow but that doesn't count. If it does, the answer is still the same :P

I haven't been to New York many times and have been to London for my work, so both of them do jingle some good memories in my mind. If asked about a place that I have a good experience then it surely has to be London. The atmosphere, the buses, the cabs, the trains and most importantly the people and the office where I used to work, I just miss them all.

Historic Buildings in New York? Do like New York but its not the 'Clean' city its made out to be, worth a visit but London is much more interesting to me.

I much prefer New York to London, to be honest. Because:

1) The weather in New York is much more consistent. You actually have seasons lol. You have relatively reliable summers, unlike in London.

2) New Yorkers are more fun and friendly. Londoners are too introverted. Though, having said that, Londoners are more polite. But, of course, politeness does not equal friendliness.

3) New York, or at least much of Manhattan, seems to me to be a more accepting/liberal place than London.

4) There is a vibe/buzz/excitement in New York that you simply do not get in London.

5) The way New York has been designed is so much better than London. You can't get lost in New York. London, on the other hand, is a maze.

Actually, the times I've visited because of budget I've stayed in hotels in rather working-class areas of Queens and Brooklyn. In these areas it has been evident that they are the sort of places where crime definately does exist under the surface, but I never felt unsafe in any of them, there certainly was not the apmosphere of tension and risk that does exist in many rough parts of London, even during the day.

In my experience, in 2010 the roughest parts of New York are no worse than the roughest parts of London, and as in New York there is a more defined destinction between good areas and bad areas, you are safer in New York than you are in London.

I think you have the mentality of a bye-gone era where New York was the big bad city and London was rather qaint and gentile. The reality is in the last 10 years the two cities have receachd a par in terms of crime, if not somewhat switched roles.

I know this is an old post, but not for nothing, there is no way the worst neighborhoods in London are as bad as the worst neighborhoods in New York. I've walked through Brixton at 2 AM on the weekends multiple times and never felt remotely unsafe. The worst thing I saw were people posted up with their pitbull on a leash. I'm sure things happen all the time there, but it wasn't so bad that I couldn't walk through.

In New York, this just isn't the case. You simply cannot walk through neighborhoods like Brownsville, Bed Stuy, East New York, South Jamaica, Queensbridge, Far Rockaway, and most parts of the Bronx at night and pretty much anytime of the day as well. Remember, there are a lot of guns in America and especially in the inner city. Drugs and gangs are a far bigger problem in America than in conservative England. The police in England don't even carry guns and there are far less on the street per capita in London versus NYC. in 2010 there were 135 murders in London. In NYC, there were 532 - you can google this. Other violent crime such as robbery and assault is also far more likely to occur in NYC and at a much higher rate than in London. NYC is just a much wilder place than London because of the Darwinian, Capitalist culture of America and the fact that there is such a high concentration of poverty in a much more overpopulated, dense city. In America, the dollar is king, and everyone is ultra competitive. Everyone is trying to get rich and the poor are killing each other just to survive. Greed is central to crime, and it's just more prevalent on every level in America in general and more so in NYC. Also, most blue collar neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn that have hotels, like LIC, Astoria near the airport etc are actually very safe areas. You can't compare that to walking through the projects at midnight.

NYC is bigger than life, and much of the stuff you see portrayed in movies, actually occurs in the city. London is much more conservative, steeped in tradition and a lot slower paced - in London you don't have 8 lanes of traffic flowing through towering skyscrapers, and sidewalks flooding with people. Don't get me wrong, London is an incredible, world class city, but it just doesn't have the high paced energy, action, and buzz of NYC. The only other developed city that can match NYC in this respect is Tokyo.

I currently live in NYC and used to live in South Kensington. I personally prefer London, it's so vibrant and the architecture is spectacular. It also has such a great energy year round that you really start to miss after leaving.

NYC is great but the sheer grandiosity of it makes it feel fake and much less sincere.

I changed my mind about many things I wrote earlier. I've had one additional year to grow and see things differently, what a difference does a year make. It's based on more traveling, personal growth, studying, observations, learning, meeting new people, listening to different viewpoints, getting older, experiencing things, seeing more clearly and more objectively etc. I'll share under my previous statements about NYC/London in a different color. I know I'm so passionate about this, bear with me, I'm French ! <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.png"/>

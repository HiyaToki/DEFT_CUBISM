<TEXT>
<P>
Bulgaria and Italy agreed to expand bilateral ties and cooperation during a one-
day visit by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to Sofia on Thursday,
according to local reports on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi was the first foreign prime minister to visit Bulgaria since the new
government was elected in July 2009. He had meetings with his Bulgarian
counterpart Boiko Borisov and Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi said Italy was one of Bulgaria's top three trade partners. "Thousands
of Italian companies now give jobs to tens of thousands of Bulgarians but we can
enhance these contacts further and expand cooperation with small and medium-
sized companies so that they could have greater presence in Bulgaria."
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi also offered his firm support to Bulgaria in its bid to get an
additional 445.87 million U.S. dollars compensation from the EU for the closure
of Units 3 and 4 of the Nuclear Power Plant Kozloduy. The units were shut down
as part of an agreement during Bulgaria's EU accession negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Italy would also urge Brussels to speed up payment of 10.4 billion U.S. dollars
for Bulgarian infrastructure, said Berlusconi.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria and Italy established diplomatic relations in 1879 and the cooperation
between both countries has been fruitful during the past 15 years. Turnover last
year topped 4.46 billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
The Austrian government welcomes the signing of two protocols between Turkey and
Armenia on the normalization of bilateral relations, Foreign Minister Michael
Spindelegger said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed by the foreign ministers of Turkey and Armenia in Zurich
University on Saturday evening "is a milestone on the road to the normalization
of their relationship," Spindelegger said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that both sides could continue this process of convergence to overcome
the remaining differences and set steps to ensure the positive effects of this
agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
The protocols cover two main aspects: the opening of borders and the
establishment of diplomatic relations between Turkey and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
The protocols need to be ratified by the two countries' parliaments before they
can take effect.
</P>
<P>
Armenia and Turkey have had no diplomatic or economic ties since Armenia
declared its independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991. The two
neighbors have long been at odds over the World War I massacres of Armenians
under Ottoman rule.

HAVANA, Oct. 9 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cuban government has hailed China's development over the past 60 years as an
example and hope for the third world.
</P>
<P>
"China is an example... No other country has lifted so many people out of
poverty. This is something of which the Chinese people and government should be
proud, and which the rest of the world admires," official daily Granma said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Granma, the Communist Party of Cuba newspaper, recalled the speech of former
Cuban leader Fidel Castro that China was a promising hope for Third World
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The West cannot disavow the reality," Granma said.
</P>
<P>
The daily referred to the book "China's Path: the Scientific Outlook on
Development" by Chinese Professor Tian Yingkui, who said China had entered a
period of accelerated development in industrialization, urbanization,
informatics, marketing and internationalization.
</P>
<P>
During its economic and social development, China continued to emancipate and
develop more productive forces, and improve those aspects that do not fit the
development of the productive forces, Granma quoted Tian as saying in the book.

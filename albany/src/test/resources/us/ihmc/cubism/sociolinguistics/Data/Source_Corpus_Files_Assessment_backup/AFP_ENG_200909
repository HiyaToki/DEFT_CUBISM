<P>
Israel on Tuesday welcomed the election of Bulgaria's Irina Bokova as head of
the UN culture agency after she defeated an Egyptian rival accused of anti-
Semitism.
</P>
<P>
"Israel welcomes the election and is convinced that fruitful cooperation with
UNESCO will continue and even be reinforced," the foreign ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Bokova, a former foreign minister, was elected director general of the UN
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation after five rounds of voting by
its executive council that eliminated her main rival Faruq Hosni.
</P>
<P>
Hosni, Egypt's culture minister, was dogged by anti-Semitism accusations after
saying last year that he would burn Israeli books.
</P>
<P>
Despite the controversy, Israel had earlier this year lifted its opposition to
his candidacy after a meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

<TEXT>
<P>
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Monday his country backed the bid by Rio
de Janeiro to host the 2016 Olympics against competition from Chicago, Madrid
and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"France supports Rio's candidacy for 2016. All our votes are yours, and we hope
it happens," he told a joint news conference with Brazilian President Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva in Brasilia, where he was attending Brazil's Independence
Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"It would be great for Brazil and Latin America," said Sarkozy.
</P>
<P>
Sarkozy then joked to his counterpart: "And in the event that it won't compete
with Brazil's ski resorts, we hope we'll get your support for Annecy for the
2018 Winter Games."
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) will announce the winning city on
October 2, in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
Lula, who has helped Rio surge to be frontrunner alongside Chicago, is to
attend.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with AFP last week, the Brazilian leader said he had made a deal
with Spain's King Juan Carlos for mutual support in the IOC's voting rounds.
</P>
<P>
"We made a deal: if Brazil isn't in the second round, it can support Spain; but
if Spain isn't in, it votes for Brazil. It's an honest game," he said.

Oil firm slams UN expert in Ivory Coast pollution row
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, Sept 16, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An oil trading company condemned a United Nations report Thursday suggesting
"strong" evidence linking toxic waste from one of its ships to at least 15
deaths in the Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
London-based Trafigura said the report by Okechukwu Ibeanu, UN Special
Rapporteur looking into the 2006 tragedy in the west African country, threatens
to prejudice legal action in Britain and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"We are appalled at the basic lack of balance and analytical rigour reflected in
the report," which reaches "premature, inaccurate and potentially damaging
conclusions that are entirely unsupported by verifiable evidence," it said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Referring to ongoing legal action, it added: "Both Trafigura and its lawyers
previously requested Professor Ibeanu to exercise great caution in this respect,
and it is deeply regrettable that he has overlooked these concerns."
</P>
<P>
Victims took legal action in Britain after waste from the Probo Koala ship was
dumped around the chief city Abidjan in August 2006, leaving 69 people in
hospital as well as those who died.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 people sought medical help for problems including vomiting,
diarrhoea and breathing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In his report presented in Geneva on Thursday, the UN rapporteur concluded:
"There seems to be strong prima facie evidence that the reported deaths and
adverse health consequences are related to the dumping of the waste."
</P>
<P>
But Trafigura insisted it was not responsible for deaths or serious injuries
from the dumping, which was carried out by a subcontractor.
</P>
<P>
"For the avoidance of doubt, Trafigura has always maintained that the dumped
slops could never have caused the deaths and serious illnesses which have been
alleged," it added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday a joint statement by Trafigura and lawyers representing victims
said a "global settlement is being considered" and that compensation was
"likely" to be approved by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement the company will pay thousands of people who suffered
short-term illnesses. The compensation will run to millions of pounds (dollars),
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Court proceedings are ongoing in the Netherlands, with hearings scheduled for
2010.
</P>
<P>
Trafigura reached a 152 million euro (215 million dollar) settlement with the
Ivorian government in February 2007 and was given indemnity against prosecution.

Airbus parent company slams Boeing 'subsidies'
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PARIS, Sept 8, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of Airbus parent EADS on Tuesday criticised what he called "an opaque
system" of subsidies for Boeing as the bitter rivalry between the two aerospace
giants reaches fever pitch.
</P>
<P>
"For Boeing, there's an opaque system of all sorts of subsidies," Louis Gallois,
head of the European Aeronautic Defence and Space company, said in an interview
with French financial daily La Tribune.
</P>
<P>
Gallois said subsidies for US rival Boeing were coming from "NASA, the Pentagon,
the US states where they have factories" as well as in the form of advances from
Japan and state aid for Italy's Alenia, a Boeing subcontractor.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organisation (WTO) last week issued its first ruling on the
acrimonious dispute over subsidies between Boeing and Airbus.
</P>
<P>
The ruling is confidential and some analysts said a clear-cut judgment was
unlikely given the complexity of the case.

Pakistan PM condemns US missile strikes
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ISLAMABAD, Sept 16, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani Wednesday said that US missile
strikes on tribal areas targeting Taliban militants infringed on his country's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad consistently publicly opposes the missile strikes, saying they also
deepen resentment among the populace.
</P>
<P>
Since August 2008, nearly 60 such strikes -- carried out by unmanned US drone
aircraft -- have killed more than 550 people.
</P>
<P>
"As far as drone attacks are concerned Pakistan condemns them and it considers
it an infringement into our sovereignty," Gilani told reporters at a dinner he
hosted at his official residence.
</P>
<P>
"We have talked to them (US) and asked them to review it and change the policy
or transfer the technology to us, or there should be an alternative thing which
should be controlled by us," Gilani said.
</P>
<P>
"We live in this country and we know who is a terrorist and who is not a
terrorist."
</P>
<P>
Condemnation by Gilani comes despite an August 5 drone attack that killed
Baitullah Mehsud, the head of Pakistan's Taliban organisation and suspected Al-
Qaeda facilitator.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts also believe the government tacitly supports the attacks, a charge
Islamabad denies.
</P>
<P>
Washington says Islamist fighters are hiding in the Pakistani mountains and
tribal areas near the Afghan border, plotting attacks on Western targets and
crossing the porous frontier to attack foreign troops in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Taliban and Al-Qaeda rebels are believed to have fled Afghanistan after the 2001
US-led invasion, carving out boltholes and training camps in the remote
mountains.
</P>
<P>
The US military does not as a rule comment on drone attacks, but its armed
forces and the Central Intelligence Agency operating in neighbouring Afghanistan
are the only forces that deploy pilotless drones in the region.

Rights Watch reports surge in Myanmar political prisoners
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of political prisoners in military-ruled Myanmar has doubled to more
than 2,200 in the two years since a crackdown on protests, Human Rights Watch
said in a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said activists, Buddhist monks, journalists and artists had all been
detained and "sentenced to draconian prison terms after unfair trials" for
involvement in the 2007 protests and helping people after the devastating
Cyclone Nargis in 2008.
</P>
<P>
HRW said that more than 100 people have been detained in recent months in
Myanmar, which is also known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
"Burma's generals are planning elections next year that will be a sham if
their opponents are in prison," said Tom Malinowski, an HRW official. "Despite
recent conciliatory visits by UN and foreign officials, the military government
is actually increasing the number of critics it is throwing into its squalid
prisons."
</P>
<P>
Rights Watch said the "brutality" of the military government had been
highlighted by the 18-month detention term ordered against Nobel Peace prize
winner Aung San Suu Kyi in August after an American intruder broke into her
house.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi "is not the only person facing persecution for her political
beliefs. People like the comedian Zargana, imprisoned for criticizing the
government's pathetic response to Cyclone Nargis, or Su Su Nway, a brave woman
activist who led street protests, also deserve the world's attention." said
the HRW report.
</P>
<P>
Zargana was detained after talking to the international media about problems
helping people after Cyclone Nargis.
</P>
<P>
The junta has promised elections in 2010 but has still not passed a law setting
out the participation of political parties.
</P>
<P>
HRW called on the United States, China, India, Russia, Japan and the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations to put pressure on Myanmar to obtain the release of
political prisoners.

Gay, human rights activists attacked with impunity in Serbia: Amnesty
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
belgrade, Sept 14, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The authorities in Serbia have failed to protect human rights and gay activists,
Amnesty International said Monday ahead of the first gay pride march in Belgrade
for nine years.
</P>
<P>
"The Serbian authorities are obliged to protect the rights of all people to
peaceful assembly and freedom of expression," it said.
</P>
<P>
"They must condemn publicly all attacks on and threats to human rights activists
and provide protection and support during the forthcoming Belgrade Pride," the
group said.
</P>
<P>
The parade scheduled for September 20 is the first since the rally in 2001 that
had ended in violence after police failed to prevent football fans, nationalists
and skinheads from attacking participants.
</P>
<P>
The gay community "is marginalised even within civil society and criminal
investigations into assaults on gay people, even where the perpetrators have
been identified, are rarely resolved," Sian Jones, Amnesty International's
Balkans expert, said in a statement published on the agency's website.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Belgrade Pride have warned of "serious threats by right-wing
and religious organisations," the Amnesty said.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that "women's rights campaigners have been portrayed in the media
as anti-Serb for favouring the independence of Kosovo, and for demanding
accountability for war crimes committed in the 1990s" Balkans conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Physical attacks and threats to the lives and property of human rights
activists are seldom promptly and impartially investigated by the authorities
and few perpetrators are brought to justice," Jonas said.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International called on the Serbian government "to implement in law and
in practice the principles of the UN Declaration of Human Rights Defenders,
which provides a framework for the protection and support of human rights
defenders."
</P>
<P>
"The lack of political will on the part of the authorities to fulfil their
obligations to guarantee human rights defenders their right to freedom of
expression and assembly creates a climate of impunity which stifles civil
society," it said.
</P>
<P>
In March, Serbia's parliament passed an anti-discrimination bill strongly
opposed by nationalists and the religious community.
</P>
<P>
The legislation triggered a heated public debate at the time over an article
banning sexual discrimination in the mainly Christian Orthodox country.

MR. OCTOBER II
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times Sports Columnist
</P>
<P>
For more than 30 years, he has watched as the game's greatest
players have taken their best shot at him.  Hall of Famers and
sluggers. Steroid freaks and All-Stars. From Willie Stargell to
Barry Bonds, and from Mike Schmidt to Mark McGwire. Every year has
been another opportunity for some upstart with a Louisville Slugger
to challenge the standard of the Fall set by Reggie Jackson.  And
when the moment finally arrived, when Chase Utley finally tied Mr.
October's record of five home runs in a single World Series,
Jackson was sitting in the quiet of the Yankees clubhouse consoling
someone else.  "I was talking to A.J. (Burnett) after he had come
out of the game," Jackson said late Tuesday afternoon, standing
outside the Yankees clubhouse on the off day before Game 6. "We
were talking about his disappointment, and how everything he
</P>
<P>
wanted hadn't happened the way he expected.
</P>
<P>
"So that's where I was when I look up and  oh by the way  Utley
just hit his fifth home run. How about that?"
</P>
<P>
Yes, how about that?
</P>
<P>
One incredible record now shared by two disparate men. It's as
if Utley came along to find Reggie in some parallel universe. For
when it comes to Reggie Jackson, no spotlight is too bright and no
conversation too long. As for Chase Utley, publicity is a headache
and talking is overrated.
</P>
<P>
Jackson once referred to himself as the straw that stirs the
drink in New York. Utley recalls his father saying it was
unnecessary to tell the world how good you are because, if you
really were, others would say it for you.
</P>
<P>
On the night he swung at three consecutive pitches and hit three
consecutive home runs against the Dodgers in Game 6 of the 1977
World Series, Jackson was sharing drinks with then-New York Gov.
Hugh Carey at a Manhattan bar until 5 o'clock the next morning.
</P>
<P>
Utley wasn't around Yankee Stadium on Tuesday to share his
postgame itinerary after hitting two homers in Game 5 Monday night
in Philadelphia, but it's probably safe to assume Pennsylvania Gov.
Ed Rendell and a corner bar stool were not involved.
</P>
<P>
In a way, this disparity is part of the game's beauty. That
generations can be linked and memories merged in ways never
expected.
</P>
<P>
Chase Utley is a terrific hitter. One of the absolute best of
his era. But when it comes to tying the greatest home run record of
the postseason, he was probably not the odds-on favorite. Not once
did he hit five home runs in a five-game span this season.
</P>
<P>
McGwire could have done it. He hit home runs at a more ferocious
pace than any player in history. But he had one homer in his three
World Series appearances. Schmidt could have done it. He led the
league eight times. But he had two homers in a pair of World Series
appearances.
</P>
<P>
"Bonds could have done it," Jackson said. "Bonds would have
broke that record if they had pitched to him in '02."
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was the Yankees who chose to pitch to Utley. And,
presumably, are now regretting it. In Philadelphia's two victories
in the World Series, Utley has four home runs and six RBIs.
</P>
<P>
"I don't even like to talk about him because he doesn't want me
to," Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said after Game 5. "But he
is one of the most prepared, one of the most dedicated, and he has
the most desire and passion to play the game that I've ever been
around.
</P>
<P>
"I used to say Kirby Puckett was my favorite player. All those
things I just said? I used to say it about Kirby Puckett. The only
thing Kirby might have on Chase was he was more flamboyant because
he smiled a lot. Chase is a little bit different. He's quiet and he
goes about his business in a real good way."
</P>
<P>
Of course, Utley still has time to do more damage in this
Series. Jackson had six games to hit his five homers in '77. Utley
reached five by the end of Game 5 and will get another shot tonight
in Game 6, possibly in a Game 7.
</P>
<P>
If the thought unnerves Jackson, he's not showing it. Now a
special adviser with the Yankees, he was relaxed and chatty around
the batting cage during Tuesday's workout and seemed more concern
about the plight of the team than his legacy.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of the record. Absolutely. And if he hits seven,
I'll still be proud of the five I hit," Jackson said. "I got
three in Game 6 and we won the World Series, and that's a memory I
will always have. Now, I will say I don't want him to hit any more
homers because if he does we may lose. But if he hits six or seven,
and we still win the World Series, then I'm good to go."
</P>
<P>
Before he walks away, I mention to Jackson that he does share
some similarities with Utley. Both were left-handed hitters and
neither has a typical slugger's body. Jackson looks barely 5 feet
9. Utley is listed at 170 pounds.
</P>
<P>
"You know the answer? He's a great player," Jackson said.
"Forget the size. I always said, be small but play big."
</P>
<P>
When it came to home runs in the World Series, there was never
anyone as big as Reggie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
Until Chase Utley came along.

HIGH-TECH FIRMS IN HIGH DEMAND IN BAY STATE  WHO ' S NEXT?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Silicon Valley giants have been shopping for acquisitions in
Massachusetts, buying and partnering with key companies from this
state's
much-vaunted technology industry. As businesses long known for
their local
roots join with or are absorbed by ventures from California, the
question
becomes: What signature companies are left, and are they targets
for
takeovers?
</P>
<P>
In October, the world's top networking firm, Cisco Systems Inc.
of San
Jose, Calif., agreed to pay $2.9 billion to buy Starent Networks
Corp. of
Tewksbury, a maker of data equipment for cellphone systems. Earlier
this
month, Cisco announced a joint venture with Hopkinton's EMC Corp.,
the top
maker of high-end data storage gear. And this week, the huge
computer
company Hewlett-Packard Co. said it would buy Cisco competitor 3Com
Corp.
of Marlborough for $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
A common thread runs through all three deals: Giant companies
looking for
new avenues of business are finding it easier to buy companies than
to
build their own. So are there other Massachusetts tech companies
that could
be prime acquisition targets?
</P>
<P>
They all are, according to Richard deNey, head of mergers and
acquisitions
at Needham &amp; Co. in New York. "Technology, as a sector in the
economy, is
consolidating," deNey said. "There's really not a tech company up
there
((in Boston)) that couldn't benefit from consolidation."
</P>
<P>
Steve O'Leary, chairman of the industry group Massachusetts
Technology
Leadership Council, agrees that the state remains a target-rich
environment. "I think all of them are companies people might want
to
buy," O'Leary said. "The harder question is to determine who's
next."
</P>
<P>
Possible acquisitions range from venture-backed startups to
industry
giants. Takeover rumors about EMC, for instance, have been wafting
around
for years. That's possible, O'Leary said, but unlikely given EMC's
market
capitalization of more than $34 billion.
</P>
<P>
"The number of companies that would be able to acquire EMC
would be in the
single digits," he said. Besides, O'Leary doubts that anyone at
EMC is
interested. "EMC is a company that has a very strong go-it-alone
culture." A buyer would have to offer a large premium over EMC's
stock
price to persuade the board to give up its independence, he added.
An EMC
spokesman said the company does not comment on rumor or
speculation.
</P>
<P>
O'Leary said iRobot Corp., the Bedford maker of military and
consumer
robots, is another desirable-but-unlikely acquisition target.
"It's a
wonderful company," said O'Leary, but the best acquistions are
"pure
play" companies that focus on serving a single, clearly defined
market.
</P>
<P>
A company such as Sony Corp. might value iRobot's Roomba home
vacuum
cleaner business, while a defense contractor such as Northrup
Grumman Corp.
could fancy iRobot's PackBot military surveillance machines. But
O'Leary
said that no potential acquirer would want both. IRobot said it
could not
make an executive available to comment.
</P>
<P>
Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. in
Wayland,
thinks Internet technology company Akamai Technologies Inc. of
Cambridge is
a good candidate for a buyout.
</P>
<P>
"It seems obviously that it might be a fit for Microsoft, or
possibly a
Microsoft competitor such as Google," Kay said.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Akamai stock rose last month on speculation that Google
would
pursue a takeover bid. But yesterday, during a visit to India,
Akamai's
chief scientist Tom Leighton threw cold water on the reports.
</P>
<P>
"There have been rumours since the very first time we went
public that
somebody's trying to buy Akamai," Leighton said, "but we are very
happy
and very successful as an independent company."
</P>
<P>
A much more plausible target is Boston's Carbonite Inc., a
venture-financed
company that has become a leading provider of online data backup
for home
computers. "Carbonite's got terrific growth and seems to be doing
very
well," O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
He said it might make a good pickup for network security
companies that
target consumers, such as Symantec Corp. or McAfee Inc. O'Leary
also cited
Hewlett-Packard, which could preinstall Carbonite on its line of
home
computers.
</P>
<P>
But Carbonite cofounder David Friend says he's not interested.
</P>
<P>
"We've been approached a number of times," he said, "but I
really would
like to take this company public."
</P>
<P>
Friend predicted that as many as 100 million people worldwide
will start
backing up their computers online in the next few years. If
Carbonite can
get just 10 percent of that business, that would mean annual
revenue of
over $500 million. Friend said a company that size could rake in up
to $4
billion in a public stock offering, far more than Carbonite would
attract
in an acquisition, and that's the more attractive strategy.

SCIENTOLOGY-ANNIE-STP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caught between Scientology and her husband, Annie Tidman chose
the church
</P>
<P>
The subject of this story, Annie Tidman, denied through her
attorney that the following events happened. The attorney would not
make Tidman available to be interviewed. This account comes from
interviews with her ex-husband and four former Church of
Scientology staff members.
</P>
<P>
The morning of Nov. 17, 1992, Annie Logan left the Church of
Scientology's California base without permission.
</P>
<P>
She took a cab to nearby Ontario International Airport. Her
husband, Jim Logan, had prepaid for a ticket to Boston, but the
airline couldn't find her name on the passenger list. She called
Logan at his parent's house in Nova Scotia, nervous, figuring
church staffers were likely in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
"She was definitely anxious because every moment that is lost,
they have time to catch up," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jim and Annie had a plan: She would fly to Boston, change planes
and fly to Portland, Maine, where he would be waiting. They would
drive to Nova Scotia and start a new life and family together. They
would remain Scientologists, but no longer as members of the
church's work force, the Sea Org.
</P>
<P>
He told her the name he used in buying the ticket, and she
called back a few minutes later, more relaxed. She had made it
through security. "You better be at the airport," she told him.
</P>
<P>
Jim Logan drove through a snowstorm that night to be at the gate
in Portland. But his wife never arrived. They have not spoken
since.
</P>
<P>
Marty Rathbun got the word during his morning workout at the
Scientology base in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
Annie Logan was gone.
</P>
<P>
"This was a five-alarm fire," the former church official
recalled. "I knew this was a crying catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
Starting as a young teenager and all through her 20s, Annie
Tidman was a trusted aide to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.
She was one of his four original "messengers." She ran errands,
summoned staff and carried his correspondence.
</P>
<P>
She married Pat Broeker and the couple became close aides to
Hubbard in his final years. She was with the founder to the end,
one of a handful who could expand on Scientology's closely scripted
narrative surrounding his 1986 death, his finances and his
intentions regarding the church's future leadership.
</P>
<P>
With Hubbard's blessing, Annie Broeker became a top Scientology
executive. But she was edged aside by David Miscavige, an intense
young officer who grabbed the reins of the church after the founder
died.
</P>
<P>
This is the story of how she left and came back, and another
example of the church controlling staff who might reveal
Scientology's inner workings.
</P>
<P>
The morning she took off, Scientology's security team quickly
found her flight information and Rathbun was on his way.
</P>
<P>
A longtime top lieutenant of Miscavige, Rathbun often went after
Sea Org members who left or "blew," especially high-profile ones.
</P>
<P>
"I literally just grabbed the wallet, a cell phone, threw them
in my pockets, jumped in the car, and told my secretary, 'Get me on
the soonest flight to Boston' ... And I just started heading down
the road 100 miles an hour toward Ontario."
</P>
<P>
Rathbun's mission: intercept Annie Logan before she reached her
husband and bring her back to the Sea Org. He said his plane landed
in Boston about 20 minutes behind hers.
</P>
<P>
Rathbun said he hurried to where her connecting flight to
Portland was about to board, went down some stairs and came within
shouting distance of the passengers as they walked toward the
plane.
</P>
<P>
"Annie!"
</P>
<P>
She swung around.
</P>
<P>
"And literally when she saw me, she kind of was startled and
her shoulders just drooped," Rathbun said. "She was defeated. I
didn't even have an argument with her. I didn't have to go to
persuasion. She was just so shocked."
</P>
<P>
She went back to the terminal with Rathbun, who said he played
on her loyalty to Hubbard. He told her that running away could
damage the church's chance of gaining tax-exempt status, which was
close at hand after a 40-year battle with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
Enemies would be at her door wanting inside information on
Hubbard, his estate and church finances, Rathbun warned.
</P>
<P>
She agreed to come back to California, Rathbun said. He said he
called Miscavige to tell him they would be on the first plane back
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
But Rathbun said Miscavige already had arranged for them to be
flown back that night on one of John Travolta's planes, to make
sure Annie Logan did not have another chance to run.
</P>
<P>
She was back in the fold.
</P>
<P>
Travolta's publicist referred all questions regarding
Scientology to the church, which described this account as
"utterly ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
AN 'OUTRAGEOUS INTRUSION'
</P>
<P>
She is 53 now, and goes by her maiden name, Annie Tidman.
</P>
<P>
Her lawyer, Richelle Kemler, declined to make her available for
an interview. She said the St. Petersburg Times is relying on
biased, ill-informed and discredited sources.
</P>
<P>
"All of the statements attributed to her and all of the actions
involving her that were described in (the Times' questions) are
false," Kemler wrote.
</P>
<P>
In another letter, Kemler described the story as "an outrageous
intrusion into her privacy."
</P>
<P>
Church spokesman Tommy Davis decried this story and previous
Times coverage as "tabloid journalism."
</P>
<P>
"Your newest low is your recent obsession with Annie Tidman,
who has been a close and dear friend of Mr. Miscavige for over 30
years. You have already proven you do not let mere facts get in the
way of the story you want to create, but the hypocrisy and sheer
illogic of your latest invention is astounding."
</P>
<P>
Davis criticized the Times' "blind reliance" on Jim Logan, who
he said was dismissed from the Sea Org and from Scientology "for
conduct inconsistent with the tenets of the religion."
</P>
<P>
THE BOOT, THEN A PLAN
</P>
<P>
Pat Broeker left the church, and he and Annie divorced. On June
22, 1990, she remarried.
</P>
<P>
Her new husband, Jim Logan, didn't hesitate to speak his mind
when he saw what he believed were departures from Hubbard policy.
He wrote reports critical of Miscavige and other executives.
</P>
<P>
"He used to take a stand," former base security chief Gary
Morehead said of Logan. "If he had an opinion, he'd let his voice
be heard. ... Certain things he just wouldn't let go of."
</P>
<P>
The hierarchy responded in July 1992 with a "non enturbulation
order" intended to stop Logan from causing disturbances or
agitating colleagues.
</P>
<P>
In early October, they determined Logan violated the order, and
he was declared a "suppressive person," an SP, someone who deals
only in bad news, can't get things done, won't own up to his
crimes, is destructive to others and must be separated from the
group.
</P>
<P>
Morehead was among the staff who escorted Logan to the Old
Gilman House, an isolated corner of the 500-acre base reserved for
SPs and other troubled staffers. He said they acted on orders from
Miscavige.
</P>
<P>
A few days later, the process began to kick him out of the Sea
Org. Logan said he was allowed to see his wife. "She said, 'They
can't make me divorce you,' " Logan recalled.
</P>
<P>
He said they spoke cryptically as they mapped their future. He
would try to rehabilitate himself with Scientology and she would
begin the formal process of leaving the Sea Org. In six months or
so they could reunite and start over together in Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 8, 1992, Logan's last day in the Sea Org, he said church
executives showed the couple a Hubbard policy indicating she should
"disconnect" from him. Logan said they were being told to
divorce.
</P>
<P>
That same day, according to court records, Annie Logan filed for
divorce in Riverside County, Calif. At 8:30 that night, a church
executive served Jim Logan with the papers. He was driven to a bus
station in Los Angeles and given a ticket to Bangor, Maine.
</P>
<P>
In the five weeks that followed, he said he and his wife spoke
secretly about a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
Initially, he said, they discussed her plan to follow procedure
to leave the Sea Org, but she became impatient to start a new life.
"We wanted to have babies; we wanted to have a family," he said.
</P>
<P>
They talked about voiding the divorce action they had started in
the presence of Scientology officials at the base. Logan said he
told her she would have to initiate the dismissal because she was
the petitioner.
</P>
<P>
DEAR JIM . . .
</P>
<P>
When his wife didn't show in Portland, Jim Logan said he called
the Boston airport and was told her flight from California had been
delayed in Denver and that there was another delay in Boston for
her connecting flight. Maybe she would be on the morning flight to
Portland.
</P>
<P>
He waited until morning. No Annie.
</P>
<P>
"It just came crashing down on me. I thought, 'Oh my God. She
went back.' I didn't know what happened."
</P>
<P>
He flew to Boston to find out more. The airlines could tell him
only that she got off there but didn't get on for Portland.
</P>
<P>
He called security at the Scientology base in Southern
California and was told she was there. She had returned to the Sea
Org.
</P>
<P>
"This was incredibly devastating," Logan said.
</P>
<P>
A few days later, he said, an envelope arrived in Nova Scotia
that contained a letter addressed to the Riverside County court,
signed "Annie Logan."
</P>
<P>
"My marriage has reconciled and this proceeding is not needed
and I wish to terminate the divorce request," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It said she had moved to Nova Scotia and asked the court to send
to her new address papers that would allow her to rescind the
divorce.
</P>
<P>
Jim Logan said it was apparent to him that she mailed the letter
before she left for Boston and meant for him to send it along to
Riverside officials. She included an envelope addressed to his home
in Nova Scotia and two quarters to cover the postage.
</P>
<P>
Years later, Jim Logan views the letter as clear evidence of his
wife's intent to join him, a plan that Rathbun managed to short
circuit.
</P>
<P>
That Christmas, Logan sent his wife flowers. She wrote him back
in February:
</P>
<P>
"Dear Jim, I wanted to personally let you know that after much
consideration, I have decided to remain in the Sea Org simply
because my goals and purposes in life are the same as this group's
and can only really be accomplished by this group."
</P>
<P>
She signed it with a standard Scientology salutation: "ML (much
love), Annie."
</P>
<P>
He said they've not communicated in the 17 years since.
</P>
<P>
HAPPY VALLEY
</P>
<P>
When Annie Logan returned to California, Rathbun said Miscavige
directed that she be sent to live in a house on a remote ranch
called "Happy Valley," a 20-minute drive from the international
base.
</P>
<P>
Rathbun said Miscavige sometimes gave him updates on her stay
there.
</P>
<P>
Rathbun, Morehead and another former Sea Org member say she
lived there for about two years, during which her divorce became
final and she went back to her maiden name, Annie Tidman.
</P>
<P>
A fourth former staffer, Jim Mortland, said he remembers her
being there about a year. Mortland, who headed the "estates"
division, which oversaw maintenance and construction at Scientology
properties in the area, said "it was no secret" Tidman was at
Happy Valley.
</P>
<P>
Morehead, the security chief at the base for most of the 1990s,
said he prepared the house for Tidman to live in and part of his
daily routine was driving a Scientology "auditor" there to
conduct daily counseling sessions.
</P>
<P>
Security staff kept track of Tidman, Morehead said, one inside
the house, another outside. "They had to be within arm's reach of
her at all times," he said. "If she took off, all hell would
break loose."
</P>
<P>
Morehead said the staff understood that if Tidman was to try to
leave, there would be no physical restraint. They simply would have
walked with her until help arrived to persuade her to stay.
</P>
<P>
In any case, the nearest town, Hemet, was three hours away by
foot and the house was surrounded by dense wilderness.
</P>
<P>
Amy Scobee said she worked alongside Tidman in the late 1990s
and again around 2000. In the church's cinema department, they
often worked late into the night, Scobee said. "We would talk and
drink coffee and laugh our a---- off."
</P>
<P>
Scobee said Tidman talked a lot about her time at Happy Valley.
She said Tidman initially regretted coming back and forsaking Logan
-- "She was in love with him." -- and balked at being at Happy
Valley. "It took her a long time to change her mind."
</P>
<P>
Scobee said Tidman reread Hubbard's books and, over time,
decided to keep working in the Sea Org. She said Tidman told her
she had decided to never marry again.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, she felt like she was a changed person," Scobee
said.
</P>
<P>
Davis, the church spokesman, did not address specific questions
about the accounts of Jim Logan, Rathbun, Morehead and the others.
He said the lack of response should not be interpreted "as an
admission of any truth whatsoever to these insane stories."
</P>
<P>
Kemler, Tidman's lawyer, wrote that Tidman "has never been held
under guard or otherwise held against her will by the church at any
time."
</P>
<P>
She stated Tidman is adamant she did not see or speak with
Morehead at the time and did not make the statements attributed to
her by Scobee.
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 26, 1993, Annie and Jim Logan were officially divorced.

      -----------

      SCIENTOLOGY'S RESPONSE:
</P>
<P>
The Times sent the Church of Scientology written questions about
Annie Tidman and twice requested an interview. Those requests were
denied. "All of the statements attributed to her and all of the
actions involving her that were described in your October 19 letter
are false," wrote attorney Richelle L. Kemler. In a second letter,
Kemler said the Times' story was "an extraordinary intrusion into
(Annie Tidman's) privacy." Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis said
in a three-page letter that Tidman and church leader David
Miscavige were friends of 30 years and denounced the Times for
writing a story. Davis also:
</P>
<P>
.. accused the newspaper of reaching its "newest low" in
tabloid journalism and has accepted "as gospel statements from
anyone who speaks ill of Scientology."
</P>
<P>
.. said the newspaper was relying on the word of ex-husband Jim
Logan, who was dismissed "from the Sea Org and from church
membership for conduct inconsistent with the tenets of the
religion." Davis asked why Logan stayed silent 17 years and only
now is telling "his tale of woe?"
</P>
<P>
.. accused the newspaper of a double standard in featuring
Logan's words but giving far less prominence to the words of the
ex-wives of church defectors Marty Rathbun, Mike Rinder and Tom De
Vocht. "The unifying principle here is all too clear: the only
information from ex-spouses that is relevant is data that advances
your story line."
</P>
<P>
.. said it defies common sense that an adult woman stayed in the
Sea Org 17 years if she did not want to be there.
</P>
<P>
.. said not to assume "that an absence of response to each and
every one of your utterly ridiculous allegations serves as an
admission of any truth whatsoever to these insane stories."
</P>
<P>
.. said the Times has ignored the church's "unprecedented
expansion," including the opening of new facilities in Rome and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
WHAT JIM LOGAN SAYS NOW:
</P>
<P>
.. "I have never said anything negative about Scientology. Ever.
I am a Scientologist. I study the subject daily. It's changed my
life." He said church staff called him this month to update his
contact information and wanted to sell him books known as "the
basics."
</P>
<P>
.. He did not engage in "conduct inconsistent with the tenets of
the religion" and was unjustly removed.
</P>
<P>
.. He decided to talk publicly after 17 years when it became
apparent last year that the church was not going to restore him to
good standing, in violation of Hubbard policy. He said he completed
the necessary steps but the church was unresponsive. "That's why I
am speaking now."
</P>

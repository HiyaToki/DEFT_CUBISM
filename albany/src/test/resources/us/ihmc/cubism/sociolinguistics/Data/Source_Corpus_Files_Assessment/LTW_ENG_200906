Tensions Precede Merkel Visit to U.S.
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Obama may be the most popular politician in Germany. But that
hasn't won him any favors from the German government.
</P>
<P>
Since he moved into the White House, Obama has encountered a string of
rebukes and lectures from Chancellor Angela Merkel and German lawmakers, who
have irritated Washington by refusing to provide more help in fighting the
Afghan war or closing the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
among other disputes. The diplomatic tensions stand in contrast to the
rapturous greeting candidate Obama received in Berlin last July, when an
estimated 200,000 people jammed the streets.
</P>
<P>
The sorest point has been over how to respond to the economic crisis,
with Merkel and some of her ministers warning darkly that U.S. fiscal and
monetary policies have been reckless and will trigger a global wave of
inflation. In turn, Obama's advisers have complained that Germany -- the
world's leading exporter and Europe's largest economy -- has done the least
of any industrialized nation to fight the recession.
</P>
<P>
Merkel will meet with Obama in Washington for the first time Friday --
three months after she turned down a previous invitation to visit, according
to German reports. The White House said the leaders will discuss "a broad
agenda of global issues of mutual concern."
</P>
<P>
Although opinion polls show that Obama remains a huge favorite with the
German public, lawmakers have been slower to warm to him, said Werner Hoyer,
parliamentary leader on foreign policy issues for the Free Democrats, a
minority party with close ties to Washington.
</P>
<P>
"The Obama phenomenon has been underestimated here for a very long time.
Most people in the media and in Parliament all predicted he'd lose to
Hillary," Hoyer said, referring to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton. Some in Merkel's party, the Christian Democratic Union, "still
can't believe Bush is out. They bet on the neoconservatives for so long that
they don't know how to react," he added.
</P>
<P>
Merkel built a close relationship with Bush and was credited with
improving ties between Berlin and Washington after her election in 2005. Her
predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, was persona non grata in the Bush White
House for his vocal opposition to the war in Iraq and his chumminess with
Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
It has taken longer for Merkel and Obama to develop a rapport, analysts
said, even though both are known for their analytical personalities and come
from academic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
Obama has made two trips to Germany to sit down with Merkel and has
been invited back in November for the 20th anniversary of the collapse of
the Berlin Wall. During Obama's visit to Dresden on June 5, both leaders
played down reports of a transatlantic rift, even as Merkel's aides sniped
anonymously in the news media about the difficulties of scheduling the trip
with the White House.
</P>
<P>
"The truth of the matter is, is that the relationship not only between
our two countries but our two governments is outstanding," Obama said at a
news conference in Dresden. Added Merkel: "It's fun to work together with
the American president."
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said it was unrealistic to expect the countries to agree
on everything after Obama's election. Each has its own national interests,
said Josef Joffe, editor of the newspaper Die Zeit.
</P>
<P>
"Has there ever been an American president since the harshest days of
the Cold War who has gotten the Germans to follow his lead?" Joffe, a
prominent German commentator, said in a phone interview. "It doesn't matter
who is in the White House and who is in the chancellery in Berlin. Interests
beat friendships every time."
</P>
<P>
Merkel has a reputation as a colorless politician who eschews sound
bites and goes out of her way not to antagonize anyone. But she has aimed
several well-scripted zingers at Washington in recent months, expressing
displeasure with U.S. economic policy.
</P>
<P>
On June 2, in a speech in Berlin, Merkel ripped the U.S. Federal
Reserve for its loose monetary policy, saying she viewed it with "a great
deal of skepticism." The comments broke with a long-standing tradition among
German politicians not to criticize the independence of central
banks.
</P>
<P>
A week earlier, Merkel criticized the U.S. Treasury as being unhelpful
during negotiations over the fate of Opel, a European division of General
Motors that employs 25,000 Germans. "There is room for improvement on the
American side," she told the magazine Der Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
More significantly, Merkel and other German leaders have assigned
virtually all blame for the global recession to Wall Street and Washington,
arguing that U.S. regulators were not only asleep at the switch but also had
ignored German warnings that banks and equity funds were running out of
control. Less has been said about problems of equal magnitude with German
banks, which have more toxic assets on their books than their American
counterparts, according to the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Risse, a political science professor at the Free University of
Berlin, said the German political calendar was playing a role and predicted
things would smooth out after national elections in September.
</P>
<P>
"She's in a tough election campaign," he said of Merkel. "I don't sense
any ill feelings or something like that. But again, the transatlantic
relationship is not conflict free, and never has been."
</P>
<P>
Some of the U.S.-German conflicts date to the Bush years, such as the
running dispute over whether Berlin is doing enough to aid the NATO-led
military operation in Afghanistan. Germany has 3,500 troops in the NATO
coalition. But they are restricted from combat and confined to relatively
peaceful northern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the German government agreed to send four AWACS surveillance
planes and 300 more military personnel to Afghanistan, but only until
December. U.S. and NATO officials say they have largely given up
expectations that Germany will contribute anything else to the war effort,
which is highly unpopular among voters.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
The Obama administration had higher hopes that Germany would help it
resettle inmates from Guantanamo, especially since Merkel has called for the
closure of the prison for years. But her government has rejected two
requests from the State Department to give asylum to about a dozen
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Sueddeutsche Zeitung, a leading German newspaper, said Merkel risks
doing lasting damage to U.S.-German relations if she does not change her
mind about accepting Guantanamo prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"Next week she will appear at the White House -- and then, at the
latest, she must profess how much her (and the German) friendship is really
worth," the paper said in an editorial Wednesday.

Deeply Polarized Iran Heads to the Polls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A long column of provincial, working-class Iranians, clad in black and
walking on flip-flops, streamed into a highway underpass, heading for a
reelection rally for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
</P>
<P>
Standing on a high ledge safely out of the way, a group of cosmopolitan
youths looked down at the crowd of mostly out-of-towners. "Go back to the
zoo!" shouted a teenager with gelled-up hair and a green T-shirt, a sign of
support for Ahmadinejad's main challenger, Mir Hossein Mousavi.
</P>
<P>
"Sissies!" the marchers yelled back.
</P>
<P>
As Iranians go to the polls Friday to choose a president, the country is
more deeply polarized than at any time since the Islamic revolution that
overthrew the shah 30 years ago. After a bitter campaign that included
personal attacks on some of Iran's leading families, both sides are
preparing to contest the results, and many Iranians wonder whether the
social and economic rifts exposed by the election will deepen.
</P>
<P>
"Some people think that only they are Iran," said Saeed Majidi, who had
driven for hours on his 125cc motorcycle to hear Ahmadinejad speak at
Tehran's Grand Mosque. "But those with jobs and money only represent 30
percent of the population."
</P>
<P>
"We are Iran," Majidi concluded, pointing at the crowd pouring into the
tunnel, a sea of women with sunburned faces and bearded men with black
horn-rimmed glasses. "Other presidents never cared for us. Ahmadinejad
does."
</P>
<P>
Though he holds many of the levers of power, Ahmadinejad is proud of
his status as an outsider. He says the country's political class has drifted
away from its religious and revolutionary roots. Since his surprise election
in 2005, he has constantly attacked Iran's post-revolutionary elites,
contending that they long ago gave up fighting for the "barefooted" masses
and began doing business deals from their villas on the slopes of affluent
North Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad has turned the Iranian economy upside down, making sure that
advantages flow to the lower class. His government has increased state wages
and pensions and has made health insurance free for 22 million people. He
derides economists who blame him for high inflation and unemployment, saying
that they are tied to the higher classes and that his goal is to "spread
justice."
</P>
<P>
But his support does not come solely from the downtrodden. He is also
backed by a small group of hard-line Islamic clerics and leaders of Iran's
Revolutionary Guard Corps who share his resentment toward the West, his
calls for Iran to occupy its rightful place as a world power and his
championing of Iran's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
His leading challenger is Mousavi, an urbane, soft-spoken architect who
was prime minister from 1981 to 1989. Though out of power for two decades,
Mousavi is in many ways the Iranian establishment's candidate. He represents
an older generation of Islamic clergy and politicians who fought side by
side with the leader of the 1979 revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
but whose power and positions have gradually been stripped away by
Ahmadinejad and his associates.
</P>
<P>
Mousavi's political foot soldiers, in turn, are disgruntled middle-class
youths, intellectuals, artists and academics who have been alienated by the
current government's radical rhetoric and pervasive restrictions on personal
freedom, such as police controls on the way people dress, the banning of
books and the disciplining of dissident students.
</P>
<P>
Yet Ahmadinejad's main foil in the campaign has not been Mousavi.
Rather, he has tried to turn the election into a referendum on the man whom
he defeated in 2005 and who is not, formally, in the race this time: Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former Iranian president and head of one of the
country's most prominent families. In an apparently calculated move during a
June 3 nationally televised debate with Mousavi, Ahmadinejad attacked
Rafsanjani and his wealthy children, calling them "corrupt" and alleging
that Mousavi was their puppet.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani responded with an open letter asking Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to intervene against Ahmadinejad's personal attacks.
But Rafsanjani's son, Mehdi, seemed to confirm at least part of
Ahmadinejad's claim, telling foreign reporters that the family had helped
organize Mousavi's campaign and was planning to bring down Ahmadinejad.
</P>
<P>
The result is a confrontation not just between Iran's haves and
have-nots, but between the old revolutionaries who seized power from the
shah and a new cadre of radicals seeking to dislodge them.
</P>
<P>
"Our mistake has been that we have not dealt with the power seekers,"
said Mehdi Kalhor, Ahmadinejad's media adviser, using a label that
Ahmadinejad's supporters often attach to those around Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
"They are like a bacteria in every empire. The Islamic revolution was a
fight against these 1,000 ruling families," Kalhor added. "We now need to
carry out the objectives of the revolution."
</P>
<P>
Each camp has warned that the other may be planning to seize power by
nondemocratic means. Mousavi and another presidential challenger, Mehdi
Karroubi, have jointly created a committee against vote-rigging and
announced plans to post observers at all of Iran's approximately 45,000
polling places.
</P>
<P>
"We will have our results before the Ministry of Interior does,"
predicted Morteza Alviri, Karroubi's representative on the committee.
</P>
<P>
Aides to Ahmadinejad, meanwhile, say Mousavi's backers plan to claim
victory before the votes are fully counted and to mount a "color revolution"
like the Rose Revolution that swept away the post-Soviet government of
Georgia and the Orange Revolution in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"According to their plan, these people will make a heavy media
atmosphere, claiming premature victory with rallies to mobilize their
supporters," Gen. Yadollah Javani, head of the political office of the
Revolutionary Guard Corps, predicted in an interview with the guards'
magazine, Sobh-e Sadegh.

<P>
The United States supports a "united Georgia," US Vice President Joe Biden said
Thursday during a visit to the ex-Soviet state that lost territory after a war
with Russia last year.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Georgian parliament, Biden said that he wanted to deliver
"one simple, straightforward message: we seek a free, secure, democratic, united
Georgia."
</P>
<P>
Following the Russia-Georgia war last August, Moscow recognised two rebel
regions of Georgia -- Abkhazia and South Ossetia -- as independent states,
prompting condemnation from around the world.
</P>
<P>
Only remote Nicaragua followed Russia's lead in recognising the two regions as
independent, while the US and virtually all Western countries have insisted that
Georgia's territorial integrity must be respected.
</P>
<P>
US President Barack Obama has continued to back Georgian sovereignty over the
two regions while also seeking to improve US-Russian relations.

<P>
Veteran US journalists and family members bid farewell Thursday to Walter
Cronkite at a memorial service for the renowned CBS television anchor in New
York.
</P>
<P>
CBS said the service took place at Saint Bartholomew's Church in Manhattan ahead
of Cronkite's burial in the southern state of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending were news anchors and journalists Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather,
Barbara Walters, Brian Williams and Andy Rooney.
</P>
<P>
Cronkite died July 17, aged 92.
</P>
<P>
Presenter of the CBS Evening News program from 1962-1981, he became known as
"the most trusted man in America" for his calm and honest delivery during a
tumultuous time in US history.
</P>
<P>
Events during that period included civil rights unrest, the assassination of
president John F. Kennedy, the Vietnam war, the Moon landing, the Cold War, and
the Watergate scandal that toppled president Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
It was also a period when broadcast networks ruled supreme in the United States,
making Cronkite a truly national figure.
</P>
<P>
Sanford Socolow, a longtime CBS News executive, was quoted by CBS saying at the
memorial service: "He had this reputation for being cool and calm and collected
no matter what the circumstances, but that doesn't do him justice.
</P>
<P>
"He was really ferocious at times. He was always a wire service reporter in his
heart. And he always lived by the wire service adage 'Get it first, but get it
right.'"
</P>
<P>
His son, Chip Cronkite, remembered his father's gentle side, "saying to mom as
you passed her in the kitchen or the hall, 'Shall we dance?' and then taking her
for a few turns around the room."

<TEXT>
<P>
US President Barack Obama on Friday firmly condemned bombings in Jakarta that
killed at least nine people and injured dozens more, including eight Americans.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly condemn the attacks that occurred this morning in Jakarta, and
extend my deepest condolences to all of the victims and their loved ones," Obama
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The US government stands ready to help the Indonesian government respond to and
recover from these outrageous attacks as a friend and partner."
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesperson Robert Wood said eight of the estimated 40 injured
in the blasts were US citizens.
</P>
<P>
Obama, who spent part of his childhood in Indonesia, praised the country's
steadfastness "in combating violent extremism."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to partner with Indonesia to eliminate the threat from these
violent extremists, and we will be unwavering in supporting a future of security
and opportunity for the Indonesian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said her department was working
"to help American citizens injured in the blasts."
</P>
<P>
"The attacks reflect the viciousness of violent extremists, and remind us that
the threat of terrorism remains very real," Clinton said, offering her
sympathies to the victims and the Indonesian people.
</P>
<P>
"We have no higher priority than confronting this threat along with other
countries that share our commitment to a more peaceful and prosperous future."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
France's Sebastien Bourdais has been sacked  by the Toro Rosso team with
immediate effect, the Formula One outfit announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman fell out of favour following lacklustre performances in this
year's Formula One campaign and will not race for the team at the Hungarian
Grand Prix on July 26.
</P>
<P>
"Last weekend's German Grand Prix was Sebastien Bourdais' last race for
Scuderia Toro Rosso," said team principal Franz Tost.
</P>
<P>
"In Sebastien's second year with us, the partnership has not met our
expectations and therefore we have decided to replace him as from the next round
of the World Championship, the Hungarian Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
"An announcement about his replacement will be made shortly before the Hungarian
Grand Prix."
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old - winner of the now defunct Champ Car title in the United States
- is currently sixteenth in the driver's table, two rungs lower than Swiss team-
mate Sebastien Buemi. He joined Toro Rosso in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Jaime Alguersuari being tipped to take over from France's only Formula
One driver. Alguersuari, 19, who benefits from sponsorship by Spanish oil giant
Repsol, won last year's F3 championship.

Spain condemns Jakarta bombings

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spain condemned Friday's bombings at two hotels in Jakarta that killed at least
nine people and injured dozens, saying the attack showed the need to step up the
fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Spain expresses its firm condemnation of the terrorist
attacks which were carried out today in Jakarta," the foreign ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The loss of human life and the enormous damage caused should serve to reaffirm
the conviction that it is necessary to fight against terrorism with all our
energy and greater determination."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's government reiterates its
availability to cooperate with Indonesia "to put an end to the threat to peace
and coexistence which any form of terrorism represents", the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Two suspected suicide bombers set off the blasts which tore through the Ritz-
Carlton and nearby JW Marriott hotels and injured more than 40 people in the
Indonesian capital.
</P>
<P>
Spain has faced attacks by the armed Basque separatist group ETA and Islamic
militants in recent years. ETA is blamed for over 820 deaths in its 40-year
campaign of bombings and shootings for an independent Basque homeland.
</P>
<P>
In March 2004, Islamic militants angered over Spain's role in the US-led war in
Iraq set off bombs in three commuter trains in Madrid, killing 191 people.

France slams US executions

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
France condemned Wednesday the United States' use of the death penalty in the
wake of its latest execution, calling on Washington to impose a moratorium on
such punishments.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the US state of Ohio put to death 36-year-old Marvallous Keene, a
former gang leader who was sentenced to death after being convicted for five
murders committed in 1992 when he was aged 19.
</P>
<P>
Keene's lawyers had argued that he was mentally disturbed.
</P>
<P>
"France along with the European Union recalls its opposition to the death
penalty in all circumstances," said French foreign ministry spokesman Frederic
Desagneaux, branding executions "cruel and inhumane".
</P>
<P>
Desangeaux said that all judicial systems make mistakes, and argued that there
was no evidence that the death penalty deters crime.
</P>
<P>
France, the home of the guillotine, abolished the death penalty in 1981, four
years after carrying out its last decapitation.

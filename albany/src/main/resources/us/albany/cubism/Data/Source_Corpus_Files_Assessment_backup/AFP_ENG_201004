Actress Winslet speaks out against foie gras in video

LONDON, April 14, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet threw her weight Wednesday behind a campaign
against foie gras, narrating a video which she said shows the "terrifying and
painful" way the food is produced.
</P>
<P>
Winslet, winner of the 2009 best actress Academy Award for "The Reader", put her
voice to the footage for campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals (PETA).
</P>
<P>
The video -- which PETA said was filmed undercover on foie gras farms -- shows
birds confined to cramped cages and apparently being force-fed by having tubes
placed down their throats.
</P>
<P>
The foodstuff is normally made by force-feeding ducks and geese to enlarge their
livers.
</P>
<P>
"Foie gras is sold as an expensive 'delicacy' in some restaurants and shops, but
no one pays a higher price for foie gras than the ducks and geese who are abused
and killed to make it," she said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a terrifying and painful process for the birds, who have no semblance
of a normal life and know that several times a day a tube will be rammed down
their throats," added the 34-year-old.
</P>
<P>
She ended the video with an appeal to boycott the food: "Please join us in
helping ducks and geese by pledging never to eat foie gras."
</P>
<P>
PETA said the video would be sent to exclusive department stores around the
world in a bid to stop them selling the product.
</P>
<P>
Winslet is the latest British star to speak out against foie gras. Actor and
former 007 Roger Moore paid for and starred in a poster campaign outside a top
London shop in November against the food.
</P>
<P>
The bus stop poster outside the upmarket department store Selfridges, on the
British capital's Oxford Street, urged shoppers to think twice about buying the
delicacy. The ad was also for PETA.

<TEXT>
<P>
The US Senate expressed its "deepest sympathies" and "solidarity" with the
Polish people Wednesday after a fiery plane crash killed president Lech
Kaczynski and 95 other top officials.
</P>
<P>
Senators unanimously approved a measure to that effect and observed a minute of
silence in memory of Kaczynski and other victims, including senior Polish
politicians and military leaders, who died Saturday in the western Russian city
of Smolensk as they flew to a World War II memorial ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Senate "expresses its deepest sympathies to the people of Poland and the
families of those who perished for their profound loss," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
It also "expresses strong and continued solidarity with the people of Poland and
Polish-American communities in the United States."
</P>
<P>
A similar measure was due to go before the House of Representatives later
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
US President Barack Obama, his Russian counterpart Dimtry Medvedev and other
world leaders are to travel from far and wide to pay last respects to Kaczynski
and his wife Maria at a funeral on Sunday in the southern Polish city of Krakow.

Videogame titan Ubisoft going green

san francisco, April 19, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French videogame titan Ubisoft is intent on being a big player in greening the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Ubisoft announced on Monday that it is doing away with paper manuals
traditionally included with videogames crafted for play on Microsoft Xbox 360 or
Sony PlayStation 3 consoles.
</P>
<P>
The firm behind the blockbuster "Assassin's Creed" and "Tom Clancy" franchises
expects this fiscal year it will spare more than 2,300 trees by eliminating six
million paper manuals in videogame packages.
</P>
<P>
"Ubisoft is often recognized for making great games, but it's a special
privilege to be the industry leader at saving trees," said North American
president of Ubisoft Laurent Detoc.
</P>
<P>
"Introducing in-game digital manuals is just the latest example of Ubisoft's
ongoing commitment to being a more environmentally conscious company."
</P>
<P>
In a move made possible with nods from Microsoft and Sony, digitized manuals
will be included on disks that hold game software, according to Ubisoft vice
president of operations Rich Kubiszewski.
</P>
<P>
Ubisoft in March switched to in-game manuals for titles crafted for play on
personal computers in North America.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking steps to become an industry leader in environmentally conscious
packaging," Kubiszewski said.
</P>
<P>
"This obviously has impacts to the environment and the consumer, both positive.
No more losing the manual, and we can provide more robust content."
</P>
<P>
A skateboarding videogame made in collaboration with Olympic snowboard gold
medal winner Shaun White will be Ubisoft's first console title with a digitized
manual.
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty cool that Ubisoft is making a conscious effort to go green with
its new video game packaging," White said. "I'm excited for my new
skateboarding game to come out and stoked that it will be the very first Ubisoft
game to be part of their green packaging initiatives."
</P>
<P>
Ubisoft is also shifting to using only recycled plastic for cases holding titles
made for play on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The first game shipped in Eco-Tech packaging will be a version of "Tom Clancy's
Splinter Cell Conviction" being released later this month.
</P>
<P>
Ubisoft said it is in talks with Nintendo to use recycled plastic packaging for
titles made for play on the Japanese videogame titan's DS devices.
</P>
<P>
Earth-friendly practices in Ubisoft's San Francisco offices include providing
workers with mugs as part of a ban on paper cups and using utensils and plates
made from corn for easy composting.
</P>
<P>
"Ubisoft is definitely an environmentally conscious and innovative company, it
is in our top line objectives," Kubiszewski said.
</P>
<P>
Shunning paper manuals and shifting to recycled, or even biodegradable,
packaging are worthy objectives that need sign-on from publishers and retailers
to spread, said videogame analyst Billy Pidgeon of Game Changer Research.
</P>
<P>
"People in the tech industry are aware of environmental problems but due to the
nature of the business, especially hardware, intentions can be at cross-purposes
with business plans," Pidgeon said.
</P>
<P>
"Being green and less wasteful is all good but can go to hell when you are
trying to get the cheapest materials and production processes to get the lowest
prices for customers."

Iran wants 'atomic criminal' US suspended from IAEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TEHRAN, April 17, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iran slammed "atomic criminal" the United States on Saturday and called for its
suspension from the UN nuclear body, urging changes at the UN Security Council
and in the Non-proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in an opening message to a two-
day nuclear disarmament conference hosted by Tehran, said the use of nuclear
weapons was "haram", meaning religiously prohibited, and branded Washington as
the world's "only atomic criminal."
</P>
<P>
Hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad went a step further and called for
Washington's suspension from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) along
with all other nations who possess nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
"Only the US government has commited an atomic crime," said a message read out
from the all-powerful Khamenei, who formulates Tehran's foreign policy,
including its nuclear strategy.
</P>
<P>
"The world's only atomic criminal lies and presents itself as being against
nuclear weapons proliferation, while it has not taken any serious measures in
this regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad, under whose presidency Iran has aggressively pushed ahead with its
controversial nuclear programme despite three sets of UN sanctions, attacked the
present structure of the UN Security Council, the IAEA and even the NPT.
</P>
<P>
"An independent international group which plans and oversees nuclear disarmament
and prevents proliferation should be set up," he said as he opened the
conference attended by several foreign ministers and UN officials.
</P>
<P>
He said those who "possess, have used or threatened to use nuclear weapons be
suspended from the IAEA and its board of governors, especially the US which has
used a weapon made of atomic waste in the Iraq war."
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad did not elaborate on that charge but his remark is expected to irk
allies Russia and China. Both are nuclear states and have veto powers in the UN
Security Council, but have so far hesitated to back a fourth set of sanction
against Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad said "the right to veto, which is undemocratic, inhumane and unfair,
should either be annulled or if some insist on having this right, then some
countries from Latin America, Asia, Africa and Europe should also have the right
to veto in order to reduce its negative outcomes."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei and Ahmadinejad have been particularly infuriated in recent days with
Washington over its new nuclear policy unveiled last week.
</P>
<P>
The policy limits the countries against which Washington might use its nuclear
arsenal, but singles out Iran and North Korea as exceptions for flouting UN
Security Council regulations over their nuclear programmes.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadinejad even called for the review of the NPT of which Iran is a member and
so considers its right to enrich uranium, the most controversial aspect of its
nuclear programme.
</P>
<P>
"The review of the NPT must be done by independent countries who do not possess
nuclear arms," he said, adding that "the presence of those possessing weapons
especially US prevents the drawing up of a fair treaty."
</P>
<P>
Iranian atomic chief Ali Akbar Salehi said on Friday that the Tehran meeting
will serve as preparation for the next NPT review in New York early next month,
which Iran's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki plans to attend.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran conference comes just days after Washington ended its high-profile
nuclear summit which Iran criticised on the grounds that the United States holds
one of the world's largest stocks of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Obama pressed China and other UN Security Council skeptics to
back a fourth set of sanctions against Iran for its controversial uranium
enrichment programme that Western states say masks a drive for atomic arms.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, the Central African Republic, Oman,
Turkmenistan, Armenia and Swaziland are participating in the Tehran conference,
while Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are represented by their deputy
foreign ministers, an offical said.
</P>
<P>
A special aide of the Chinese foreign minister, representatives of the United
Nations and IAEA and the chief of Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) will
also be present, he said.

Danny Glover arrested at demo against France's Sodexo
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Gaithersburg, Maryland, April 16, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US actor Danny Glover and 11 others were arrested Friday at a protest outside
the US headquarters of French company Sodexo, which workers accuse of union-
bashing and poor working conditions.
</P>
<P>
Glover was taken away in handcuffs along with the outgoing head of the Service
Employees International Union (SEIU) Andy Stern, former Sodexo canteen cashier
Terry Shelley and several others, after crossing a police line outside the US
offices of the food services firm.
</P>
<P>
The action brought together hourly-paid workers, students, and even union
representatives from Britain and France who sought to show support for US
workers like Shelley, who said she was fired after becoming active in a trade
union.
</P>
<P>
"We're here today to say no more to deplorable pay and working conditions,"
Glover told the crowd of around 300 as they shouted "No Justice, No Pizza", a
reference to cafeteria workers who claim they are underpaid and receive few
benefits from Sodexo.
</P>
<P>
"This is a global corporation with global responsibility and we are going to
hold them accountable to that responsibility," said Glover, who has starred in
movies including "2012" and "Escape from Alcatraz."
</P>
<P>
The rally was the latest in a series of protests and civil disobedience actions
across the United States against Sodexo, which workers and trade unions accuse
of paying an unlivable wage and offering poor benefits.
</P>
<P>
"Sodexo makes its money by turning good, high-paying, benefited, full-time jobs
into low-wage, unbenefitted, part-time jobs," Stern told the rally.
</P>
<P>
French trade unionist Jean-Michel Dupire said Sodexo "has the means to respond
to your demands but it's going into the wrong pockets."
</P>
<P>
The protesters burst into cheers and began chanting, in French, "Tous ensemble"
or "All together."
</P>
<P>
The protesters said they mounted their series of actions after 16 Sodexo workers
were laid off after trying to unionize or becoming involved in union activities.
</P>
<P>
But Sodexo officials told AFP that the company is not opposed to unionization.
</P>
<P>
"We can tell you categorically that Sodexo recognizes and respects our workers'
rights to join or not join a union as they choose," Sodexo vice president for
employee and corporate relations Thomas Mackall said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the participants of these orchestrated events have not been Sodexo
employees, but rather students and others who have been incited by SEIU," his
colleague Jaya Bohlmann said, reading from a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement dismissed the demonstrations, which have been held at 11 sites
across the United States, as publicity stunts for SEIU, which Sodexo said was
trying to edge out other food service unions.
</P>
<P>
Police Captain Paul Starks told AFP the protesters were cited for trespassing
and taken to a nearby police station.
</P>
<P>
All 12 were released after the protest ended, Renee Asher of the SEIU told AFP.

US Catholic church attacks 'draconian' Arizona law
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
washington, April 27, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US Catholic church on Tuesday condemned Arizona's "draconian" new
immigration law, saying it would alienate immigrant communities across the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"This new law, although limited to the State of Arizona, could have impact
throughout the nation in terms of how members of our immigrant communities are
both perceived and treated," Bishop John Wester said in a statement issued on
behalf of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB).
</P>
<P>
"It certainly would lead to the rise in fear and distrust in immigrant
communities," Wester, who chairs the USCCB migration committee, said.
</P>
<P>
The law signed by Arizona's Republican Governor Jan Brewer on Friday allows
police in the southwestern state that shares a border with Mexico to question
and detain anyone they believe may be an illegal immigrant, even if they are not
suspected of committing another crime.
</P>
<P>
It would also require anyone in the state to show a document proving their legal
status, like a "green card" permanent residency document or a passport.
</P>
<P>
The law could lead to profiling, wrongful arrests and "the division of families
-- parents from children and husbands from wives," the USCCB said.
</P>
<P>
"The US Catholic bishops stand in solidarity with the bishops of Arizona in
opposing this draconian law," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We renew our call for the administration and Congress to work in a bipartisan
manner to enact comprehensive immigration reform as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano said earlier Tuesday at a hearing of
the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Justice Department was reviewing the
constitutionality of the new law.

utt: randman  <quote>
utt: randman  There are terrorist plots in the world, there just aren't terrorist plots like on "24."
utt: randman  
utt: randman  Interesting. 24 didn't involve the Illuminati or aliens so according to some here, no conspiracies.
utt: randman  
utt: randman  Seems like when someone shows a conspiracy that came true, others downplay as not sufficient, but things like MK-Ultra are as big a conspiracy theory as covering up alien encounters though the alien thing would be more significant.
utt: randman  
utt: randman  As far as 9/11, what do some mean by conspiracy theory?
utt: randman  That Bush did it?
utt: randman  Then not so likely.
utt: randman  That there was a 24-style cover-up because some conspiratorial elements or agents within the US government helped facilitate it?
utt: randman  
utt: randman  Believe it or not, that's entirely feasible and entirely likely the powers that be would think this is not something we can have come out for the good of the nation and international affairs.
utt: Gazpacho  The existence of the Trilateral Commission, and of its project to halt radical political movements around the world and restore a kind of liberal-authoritarian stability, are documented facts of history.
utt: Gazpacho  People might be forgiven in the 1970s for not having easy access to those documents, but today you can download them from the Commission's own web site so there's really no excuse.
utt: Gazpacho  
utt: randman  Good point.
utt: randman  How is it a conspiracy theory when the globalists openly call for world government.
utt: randman  
utt: randman  On Waco, that is likely a good candidate for a legit, true conspiracy theory.
utt: randman  it appears Reno Ok'ed or ordered spraying 9 times the lethal dosage for indoors of CS gas.
utt: randman  Say what you want but that looks awfully close to murder and we're talking women and children here.
utt: randman  Then, it looks like they also fired flash-bang devices which could easily set the "gas", really I think it's a powder, ablaze.
utt: randman  
utt: randman  The facts suggest we all watched the federal government murder a bunch of people they didn't like.
utt: randman  Even if you wanted to arrest Koresh and others and think they are killers, what excuse is there for killing the children?
utt: Patrick1000  The Courageous Italian Judge Felice Casson Was Responsible for the uncovering of "Gladio", the Italian Secret Army.
utt: Patrick1000  Once Casson got the goods on those naughty naughty naughty little boys, then the Italian Prime Minister, Giulio Andreotti had to say something, confess in a sense.
utt: Patrick1000  French President Francois Mitterrand back peddled furiously, but to no avail.
utt: Patrick1000  He claimed, "When I arrived, I didn't have much left to dissolve.
utt: Patrick1000  There only remained a few remnants, of which I learned the existence with some surprise because everyone had forgotten about them." To his credit, Andriotti called Mitterrand a coward in so many words for not being man enough if not to admit to his own complicity, which Mitterrand was, COMPLICITOUS, to at least to acknowledge the French Secret Army's robust activities.
utt: Patrick1000  It all fell like a house of cards after that, and things lead right to our front door.
utt: Patrick1000  After all, when it comes to NATO, we, the Americans, are the big Cheetos, ain't we?
utt: Patrick1000  
utt: Patrick1000  So if you want a name LSSBB, there really is only one, the Great Italian judge, Felice Casson.
utt: Patrick1000  The only guy both smart and brave enough to pull it off, expose the thing.
utt: Patrick1000  Mind boggling really, one dude vs NATO!
utt: Patrick1000  Incredibile!!!
utt: Patrick1000  
utt: Patrick1000  I am an American citizen, 2nd generation, but ethnically and culturally Sicilian to some degree.
utt: Patrick1000  I have many friends and a large family in Sicily.
utt: Patrick1000  My friends and family revere Casson, as do many Italians, more for his courage than anything else.
utt: Patrick1000  He is like Giovanni Falcone, the magistrate from Palermo who was so successful in prosecuting Mafia guys in the Maxi Trials, and got blown up for it along with his family.
utt: Patrick1000  People love these guys, admire their courage.
utt: Patrick1000  
utt: Patrick1000  One little Italian judge, showed NATO where they could stick it, right up their chicken _ _ _ _ butts.
utt: Patrick1000  BEAUTIFUL!!!!
utt: Patrick1000  BRAVO CASSON, BRAVO!!!!!!!
utt: Patrick1000  
utt: Patrick1000  So there Greg, the NATO SECRET ARMY CONSPIRACY, a conspiracy that endured from 1945 through 1990, 45 years, with activities that included the murdering of innocent people, including children, to create fear in the hearts of Europeans so US military interests could park nukes in the Europeans' front yards.
utt: Patrick1000  Pretty sick, ain't it?
utt: Patrick1000  
utt: Patrick1000  And if you have any question, wondering if it really could be true, that heinously sick, it sounds so awful after all, don't hesitate to ask the Prime Minister of Italy, Andreotti.
utt: Patrick1000  He'll confirm every atrocity for you, not to mention the President of France, Mitterrand, who said sure it went on, but he was late to the party so he won't be able to give you much in the way of details Greg..........
utt: Patrick1000  
utt: randman  Hadn't heard of this.
utt: randman  Thanks.
utt: randman  Black ops are real, on-going and frequent or were for a long time (likely still but don't have any personal knowledge).
utt: randman  They are often dismissed as conspiracy theories but such conspiracies are actually part of the fabric of history and something people need to accept and understand as not some wacko concept but how things get done sometimes.
utt: randman  Good point.
utt: randman  How is it a conspiracy theory when the globalists openly call for world government.
utt: randman  
utt: Gazpacho  It's a conspiracy theory because the press chose not to report on it, at a time when there weren't many ways to get around press silence.
utt: Gazpacho  Also because mentioning the Commission and its goals did and still does carry the stigma of being judged a loon.

utt: Oystein  Americans and foreigners of the muslim faith were murdered on 9/11.
utt: Oystein  These muslims are as much victims of the islamist terrorists as all the others, the Christians, the Jews, the Hindus, the Atheists.
utt: Oystein  
utt: Oystein  Muslims in lower Manhattan go to a mosque or prayer room there, because that's where they live ot work.
utt: Oystein  These Muslims are New Yorkers!
utt: Oystein  Just like all the others: The Christians, the Jews, the Hindus, the Atheists.
utt: Oystein  
utt: Oystein  When the planes crashed, when the towers fell, there were tens of thousands of muslim New Yorkers in downtown Manhattan, very nearly becoming victims of the atrocities.
utt: Oystein  
utt: Oystein  Now Chewy_Defense wants to make these New Yorkers, these victims of 9/11, victims again.
utt: Oystein  Victims of past terrorists, and victims of future terrorists.
utt: Oystein  
utt: SezMe  Up to this point, excellent post. From this point on, crap.
utt: SezMe  
utt: Oystein  Chewy_Defense seems to hate the freedom that the Constitution grants to all Americans.
utt: Oystein  
utt: SezMe  Bull.
utt: SezMe  He's shown no signs of hating anyone or anything.
utt: SezMe  He respects Constitutional freedoms but sees possible harm to NYC should the full extent of those freedoms be exercised by building this Muslim complex.
utt: SezMe  Like you, I think he is 100% wrong but all he is doing is expressing the fact that his values within those freedoms indicate a different course of action.
utt: SezMe  That's all.
utt: SezMe  
utt: Oystein  Chewy_Defense wants the terrorists to win.
utt: Oystein  It's like he allows them to piss on the graves of muslim New Yorkers.
utt: Oystein  
utt: SezMe  More bull.
utt: SezMe  He does not want the terrorists to win and your just throwing flame bait to make the claim.
utt: SezMe  He identifies one possible harm and wants to minimize the chances of that happening.
utt: SezMe  Now you and I disagree with him on the potential of that happening and the concomitant damage that will occur if his solution is implemented but that in no way implies his desire for a terrorist victory.
utt: SezMe  Shame on you.
utt: Thunder  I'm still waiting for JihadJane's answer, as to why Al Qaeda attacked the USA on 9-11-01.

utt: T.A.M.  They attacked in large part because of (A) USA's relationship/defense of Israel, and (B) the perceived USA Invasion, both Physically (as seen in Kuwait) and mentally of the middle east (as seen in the United Emeriates), etc...

utt: Bricker  Oh, this is cute.
utt: Bricker  They just had to overturn an election in Lee County (the South Carolina county where the sheriff just got busted for his involvement in the drug business) because they got 107% turnout.

utt: Irishman  The simplest record method is that you get a printed receipt that you can verify matches your intended vote, but without your name on it.
utt: Irishman  Then you drop that receipt into a box before leaving the polling place.
utt: Irishman  This would be just like the manual voting cards we used prior to the machines.
utt: Irishman  
utt: Irishman  If there is any funky number business, then the receipts can be counted by hand.
utt: Irishman  That's a manual recount.
utt: Irishman  
utt: Irishman  If you really want to have fun, print the receipts as scantron forms.
utt: Irishman  
utt: Irishman  Then there is a recountable record that does not have the voter's ID associated, but the voter checks before submitting, that is independent of the electronic record in the machines and any code finagling and whatnot.

utt: DanBlather  I like this idea.
utt: conurepete  That sounds really good
utt: Bricker  I don't think we can rely on voting machines when they have no way to verify the count.
utt: Bricker  The head of Diebold said his mission was to see that Bush was re-elected.
utt: Bricker  He did not say he wanted to have a great working machine.
utt: Bricker  What does it take for us to shit can them?
utt: Bricker  
utt: suranyi  Diebold no longer makes voting machines.
utt: suranyi  That part of its business was spun off into a separate company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Election_Solutions">Premier Election Solutions</a> in 2007, and that in turn was bought another company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Systems_%26_Software">Election Systems &amp; Software</a> in 2009.
utt: suranyi  So you don't have to be scared of the Diebold boogeyman anymore.
utt: suranyi  
utt: suranyi  The bigger part of Diebold's business, by far, is ATM machines.

utt: Kalevalatar  The Jewish minority in Finland at the time was small, 1,500 (of total population of 3.5 million), of whom some 350 served in the three Finnish "WWII" wars, the Winter War, the Continuation War, and the Lapland War; 23 gave their life for defending their home country.
utt: Kalevalatar  Quite a few were promoted Captains.
utt: Kalevalatar  Salomon Klass is perhaps the most notable, as a commander of a battalion.
utt: Kalevalatar  Please note that there were no seperate "Jewish" battalion or regiment and no segregation based on religion or some such, rather all Finnish soldiers served in their own "home" battalions and units.
utt: Kalevalatar  
utt: Kalevalatar  While many Finnish women, too, contributed by serving in a voluntary auxiliary paramilitary home guard for women called the "Lottas" (after Lotta Svärd), Finnish women of Jewish faith were not granted an entry until after the Winter War when the Lotta organization first granted membership to two Finnish ladies of Muslim faith (Tatars, another Finnish minority, who also served on the front as Finnish soldiers).
utt: Kalevalatar  Since the Lotta pledge was given in the (Lutheran) church with a promise to defend "religion, home and homeland," prejudices lingered whether the non-Christian Finns could be trusted to take the pledge.
utt: Kalevalatar  Unfortunately, I can't seem to find the number of women of Jewish faith who served in the Continuation and Lapland wars.
utt: Kalevalatar  
utt: Kalevalatar  Indeed, three Finns of the Jewish community were awarded with the German Iron Cross, but none were accepted.
utt: Kalevalatar  Captain Leo Skurnik (who as a medic saved several German lives), Captain Salomon Klass and Dina Poljakoff, a female Lotta.

utt: Kalevalatar  Films to watch:
utt: Kalevalatar  
utt: Kalevalatar  The Unknown Soldier ( Tuntematon sotilas <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048752/">1955</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090215/">the 1985 remake</a> ).
utt: Kalevalatar  
utt: Kalevalatar  Based on the highly regarded novel by Väinö Linna.
utt: Kalevalatar  Both versions are excellent and considered "a must" in Finland.

utt: Kalevalatar  
utt: Kalevalatar  Highly recommended!
utt: Kalevalatar  This is a commercial action/war film, but it also has beautiful Biblical scenes and themes interwowen in it (as hinted by the cross on display on the hero's neck in the promotinal poster).

utt: Kalevalatar  Also rather thick with a Christian message, as hinted by the title.

utt: Biblicist  Hi Kalevalatar,
utt: Biblicist  
utt: Biblicist  Thanks for posting your material - very interesting.
utt: Biblicist  Undoubtedly you have more than just a slight personal interest in Finlands history whereas someone like myself from Australia, it tends to be more academic but even so I was surprised that I came across this information as late as I have.
utt: Biblicist  
utt: Biblicist  Leaving aside the fact that Finland was fighting for its very survival; for me the situation is absolutely fascinating as it blurs the border between the supposed good side and the bad side.
utt: Biblicist  
utt: Biblicist  Even though I would have supported the Russians against the Germans in general and especially with the German attack on Stalingrad; if I were to have crossed into Finland I probably would have ended up supporting some of the German regiments which were fighting alongside Finish units against Soviet aggression toward Finland.
utt: Biblicist  Of course whenever these units moved back into Norway then these same German units would then become the enemy.
utt: Biblicist  
utt: Biblicist  Even though we are talking about human calamity and suffering, the complexities regarding Finlands involvement with Germany during this period is again a fascinating piece of history.
utt: Biblicist  
utt: Biblicist  My understanding is that the US kept a legation in Finland up until about 6 months before D-Day, do you have any information on this?
utt: Biblicist  
utt: Biblicist  Most importantly, do you have any information regarding the views that were held by the Christians during this time?

utt: Nash24  I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread, but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter.
utt: Nash24  I'm a British Pakistani, born and brought up in London, however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side.
utt: Nash24  Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan 'Don't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan', made a few years ago, yet a very interesting watch.
utt: Nash24  I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times, and have traveled throughout the country, so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it's people.
utt: Nash24  However, after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked.
utt: Nash24  I may be wrong when I say this, but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state, yet only 64 years on and I don't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with.
utt: Nash24  It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture, in a sense it boosts their superiority complex.
utt: Nash24  I actually find it shocking, that most families who moved to England in the 60's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan.
utt: Nash24  Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting, it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction- the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further.
utt: Nash24  Also whilst I'm on this topic, has anyone seen the film 'Slackistan' and what were your views?
utt: Nash24  Thank for reading my thoughts! <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>
utt: Nash24  
utt: lonely14  
utt: lonely14  So, you want to protect or retain a culture, which sanctifies the practices of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing">honour killing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_burning">bride burning</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_throwing">acid throwing</a>, the abominable practice of <a href="http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/7523/female-genital-mutilation-in-pakistan-and-beyond/">female genital mutilation</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/8967/prostitution-in-the-land-of-the-pure/">sexual abuse</a> ?
utt: lonely14  
utt: lonely14  Not to forget the tradition of <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2011/09/07/bartered-in-marriage-the-bride-exchange-in-rural-pakistan.html">Barter marriages</a>, young girls forcefully married to much older men, and some in extreme cases married to Quran itself! <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/shock.gif" alt=":shock:"/>
utt: lonely14  
utt: lonely14  One wonders why Pakistan is the <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/idINIndia-57704120110615">world's third most dangerous country for women</a> to live in?
utt: lonely14  
utt: lonely14  Yet you're worried about upper classes choosing to indulge in a bit of harmless fun? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> As a Pakistani, I welcome western influence on our culture - it might help Pakistan to become a more civilized society.
utt: lonely14  
utt: lonely14  Edit: I watched that Saira Khan's documentary you're referring to a few months ago.
utt: lonely14  I would like to know what you found so offensive?
utt: lonely14  She was sympathetic to the plight of transgender community in Pakistan - isn't that a positive thing? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>

utt: VeniViciVidi  Personally, any nation's judiciary system that is in anyway influenced by objective morality scriptures and superstition has no place in the 21st century.
utt: VeniViciVidi  While I can understand your sentiment that is undesirable for tradition to be dismantled, ever since the fall of the wall in 1989, Liberal democratic values have spread (End of History, Fukuyama, 1992) and that does not preclude (just yet) the sovereign states whom are conformed to Islamic teachings as their rule of law.
utt: VeniViciVidi  
utt: VeniViciVidi  Western culture gives people individuality and lets them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberties they desire (as long as it doesn't harm anybody else).
utt: VeniViciVidi  I think it is the right direction that Western culture (unforced) is spreading, it gives a common ground for different cultures to interact, promotes tolerance and allows people to pick their own way of life.
utt: VeniViciVidi  I don't see that being a problem.
utt: VeniViciVidi  
utt: Nash24  
utt: Nash24  Sorry, in hindsight I really do think I should have written the post a little better.
utt: Nash24  I do not think our culture is perfect, there are many traditions that I do believe in at all and am strongly against, yet I do think that the moral values taught through culture and religion should definitely be retained.
utt: Nash24  Following your point, I think that to an extent in the 21st century we require a society based on basic morals and values, I feel that these are the foundations.
utt: Nash24  I agree with you in the sense that western culture does encourage individuality, definitely!
utt: Nash24  It has helped to shape the country, allowed women to have more rights and freedom.
utt: Nash24  I mean now in Pakistan, it is common for women to work and I totally support this.
utt: Nash24  Women should have as much right as any man.
utt: Nash24  I think the next step forward in Pakistan is adopting the western idea of equality, which is severely lacking there.
utt: oh-my-diddy  yeah unfortunate isnt it.
utt: oh-my-diddy  i think the country is deteriorating fast.
utt: oh-my-diddy  so much corruption aswell.
utt: oh-my-diddy  its no wonder they're not doing well economically.
utt: oh-my-diddy  
utt: Nash24  
utt: Nash24  It has a lot to do with the government, when the politicians are corrupt, there is little hope for the country.
utt: Nash24  What Pakistan needs is a strong leader, focused on the well-being of it's people rather than power and money.

utt: Bananaman  You're prabably expecting an emotional plea. This isn't one.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  I've read so many 9/11 conspiracy theorist threads I'm practically an expert.
utt: Bananaman  OK, I'm not not engineer or architect or pilot, which will surprise no-one who has ever had to delete one of my posts, but for God's sake, it's just reached risible levels now.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  Sooner or later every debunker reaches the stage where they just want to whack the miscreant round the head and tell him not to be stupid.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  They're faced with facts. They ignore them.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  They're faced with evidence. The evidence is lies.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  They're faced with bloody horrific in your face proof that they're wrong and they ask silly childish questions about millisecond anomolies.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  I shouldn't want to punch the nincompoops, but I do.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  So why do I still wish sense to be bashed into their silly heads?
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  Quite simply because they're pissing on the graves of those who died.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  If someone you cared about was murdered, for whatever reason, and the perpetrator was exonerated, if that's the word I want, in favour of an innocent party, I'd be pretty bloody upset.
utt: Bananaman  The same principle applies here.
utt: Bananaman  Those who died on 9/11 deserve better than to have their murderers excused as puppets, or whatever the latest fantasy they've dreamed up is.
utt: Bananaman  It's too sick.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  Well, that's it.
utt: Bananaman  That's why I no longer laugh at them.
utt: Bananaman  I prefer to spit.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  Those idiots at the memorial last week...hmmm, let's just say, I wish everyone there had just flicked the V sign at them and thrown the odd bottle of urine, just as if it was a crap band on the stage.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  Bananaman (The pissed off)
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  p.s.
utt: Bananaman  admittedly I did get a little emotional, but not in a good way.
utt: Myriad  As the eager easily-duped suburban kids move on to new fads and become thin on the ground and the "say anything as long as it's against Bush" contingent see increasing alternative avenues for their political disaffection, we're seeing the residue of the movement and their nature and motivations are becoming clearer.
utt: Myriad  
utt: Myriad  The anti-Semites and Nazis, we're already familiar with.
utt: Myriad  The career conspiracy exploiters and the lunatics they exploit, we're already familiar with.
utt: Myriad  But there's a significant segment of the most recent wave of Internet truther trolls that appears to be more motivated by direct sympathy for the same Islamic fundamentalist Jihadist ideals (which after cutting through the centuries-old political and religious smokescreens basically come down to "stop giving human rights to women or we lose all hope of getting laid") that motivated the 9/11 attacks in the first place.
utt: Myriad  
utt: Myriad  The Jihadists have little hope of being able to hijack any more planes so easily.
utt: Myriad  But pissing on the graves of their past victims is easily within their, or their supporters', capabilities.
utt: Myriad  I don't expect that movement to end any time soon.
utt: Myriad  
utt: Myriad  Respectfully,
utt: Myriad  Myriad
utt: liverleef  I'm fairly conservative (fiscally anyway) but I can have a rational conversation with someone who has polar opposite views.
utt: liverleef  Sometimes I even change my position a little if they present a good argument.
utt: liverleef  I'm open minded and I just don't take things as personally as others do.
utt: liverleef  
utt: liverleef  The only person that I absolutely cannot keep my cool with is a truther.
utt: liverleef  I've been asked why I'm so opposed to a second investigation.
utt: liverleef  I usually blurt out that the truth movements goal is not a second investigation, their goal is to absolve al Qaeda of the murder of thousands of innocent people and that makes me mad.
utt: liverleef  Really, really mad.
utt: liverleef  
utt: liverleef  To add to what Myriad said, I think that after the election, particularly if Obama is elected, it will be interesting to see what happens to the truth movement.
utt: liverleef  Many people fall into this group because of blind hatred of President Bush.
utt: liverleef  Most of those truthers are likely to just move on after the election and look for other things to be pissed off about.
utt: liverleef  
utt: liverleef  Thats when we are going to really have a look at the far right wing anti-government loonies, nazis, anti-semites, etc that make up the core of the truth movement.

utt: GunnerBill  I happened to watch a news review on Sky News this morning in which a bunch of journo's were bleating on that we shouldn't condemn all the "innocent" and hard working journalists at News International just because a whole bunch of hacks at the Sun were arrested...
utt: GunnerBill  because that would cause untold damage to the whole media industry.
utt: GunnerBill  
utt: GunnerBill  Oh poor them. <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>
utt: GunnerBill  
utt: GunnerBill  This is precsisely, is it not?, what the whole media has been doing to the banking industry for the last two years or so?
utt: GunnerBill  
utt: GunnerBill  Total hypocrisy. <img src="images/smilies/angry.gif"/>
utt: GunnerBill  
utt: GunnerBill  It is important to seperate the innocent from the guilty in both industries but it's ironic that the papers have been selling copy by basically tarring all bankers with the same brush and slagging them off mercilessly for years.
utt: ak137  Isnt Sky News owned by BSkyB which is owned by News international or something?
utt: ak137  It doesnt surprise me though, lets hope Murdoch goes down.

utt: JoanneDorel  What I want to know is what do you really have against Jesse.
utt: JoanneDorel  I know him personally, I have marhed with him, and have worked for him.
utt: JoanneDorel  My favorite march with Jesse was the one from the chicken processing plant in N.
utt: JoanneDorel  Carolina where 120 women died in a fire because the owners locked the emergency exit so no one could sneak outside for a break.
utt: JoanneDorel  Wher the women even those pregnant were not allowed any breaks except a 30 minute lunch perid.
utt: JoanneDorel  We walked from the factory to the State Capitol in an effort to get the owners to provide some financial support to the children and families of the women who died.
utt: JoanneDorel  What is so wrong with that do to Jesse's efforts some benefits were paid by the company and the state relented and released some money too.
utt: BillW  george, you just fully described me.
utt: BillW  As low a person as you think I am, I am really OK.
utt: BillW  I live, I breath, I love, I bleed red blood and I am one of those whose "worst qualities of an age and much of a generation notable mostly for its narcism and self-indulgence.
utt: BillW  The irony of wistful recollections of past protest adventures clothed as they were in a style and form so like their own caricatures of the "reactionary" forces they opposed" and yet I fought on the ground in Viet Nam.
utt: BillW  
utt: BillW  You know what - we were possibly over there at the same time, and I called and was a grateful receiver of many an air strick we called in.
utt: BillW  You may have been one of the bombers, I was one of those grunts on the other side of the "red smoke".
utt: BillW  Do you realize I was 1 1/2 clicks from a full blown B-52 strike.
utt: BillW  The B-52s were 6 miles away.
utt: BillW  You have no idea how scary it is for the bombs to be walking toward you and you only realized they were going to miss you as they went away.
utt: BillW  Yes, I was there and I was also one of "THEM" - before I went, while I was there and after I got back!
utt: BillW  
utt: BillW  Herbert Spencer addresses this issue directly, "There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance--that principle is contempt prior to investigation."
utt: BillW  
utt: BillW  But, for this I forgive you because God already has!
utt: edgarblythe  Joanne, the reason I have refused to argue about Jesse is because his detractors are too irrational about it.
utt: edgarblythe  They all parrot identical words and phrases like they all memorized the same little pamphlet.
utt: edgarblythe  As soon as you say anything in his defense they morph into "Jesse and Al sharpton".
utt: edgarblythe  Any more and it's suddenly "Jesse and Al sharpton and farakhan".
utt: edgarblythe  Endless name calling and nothing gets resolved.
utt: mikey  Georgeob1....I sat on the curbstone with my friends as they shed their tears, the rough tough macho guys, as I'm sure we all did, and listened to them pour their hearts out, 'if they came home alive', the guys that were "lucky" to come back, and not in a body bag, ball less, legless, armless, footless.
utt: mikey  or in a wheelchair forever.
utt: mikey  And for what? You tell me.
utt: mikey  
utt: mikey  This country has lost sight of itself.
utt: edgarblythe  I stand by my assessment of Nixon and Cambodia.
utt: edgarblythe  I stand by everything I have said on this thread.
utt: edgarblythe  I consider that the Peace Movement and the Civil Rights Movement in conjunction embodied most of the more noble attributes of human striving, in that or any age.
utt: BillW  george, I wanted to add one very important thing, I go a lot with gut feeling - it's my way.
utt: BillW  I feel you are a good man, I truly like you.
utt: BillW  One person's higher morals - another person sees as a fault.
utt: BillW  In the end we are all the same and we return to worm food!
utt: JoanneDorel  I think the guys that fled to Canada were heros too.
utt: JoanneDorel  They gave up the comforts of home and being surrounded by friends and family let alone there status as wanted criminals.
utt: JoanneDorel  
utt: JoanneDorel  Everyone made choices in that horrible war, we all wre affected.
utt: JoanneDorel  No one experience is more than any other.
utt: BillW  It sent society into shambles - it was the destroyer of families, friendships and politics today are the result of the chasm.
utt: BillW  I have live my life on these issue, it is my pariah and and it is my saviour.
utt: BillW  Unfortunately, today it is coming back to haunt us.
utt: BillW  If GWB continues his course he will never be forgiven.
utt: BillW  Are there no lessons learned!
utt: edgarblythe  You are right BillW

utt: Pale Rider  Sorry, liar, but the case that was brought and won against the NBP was DISMISSED by the direct orders of the RACIST Eric Holder.
utt: Pale Rider  
utt: ClosedCaption  
utt: ClosedCaption  The Bush administration’s Justice Department — not the Obama administration — made the decision not to pursue criminal charges against members of the New Black Panther Party for alleged voter intimidation at a polling center in Philadelphia in 2008
utt: ClosedCaption  
utt: ClosedCaption  You mad?
utt: ClosedCaption  
utt: Pale Rider  
utt: Pale Rider  Nope, sorry, liar... You a dumbass...
utt: Pale Rider  
utt: Pale Rider  The U.S.
utt: Pale Rider  Department of Justice seal bears a Latin phrase: "Qui Pro Domina Justitia Sequitur." The motto refers to the attorney general, "who prosecutes on behalf of Lady Justice." But under President Barack Obama's politically corrupt DOJ, Lady Justice is getting the shaft.
utt: Pale Rider  
utt: Pale Rider  To wit: Let's examine the uproar over Attorney General Eric Holder's decision to protect hate-mongering thugs who harassed and bullied precinct workers and voters on Election Day in Philadelphia.
utt: Pale Rider  Oh, wait.
utt: Pale Rider  There's been no uproar.
utt: Pale Rider  Let me tell you why.
utt: Pale Rider  
utt: Pale Rider  Two weeks ago, in a highly unusual move, Holder dismissed default judgments his department had won against two of three defendants charged with violating the Voting Rights Act.
utt: Pale Rider  On Nov. 4, 2008, a billy club-wielding militant in military-style boots and beret stood outside a Philly polling location with a similarly dressed partner.
utt: Pale Rider  
utt: Pale Rider  
utt: ClosedCaption  
utt: ClosedCaption  Bush DOJ decided there was no case there.
utt: ClosedCaption  
utt: ClosedCaption  Your Southern Strategy wont work here.
utt: ClosedCaption  
utt: ClosedCaption  You mad?

utt: CrusaderFrank  
utt: CrusaderFrank  Obama's Marxism: this time it'll work, we swear!
utt: CrusaderFrank  We have it figured out perfectly now
utt: MarcATL  Had it been any one of those other palookas, say, Cain'n'Palin the country would have been in shambles.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  Obama has pulled the country back from the brink of disaster that Bush'n'Cheney had left it in.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  He's created ObamaCare, because, as we all know, Obama cares.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  He's brought dignity back to the Office.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  The economy has been steadily ticking up.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  He saved GM...a WHOPPING success.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  He got Bin Laden from a place that Bush didn't dare to go into.
utt: MarcATL  Khaddaffi's gone.
utt: MarcATL  Pirates of the seas know they can't 'EFF around with Americans or any of their properties.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  He helped to liberate a country from a tyrant w/o spending too much time, money and with no casualties.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  The rest of the world knows the same.
utt: MarcATL  Although he's not going around screaming about how big'n'tuff 'Murrka is.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  He's pulling us out of war.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  And, once again, the economy continues to tick up, despite his opponents in the GOP's efforts to undermine him at every.
utt: MarcATL  single.
utt: MarcATL  turn.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  Yeah...I'd say Obama's a shoe-in for the next election.

utt: Oldstyle  
utt: Oldstyle  I guess if you ignore the fact that he can't submit budgets...is the first American President to have our credit rating downgraded...ran up more debt in a shorter amount of time than anyone in history...has a "signature" piece of legislation, ObamaCare, that not only doesn't lower health care cost but is probably the most badly written law ever and will be ruled unconstitutional...appointed the same man who got Marc Rich off for a lump sum payment to the Clintons as his Attorney General...appointed a man who couldn't figure out TurboTax as our Treasury Secretary...fast tracked Solyndra and made it the "showcase" of his green jobs initiative...spent a trillion dollars on his "stimulus" only to see unemployment go from 8% to over 10...stonewalled drilling permits in the Gulf and the oil pipeline to placate his environmental base while throwing tens of thousands of jobless Americans under the bus...gave us expensive programs like Cash for Clunkers that ate up billions of taxpayer dollars and didn't jumpstart the economy...has deteriorated our relationship with Israel to it's worst state ever while he tried to "reason" with Iran...has no coherent energy policy...no coherent housing policy...no coherent trade policy...has shown absolutely no ability to forge a bipartisan approach to governing...and has spent the majority of his time campaigning for a second term rather than doing the actual job of President.
utt: Oldstyle  Other than all that...he's just great, Marc!!!

utt: nmds  -- 4th January 1932 --
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  80 years ago today India’s National Congress, the largest and most powerful force in the movement for Indian self-rule, was declared illegal by the British government and its leader, Gandhi, was arrested in Bombay.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  And generally this is considered by all moderns a Very Bad Thing.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  15 years later the Imperial powers finally assented to Gandhi’s idea, common to average Englishmen and Indians alike, that India belonged to the Indians, and in 1947 India was granted formal independence from rule by the British government.
utt: nmds  Other nationalist movements were succeeding and seceding throughout Asia and Africa at around the same time.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  And generally this is considered by all moderns a Very Good Thing.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  But immediately that African and Asian peoples were permitted to enjoy freedom from colonisation by Europeans and self-determination, equivalent privileges were withdrawn from the European peoples.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  An invasion of Europe began that would soon dwarf any colonisation by Europeans of Africa and Asia; governmental powers began to be transferred to a foreign bureaucracy in Brussels and Strasbourg; and all estates of the government plus the increasingly powerful fourth estate began a process of deconstructing culturally and psychologically the peoples of Europe as such.
utt: nmds  There can be no bothersome self-determination when the self no longer admits of its own existence.
utt: nmds  India might belong to the Indians, but henceforth, if not already, England would not belong to the English, nor Germany to the Germans, etc.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  Naturally the normal people of Europe were opposed to all this, but their wishes were ignored.
utt: nmds  Anytime the restless natives of Europe looked like mounting a serious democratic challenge to the new old imperialists, the political vehicle in question was made illegal by its ‘democratic’ ‘anti-fascist’ rival in power.
utt: nmds  Most recently Britain’s BNP was dragged through the courts and made to change its constitution and disavow it’s reason for being -- where it had previously been explicitly concerned with protecting the native peoples of Britain, it now had to prove its concern with protecting the native peoples of every other country on earth from its own members and supporters.
utt: nmds  You will see why I began by remembering the Regime’s illegalisation of the Indian National Congress.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  And generally these anti-European double standards are considered by all TSRers a Very Good Thing.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  Or are they? (By which I mean ‘Discuss.’)
utt: nmds  
utt: Ravin McRaven  
utt: Ravin McRaven  South Africa, namibia, USA, australia, canada, argentina, brazil, new zealand ?- nope, no europeans there, are there.
utt: Ravin McRaven  And of course you would never see europeans in india, kenya, hong kong, Abu dhabi, sri lanka, fiji, malaysia, thailand etc etc.
utt: Ravin McRaven  No of course not, they are all arressted and deported back to Dover on a daily basis
utt: whyumadtho  nmds, a 'nation', as you're using it, has no 'separate or politically independent territory', according to your sacrosanct OED.
utt: whyumadtho  No nation has prerogative over a space.
utt: whyumadtho  
utt: whyumadtho  Try again.
utt: whyumadtho  
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  I don't understand -- I consider the Indians, the Jews, and the Tswana to be nations -- and they appear to possess separate or politically independent territories' devoted to their interests, namely India, Israel and Botswana -- out of which they booted us.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  In general I would say any people anywhere is entitled at any time to declare itself sovereign and independent.
utt: nmds  I'm surprised to find you disagree.
utt: nmds  What else is slavery but the denial of a right to secede and be independent?
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  [Thanks for actually responding to what I wrote though.
utt: nmds  Makes a nice ****ing change for you!]

utt: Repatriated Canuck  What the hell is going on with aboriginals around the planet.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  I've just come home from a long stint in Australia thinking that aboriginals back in Canada are far better off (relatively speaking) and now we have the Red Cross out at Attawapiskat community.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  In Australia you know straight away the difference as soon as you arrive in an aboriginal community.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  They are run down garbage everywhere with people just sitting about doing nothing.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  In Canada it seems no better.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Here in Yellowknife there is a reservation by the old town and you don't need to see the teepee to know you've crossed some kind of border.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  In an instant the houses viewed have not received a coat of paint in years.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Broken down cars and skidoos litter yards and unlike the neighborhood 10 metres away they have cut down almost every tree.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Whatever happened to being in tune with nature?
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Addictions and sexual abuse run high.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Communities in Canada and Australia outright ban alcohol in a vain effort to stem problems.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Jails are filled with them and the life expectancy is much lower than the rest of both countries.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  I'm getting tired of seeing it and wondering what can be done.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  The bleeding heart efforts have done nothing but bred a generation of people who refuse to work and blame everyone for their issues.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  A glaring example is the death of a small child in Australia who was electrocuted inside a wall.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  The family then blamed the government for the dilapidated condition of the house.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  I'm sure the house came with a child sized hole kicked in already.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  At the same time other communities are left without proper infrastructure like Attawapiskat but as I just learnt on the news they have been allocated 80 million since 2006.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Where did all the bloody money go?
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  I'm wondering if it's time to give these tiny outpost communities some hard choices.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Either live out bush like your ancestors and be done with it or move closer to larger settlements.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  These communities are disgusting and a drain on the rest of us.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  There seems no hope in these areas.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Suicide rates are sky high indicting desperation and sadness.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  So if the kids don't kill themselves they end up in jail and it's every ones fault other than their own.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  I do understand some of the hardships in recent memory that need to overcome such as the stolen generation and residential schools.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  This sympathy only stretches a finite amount though.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Any ideas on what should be done because we are going nowhere and things that are being tried only breed resentment and anger.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  An example there is fishing rights then natives trying to sell caught fish for profit.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Or the reverse racist laws that have kept me out of my field of work for five months because I'm the wrong colour.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  The kicker there is that my family is close to getting our status back and even then I am the wrong type of indian....
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Of course ticking that aboriginal box gives me an unfair advantage over someone who is more qualified.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  It would be hard not to use that which leads me to feel it should be abolished as well.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  My missus dislikes my hard heart attitude but I can draw so many parallels with Africa it's not good.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Is there some sort of middle ground?
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  I don't like seeing people suffer and something needs to change but how can we go about forcing it?
utt: Repatriated Canuck  For many of the youth of these communities it's past breaking point.
utt: Aussiegunner  I agree that people in Aboriginal communities need to help themselves if they are going to have a decent standard of living and helping themselves usually involves leaving the dust bowls where they live for somewhere where there is economic opportunity.
utt: Aussiegunner  Many from Aboriginal communities know that as well,they are usually the ones who have left.
utt: Aussiegunner  Unfortunately white people lecturing them on this won't change their minds, it just pisses them off.
utt: Aussiegunner  
utt: Aussiegunner  All we can do is to protect the children as well as we can with law enforcement, health care and adequate housing, and to provide the educational opportunities for those who want to do better to do so, so that they can work out for themselves that the should leave.
utt: Aussiegunner  If the rest of them want to live miserable squalid lives, despite the efforts of the broader Australian and Canadian communities to make amens for the wrongs of the past by providing all they need to take the opportunity for a better life, then we can all go to sleep at night with a clear concience.
utt: Aussiegunner  I know I do.

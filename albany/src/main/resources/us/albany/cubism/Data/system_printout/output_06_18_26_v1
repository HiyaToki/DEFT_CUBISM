utt: randman  <quote>
utt: randman  There are terrorist plots in the world, there just aren't terrorist plots like on "24."
utt: randman  
utt: randman  Interesting. 24 didn't involve the Illuminati or aliens so according to some here, no conspiracies.
utt: randman  
utt: randman  Seems like when someone shows a conspiracy that came true, others downplay as not sufficient, but things like MK-Ultra are as big a conspiracy theory as covering up alien encounters though the alien thing would be more significant.
utt: randman  
utt: randman  As far as 9/11, what do some mean by conspiracy theory?
utt: randman  That Bush did it?
utt: randman  Then not so likely.
utt: randman  That there was a 24-style cover-up because some conspiratorial elements or agents within the US government helped facilitate it?
utt: randman  
utt: randman  Believe it or not, that's entirely feasible and entirely likely the powers that be would think this is not something we can have come out for the good of the nation and international affairs.
utt: Gazpacho  The existence of the Trilateral Commission, and of its project to halt radical political movements around the world and restore a kind of liberal-authoritarian stability, are documented facts of history.
utt: Gazpacho  People might be forgiven in the 1970s for not having easy access to those documents, but today you can download them from the Commission's own web site so there's really no excuse.
utt: Gazpacho  
utt: randman  Good point.
utt: randman  How is it a conspiracy theory when the globalists openly call for world government.
utt: randman  
utt: randman  On Waco, that is likely a good candidate for a legit, true conspiracy theory.
utt: randman  it appears Reno Ok'ed or ordered spraying 9 times the lethal dosage for indoors of CS gas.
utt: randman  Say what you want but that looks awfully close to murder and we're talking women and children here.
utt: randman  Then, it looks like they also fired flash-bang devices which could easily set the "gas", really I think it's a powder, ablaze.
utt: randman  
utt: randman  The facts suggest we all watched the federal government murder a bunch of people they didn't like.
utt: randman  Even if you wanted to arrest Koresh and others and think they are killers, what excuse is there for killing the children?
utt: Patrick1000  The Courageous Italian Judge Felice Casson Was Responsible for the uncovering of "Gladio", the Italian Secret Army.
utt: Patrick1000  Once Casson got the goods on those naughty naughty naughty little boys, then the Italian Prime Minister, Giulio Andreotti had to say something, confess in a sense.
utt: Patrick1000  French President Francois Mitterrand back peddled furiously, but to no avail.
utt: Patrick1000  He claimed, "When I arrived, I didn't have much left to dissolve.
utt: Patrick1000  There only remained a few remnants, of which I learned the existence with some surprise because everyone had forgotten about them." To his credit, Andriotti called Mitterrand a coward in so many words for not being man enough if not to admit to his own complicity, which Mitterrand was, COMPLICITOUS, to at least to acknowledge the French Secret Army's robust activities.
utt: Patrick1000  It all fell like a house of cards after that, and things lead right to our front door.
utt: Patrick1000  After all, when it comes to NATO, we, the Americans, are the big Cheetos, ain't we?
utt: Patrick1000  
utt: Patrick1000  So if you want a name LSSBB, there really is only one, the Great Italian judge, Felice Casson.
utt: Patrick1000  The only guy both smart and brave enough to pull it off, expose the thing.
utt: Patrick1000  Mind boggling really, one dude vs NATO!
utt: Patrick1000  Incredibile!!!
utt: Patrick1000  
utt: Patrick1000  I am an American citizen, 2nd generation, but ethnically and culturally Sicilian to some degree.
utt: Patrick1000  I have many friends and a large family in Sicily.
utt: Patrick1000  My friends and family revere Casson, as do many Italians, more for his courage than anything else.
utt: Patrick1000  He is like Giovanni Falcone, the magistrate from Palermo who was so successful in prosecuting Mafia guys in the Maxi Trials, and got blown up for it along with his family.
utt: Patrick1000  People love these guys, admire their courage.
utt: Patrick1000  
utt: Patrick1000  One little Italian judge, showed NATO where they could stick it, right up their chicken _ _ _ _ butts.
utt: Patrick1000  BEAUTIFUL!!!!
utt: Patrick1000  BRAVO CASSON, BRAVO!!!!!!!
utt: Patrick1000  
utt: Patrick1000  So there Greg, the NATO SECRET ARMY CONSPIRACY, a conspiracy that endured from 1945 through 1990, 45 years, with activities that included the murdering of innocent people, including children, to create fear in the hearts of Europeans so US military interests could park nukes in the Europeans' front yards.
utt: Patrick1000  Pretty sick, ain't it?
utt: Patrick1000  
utt: Patrick1000  And if you have any question, wondering if it really could be true, that heinously sick, it sounds so awful after all, don't hesitate to ask the Prime Minister of Italy, Andreotti.
utt: Patrick1000  He'll confirm every atrocity for you, not to mention the President of France, Mitterrand, who said sure it went on, but he was late to the party so he won't be able to give you much in the way of details Greg..........
utt: Patrick1000  
utt: randman  Hadn't heard of this.
utt: randman  Thanks.
utt: randman  Black ops are real, on-going and frequent or were for a long time (likely still but don't have any personal knowledge).
utt: randman  They are often dismissed as conspiracy theories but such conspiracies are actually part of the fabric of history and something people need to accept and understand as not some wacko concept but how things get done sometimes.
utt: randman  Good point.
utt: randman  How is it a conspiracy theory when the globalists openly call for world government.
utt: randman  
utt: Gazpacho  It's a conspiracy theory because the press chose not to report on it, at a time when there weren't many ways to get around press silence.
utt: Gazpacho  Also because mentioning the Commission and its goals did and still does carry the stigma of being judged a loon.

utt: Oystein  Americans and foreigners of the muslim faith were murdered on 9/11.
utt: Oystein  These muslims are as much victims of the islamist terrorists as all the others, the Christians, the Jews, the Hindus, the Atheists.
utt: Oystein  
utt: Oystein  Muslims in lower Manhattan go to a mosque or prayer room there, because that's where they live ot work.
utt: Oystein  These Muslims are New Yorkers!
utt: Oystein  Just like all the others: The Christians, the Jews, the Hindus, the Atheists.
utt: Oystein  
utt: Oystein  When the planes crashed, when the towers fell, there were tens of thousands of muslim New Yorkers in downtown Manhattan, very nearly becoming victims of the atrocities.
utt: Oystein  
utt: Oystein  Now Chewy_Defense wants to make these New Yorkers, these victims of 9/11, victims again.
utt: Oystein  Victims of past terrorists, and victims of future terrorists.
utt: Oystein  
utt: SezMe  Up to this point, excellent post. From this point on, crap.
utt: SezMe  
utt: Oystein  Chewy_Defense seems to hate the freedom that the Constitution grants to all Americans.
utt: Oystein  
utt: SezMe  Bull.
utt: SezMe  He's shown no signs of hating anyone or anything.
utt: SezMe  He respects Constitutional freedoms but sees possible harm to NYC should the full extent of those freedoms be exercised by building this Muslim complex.
utt: SezMe  Like you, I think he is 100% wrong but all he is doing is expressing the fact that his values within those freedoms indicate a different course of action.
utt: SezMe  That's all.
utt: SezMe  
utt: Oystein  Chewy_Defense wants the terrorists to win.
utt: Oystein  It's like he allows them to piss on the graves of muslim New Yorkers.
utt: Oystein  
utt: SezMe  More bull.
utt: SezMe  He does not want the terrorists to win and your just throwing flame bait to make the claim.
utt: SezMe  He identifies one possible harm and wants to minimize the chances of that happening.
utt: SezMe  Now you and I disagree with him on the potential of that happening and the concomitant damage that will occur if his solution is implemented but that in no way implies his desire for a terrorist victory.
utt: SezMe  Shame on you.
utt: Thunder  I'm still waiting for JihadJane's answer, as to why Al Qaeda attacked the USA on 9-11-01.

utt: Bricker  Oh, this is cute.
utt: Bricker  They just had to overturn an election in Lee County (the South Carolina county where the sheriff just got busted for his involvement in the drug business) because they got 107% turnout.

utt: Merijeek  See what happens when you have a Democrat president?
utt: Merijeek

utt: Irishman  The simplest record method is that you get a printed receipt that you can verify matches your intended vote, but without your name on it.
utt: Irishman  Then you drop that receipt into a box before leaving the polling place.
utt: Irishman  This would be just like the manual voting cards we used prior to the machines.
utt: Irishman  
utt: Irishman  If there is any funky number business, then the receipts can be counted by hand.
utt: Irishman  That's a manual recount.
utt: Irishman  
utt: Irishman  If you really want to have fun, print the receipts as scantron forms.
utt: Irishman  
utt: Irishman  Then there is a recountable record that does not have the voter's ID associated, but the voter checks before submitting, that is independent of the electronic record in the machines and any code finagling and whatnot.

utt: DanBlather  I like this idea.
utt: conurepete  That sounds really good
utt: Bricker  I don't think we can rely on voting machines when they have no way to verify the count.
utt: Bricker  The head of Diebold said his mission was to see that Bush was re-elected.
utt: Bricker  He did not say he wanted to have a great working machine.
utt: Bricker  What does it take for us to shit can them?
utt: Bricker  
utt: suranyi  Diebold no longer makes voting machines.
utt: suranyi  That part of its business was spun off into a separate company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Election_Solutions">Premier Election Solutions</a> in 2007, and that in turn was bought another company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Systems_%26_Software">Election Systems &amp; Software</a> in 2009.
utt: suranyi  So you don't have to be scared of the Diebold boogeyman anymore.
utt: suranyi  
utt: suranyi  The bigger part of Diebold's business, by far, is ATM machines.

utt: suranyi  Fine, just don't talk about Diebold voting machines anymore.
utt: suranyi  Talk about ES &amp; S.

utt: Kalevalatar  The Jewish minority in Finland at the time was small, 1,500 (of total population of 3.5 million), of whom some 350 served in the three Finnish "WWII" wars, the Winter War, the Continuation War, and the Lapland War; 23 gave their life for defending their home country.
utt: Kalevalatar  Quite a few were promoted Captains.
utt: Kalevalatar  Salomon Klass is perhaps the most notable, as a commander of a battalion.
utt: Kalevalatar  Please note that there were no seperate "Jewish" battalion or regiment and no segregation based on religion or some such, rather all Finnish soldiers served in their own "home" battalions and units.
utt: Kalevalatar  
utt: Kalevalatar  While many Finnish women, too, contributed by serving in a voluntary auxiliary paramilitary home guard for women called the "Lottas" (after Lotta Svärd), Finnish women of Jewish faith were not granted an entry until after the Winter War when the Lotta organization first granted membership to two Finnish ladies of Muslim faith (Tatars, another Finnish minority, who also served on the front as Finnish soldiers).
utt: Kalevalatar  Since the Lotta pledge was given in the (Lutheran) church with a promise to defend "religion, home and homeland," prejudices lingered whether the non-Christian Finns could be trusted to take the pledge.
utt: Kalevalatar  Unfortunately, I can't seem to find the number of women of Jewish faith who served in the Continuation and Lapland wars.
utt: Kalevalatar  
utt: Kalevalatar  Indeed, three Finns of the Jewish community were awarded with the German Iron Cross, but none were accepted.
utt: Kalevalatar  Captain Leo Skurnik (who as a medic saved several German lives), Captain Salomon Klass and Dina Poljakoff, a female Lotta.

utt: Kalevalatar  Films to watch:
utt: Kalevalatar  
utt: Kalevalatar  The Unknown Soldier ( Tuntematon sotilas <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048752/">1955</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090215/">the 1985 remake</a> ).
utt: Kalevalatar  
utt: Kalevalatar  Based on the highly regarded novel by Väinö Linna.
utt: Kalevalatar  Both versions are excellent and considered "a must" in Finland.

utt: Kalevalatar  
utt: Kalevalatar  Highly recommended!
utt: Kalevalatar  This is a commercial action/war film, but it also has beautiful Biblical scenes and themes interwowen in it (as hinted by the cross on display on the hero's neck in the promotinal poster).

utt: Kalevalatar  Also rather thick with a Christian message, as hinted by the title.

utt: Biblicist  Hi Kalevalatar,
utt: Biblicist  
utt: Biblicist  Thanks for posting your material - very interesting.
utt: Biblicist  Undoubtedly you have more than just a slight personal interest in Finlands history whereas someone like myself from Australia, it tends to be more academic but even so I was surprised that I came across this information as late as I have.
utt: Biblicist  
utt: Biblicist  Leaving aside the fact that Finland was fighting for its very survival; for me the situation is absolutely fascinating as it blurs the border between the supposed good side and the bad side.
utt: Biblicist  
utt: Biblicist  Even though I would have supported the Russians against the Germans in general and especially with the German attack on Stalingrad; if I were to have crossed into Finland I probably would have ended up supporting some of the German regiments which were fighting alongside Finish units against Soviet aggression toward Finland.
utt: Biblicist  Of course whenever these units moved back into Norway then these same German units would then become the enemy.
utt: Biblicist  
utt: Biblicist  Even though we are talking about human calamity and suffering, the complexities regarding Finlands involvement with Germany during this period is again a fascinating piece of history.
utt: Biblicist  
utt: Biblicist  My understanding is that the US kept a legation in Finland up until about 6 months before D-Day, do you have any information on this?
utt: Biblicist  
utt: Biblicist  Most importantly, do you have any information regarding the views that were held by the Christians during this time?

utt: Nash24  I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread, but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter.
utt: Nash24  I'm a British Pakistani, born and brought up in London, however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side.
utt: Nash24  Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan 'Don't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan', made a few years ago, yet a very interesting watch.
utt: Nash24  I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times, and have traveled throughout the country, so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it's people.
utt: Nash24  However, after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked.
utt: Nash24  I may be wrong when I say this, but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state, yet only 64 years on and I don't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with.
utt: Nash24  It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture, in a sense it boosts their superiority complex.
utt: Nash24  I actually find it shocking, that most families who moved to England in the 60's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan.
utt: Nash24  Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting, it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction- the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further.
utt: Nash24  Also whilst I'm on this topic, has anyone seen the film 'Slackistan' and what were your views?
utt: Nash24  Thank for reading my thoughts! <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>
utt: Nash24  
utt: lonely14  
utt: lonely14  So, you want to protect or retain a culture, which sanctifies the practices of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing">honour killing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_burning">bride burning</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_throwing">acid throwing</a>, the abominable practice of <a href="http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/7523/female-genital-mutilation-in-pakistan-and-beyond/">female genital mutilation</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/8967/prostitution-in-the-land-of-the-pure/">sexual abuse</a> ?
utt: lonely14  
utt: lonely14  Not to forget the tradition of <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2011/09/07/bartered-in-marriage-the-bride-exchange-in-rural-pakistan.html">Barter marriages</a>, young girls forcefully married to much older men, and some in extreme cases married to Quran itself! <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/shock.gif" alt=":shock:"/>
utt: lonely14  
utt: lonely14  One wonders why Pakistan is the <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/idINIndia-57704120110615">world's third most dangerous country for women</a> to live in?
utt: lonely14  
utt: lonely14  Yet you're worried about upper classes choosing to indulge in a bit of harmless fun? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> As a Pakistani, I welcome western influence on our culture - it might help Pakistan to become a more civilized society.
utt: lonely14  
utt: lonely14  Edit: I watched that Saira Khan's documentary you're referring to a few months ago.
utt: lonely14  I would like to know what you found so offensive?
utt: lonely14  She was sympathetic to the plight of transgender community in Pakistan - isn't that a positive thing? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>
utt: VeniViciVidi  Liberalization is moving in the OPPOSITE direction?

utt: VeniViciVidi  Personally, any nation's judiciary system that is in anyway influenced by objective morality scriptures and superstition has no place in the 21st century.
utt: VeniViciVidi  While I can understand your sentiment that is undesirable for tradition to be dismantled, ever since the fall of the wall in 1989, Liberal democratic values have spread (End of History, Fukuyama, 1992) and that does not preclude (just yet) the sovereign states whom are conformed to Islamic teachings as their rule of law.
utt: VeniViciVidi  
utt: VeniViciVidi  Western culture gives people individuality and lets them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberties they desire (as long as it doesn't harm anybody else).
utt: VeniViciVidi  I think it is the right direction that Western culture (unforced) is spreading, it gives a common ground for different cultures to interact, promotes tolerance and allows people to pick their own way of life.
utt: VeniViciVidi  I don't see that being a problem.
utt: VeniViciVidi  
utt: Nash24  
utt: Nash24  Sorry, in hindsight I really do think I should have written the post a little better.
utt: Nash24  I do not think our culture is perfect, there are many traditions that I do believe in at all and am strongly against, yet I do think that the moral values taught through culture and religion should definitely be retained.
utt: Nash24  Following your point, I think that to an extent in the 21st century we require a society based on basic morals and values, I feel that these are the foundations.
utt: Nash24  I agree with you in the sense that western culture does encourage individuality, definitely!
utt: Nash24  It has helped to shape the country, allowed women to have more rights and freedom.
utt: Nash24  I mean now in Pakistan, it is common for women to work and I totally support this.
utt: Nash24  Women should have as much right as any man.
utt: Nash24  I think the next step forward in Pakistan is adopting the western idea of equality, which is severely lacking there.
utt: oh-my-diddy  yeah unfortunate isnt it.
utt: oh-my-diddy  i think the country is deteriorating fast.
utt: oh-my-diddy  so much corruption aswell.
utt: oh-my-diddy  its no wonder they're not doing well economically.
utt: oh-my-diddy  
utt: Nash24  
utt: Nash24  It has a lot to do with the government, when the politicians are corrupt, there is little hope for the country.
utt: Nash24  What Pakistan needs is a strong leader, focused on the well-being of it's people rather than power and money.

utt: Bananaman  You're prabably expecting an emotional plea. This isn't one.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  I've read so many 9/11 conspiracy theorist threads I'm practically an expert.
utt: Bananaman  OK, I'm not not engineer or architect or pilot, which will surprise no-one who has ever had to delete one of my posts, but for God's sake, it's just reached risible levels now.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  Sooner or later every debunker reaches the stage where they just want to whack the miscreant round the head and tell him not to be stupid.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  They're faced with facts. They ignore them.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  They're faced with evidence. The evidence is lies.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  They're faced with bloody horrific in your face proof that they're wrong and they ask silly childish questions about millisecond anomolies.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  I shouldn't want to punch the nincompoops, but I do.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  So why do I still wish sense to be bashed into their silly heads?
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  Quite simply because they're pissing on the graves of those who died.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  If someone you cared about was murdered, for whatever reason, and the perpetrator was exonerated, if that's the word I want, in favour of an innocent party, I'd be pretty bloody upset.
utt: Bananaman  The same principle applies here.
utt: Bananaman  Those who died on 9/11 deserve better than to have their murderers excused as puppets, or whatever the latest fantasy they've dreamed up is.
utt: Bananaman  It's too sick.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  Well, that's it.
utt: Bananaman  That's why I no longer laugh at them.
utt: Bananaman  I prefer to spit.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  Those idiots at the memorial last week...hmmm, let's just say, I wish everyone there had just flicked the V sign at them and thrown the odd bottle of urine, just as if it was a crap band on the stage.
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  Bananaman (The pissed off)
utt: Bananaman  
utt: Bananaman  p.s.
utt: Bananaman  admittedly I did get a little emotional, but not in a good way.
utt: Myriad  As the eager easily-duped suburban kids move on to new fads and become thin on the ground and the "say anything as long as it's against Bush" contingent see increasing alternative avenues for their political disaffection, we're seeing the residue of the movement and their nature and motivations are becoming clearer.
utt: Myriad  
utt: Myriad  The anti-Semites and Nazis, we're already familiar with.
utt: Myriad  The career conspiracy exploiters and the lunatics they exploit, we're already familiar with.
utt: Myriad  But there's a significant segment of the most recent wave of Internet truther trolls that appears to be more motivated by direct sympathy for the same Islamic fundamentalist Jihadist ideals (which after cutting through the centuries-old political and religious smokescreens basically come down to "stop giving human rights to women or we lose all hope of getting laid") that motivated the 9/11 attacks in the first place.
utt: Myriad  
utt: Myriad  The Jihadists have little hope of being able to hijack any more planes so easily.
utt: Myriad  But pissing on the graves of their past victims is easily within their, or their supporters', capabilities.
utt: Myriad  I don't expect that movement to end any time soon.
utt: Myriad  
utt: Myriad  Respectfully,
utt: Myriad  Myriad
utt: liverleef  I'm fairly conservative (fiscally anyway) but I can have a rational conversation with someone who has polar opposite views.
utt: liverleef  Sometimes I even change my position a little if they present a good argument.
utt: liverleef  I'm open minded and I just don't take things as personally as others do.
utt: liverleef  
utt: liverleef  The only person that I absolutely cannot keep my cool with is a truther.
utt: liverleef  I've been asked why I'm so opposed to a second investigation.
utt: liverleef  I usually blurt out that the truth movements goal is not a second investigation, their goal is to absolve al Qaeda of the murder of thousands of innocent people and that makes me mad.
utt: liverleef  Really, really mad.
utt: liverleef  
utt: liverleef  To add to what Myriad said, I think that after the election, particularly if Obama is elected, it will be interesting to see what happens to the truth movement.
utt: liverleef  Many people fall into this group because of blind hatred of President Bush.
utt: liverleef  Most of those truthers are likely to just move on after the election and look for other things to be pissed off about.
utt: liverleef  
utt: liverleef  Thats when we are going to really have a look at the far right wing anti-government loonies, nazis, anti-semites, etc that make up the core of the truth movement.

utt: GunnerBill  I happened to watch a news review on Sky News this morning in which a bunch of journo's were bleating on that we shouldn't condemn all the "innocent" and hard working journalists at News International just because a whole bunch of hacks at the Sun were arrested...
utt: GunnerBill  because that would cause untold damage to the whole media industry.
utt: GunnerBill  
utt: GunnerBill  Oh poor them. <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>
utt: GunnerBill  
utt: GunnerBill  This is precsisely, is it not?, what the whole media has been doing to the banking industry for the last two years or so?
utt: GunnerBill  
utt: GunnerBill  Total hypocrisy. <img src="images/smilies/angry.gif"/>
utt: GunnerBill  
utt: GunnerBill  It is important to seperate the innocent from the guilty in both industries but it's ironic that the papers have been selling copy by basically tarring all bankers with the same brush and slagging them off mercilessly for years.
utt: ak137  Isnt Sky News owned by BSkyB which is owned by News international or something?
utt: ak137  It doesnt surprise me though, lets hope Murdoch goes down.
utt: Organ  Why would they not be sympathetic to people whom are essentially their own colleagues?
utt: Existentialistic  The media condemning bankers is akin to a witch hunt, Stephen Hester was given just a £6.5M bonus in 2010 yet JPMorgan's top executive was paid $21M that year.
utt: Existentialistic  Stephen Hester was employed because of his excellent show of skills after his success in safely defusing the explosive capital-market business of Abbey National.
utt: Existentialistic  The media seem to have mixed up the man responsible for the merge with ABN Amro with the man responsible for fixing the failure of RBS.
utt: Existentialistic  
utt: Existentialistic  Moral of the story: the media will always present news in a way which forwards their views, it's that simple.

utt: JoanneDorel  What I want to know is what do you really have against Jesse.
utt: JoanneDorel  I know him personally, I have marhed with him, and have worked for him.
utt: JoanneDorel  My favorite march with Jesse was the one from the chicken processing plant in N.
utt: JoanneDorel  Carolina where 120 women died in a fire because the owners locked the emergency exit so no one could sneak outside for a break.
utt: JoanneDorel  Wher the women even those pregnant were not allowed any breaks except a 30 minute lunch perid.
utt: JoanneDorel  We walked from the factory to the State Capitol in an effort to get the owners to provide some financial support to the children and families of the women who died.
utt: JoanneDorel  What is so wrong with that do to Jesse's efforts some benefits were paid by the company and the state relented and released some money too.
utt: BillW  george, you just fully described me.
utt: BillW  As low a person as you think I am, I am really OK.
utt: BillW  I live, I breath, I love, I bleed red blood and I am one of those whose "worst qualities of an age and much of a generation notable mostly for its narcism and self-indulgence.
utt: BillW  The irony of wistful recollections of past protest adventures clothed as they were in a style and form so like their own caricatures of the "reactionary" forces they opposed" and yet I fought on the ground in Viet Nam.
utt: BillW  
utt: BillW  You know what - we were possibly over there at the same time, and I called and was a grateful receiver of many an air strick we called in.
utt: BillW  You may have been one of the bombers, I was one of those grunts on the other side of the "red smoke".
utt: BillW  Do you realize I was 1 1/2 clicks from a full blown B-52 strike.
utt: BillW  The B-52s were 6 miles away.
utt: BillW  You have no idea how scary it is for the bombs to be walking toward you and you only realized they were going to miss you as they went away.
utt: BillW  Yes, I was there and I was also one of "THEM" - before I went, while I was there and after I got back!
utt: BillW  
utt: BillW  Herbert Spencer addresses this issue directly, "There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance--that principle is contempt prior to investigation."
utt: BillW  
utt: BillW  But, for this I forgive you because God already has!
utt: edgarblythe  Joanne, the reason I have refused to argue about Jesse is because his detractors are too irrational about it.
utt: edgarblythe  They all parrot identical words and phrases like they all memorized the same little pamphlet.
utt: edgarblythe  As soon as you say anything in his defense they morph into "Jesse and Al sharpton".
utt: edgarblythe  Any more and it's suddenly "Jesse and Al sharpton and farakhan".
utt: edgarblythe  Endless name calling and nothing gets resolved.
utt: mikey  Georgeob1....I sat on the curbstone with my friends as they shed their tears, the rough tough macho guys, as I'm sure we all did, and listened to them pour their hearts out, 'if they came home alive', the guys that were "lucky" to come back, and not in a body bag, ball less, legless, armless, footless.
utt: mikey  or in a wheelchair forever.
utt: mikey  And for what? You tell me.
utt: mikey  
utt: mikey  This country has lost sight of itself.
utt: edgarblythe  I stand by my assessment of Nixon and Cambodia.
utt: edgarblythe  I stand by everything I have said on this thread.
utt: edgarblythe  I consider that the Peace Movement and the Civil Rights Movement in conjunction embodied most of the more noble attributes of human striving, in that or any age.
utt: BillW  george, I wanted to add one very important thing, I go a lot with gut feeling - it's my way.
utt: BillW  I feel you are a good man, I truly like you.
utt: BillW  One person's higher morals - another person sees as a fault.
utt: BillW  In the end we are all the same and we return to worm food!
utt: JoanneDorel  I think the guys that fled to Canada were heros too.
utt: JoanneDorel  They gave up the comforts of home and being surrounded by friends and family let alone there status as wanted criminals.
utt: JoanneDorel  
utt: JoanneDorel  Everyone made choices in that horrible war, we all wre affected.
utt: JoanneDorel  No one experience is more than any other.
utt: BillW  It sent society into shambles - it was the destroyer of families, friendships and politics today are the result of the chasm.
utt: BillW  I have live my life on these issue, it is my pariah and and it is my saviour.
utt: BillW  Unfortunately, today it is coming back to haunt us.
utt: BillW  If GWB continues his course he will never be forgiven.
utt: BillW  Are there no lessons learned!
utt: edgarblythe  You are right BillW

utt: Pale Rider  The U.S.
utt: Pale Rider  Department of Justice seal bears a Latin phrase: "Qui Pro Domina Justitia Sequitur." The motto refers to the attorney general, "who prosecutes on behalf of Lady Justice." But under President Barack Obama's politically corrupt DOJ, Lady Justice is getting the shaft.
utt: Pale Rider  
utt: Pale Rider  To wit: Let's examine the uproar over Attorney General Eric Holder's decision to protect hate-mongering thugs who harassed and bullied precinct workers and voters on Election Day in Philadelphia.
utt: Pale Rider  Oh, wait.
utt: Pale Rider  There's been no uproar.
utt: Pale Rider  Let me tell you why.
utt: Pale Rider  
utt: Pale Rider  Two weeks ago, in a highly unusual move, Holder dismissed default judgments his department had won against two of three defendants charged with violating the Voting Rights Act.
utt: Pale Rider  On Nov. 4, 2008, a billy club-wielding militant in military-style boots and beret stood outside a Philly polling location with a similarly dressed partner.

utt: MarcATL  Obama has pulled the country back from the brink of disaster that Bush'n'Cheney had left it in.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  He's created ObamaCare, because, as we all know, Obama cares.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  He's brought dignity back to the Office.

utt: MarcATL  The economy has been steadily ticking up.
utt: MarcATL

utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  He got Bin Laden from a place that Bush didn't dare to go into.
utt: MarcATL  Khaddaffi's gone.
utt: MarcATL  Pirates of the seas know they can't 'EFF around with Americans or any of their properties.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  He helped to liberate a country from a tyrant w/o spending too much time, money and with no casualties.
utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  The rest of the world knows the same.

utt: MarcATL  
utt: MarcATL  He's pulling us out of war.

utt: Oldstyle  
utt: Oldstyle  I guess if you ignore the fact that he can't submit budgets...is the first American President to have our credit rating downgraded...ran up more debt in a shorter amount of time than anyone in history...has a "signature" piece of legislation, ObamaCare, that not only doesn't lower health care cost but is probably the most badly written law ever and will be ruled unconstitutional...appointed the same man who got Marc Rich off for a lump sum payment to the Clintons as his Attorney General...appointed a man who couldn't figure out TurboTax as our Treasury Secretary...fast tracked Solyndra and made it the "showcase" of his green jobs initiative...spent a trillion dollars on his "stimulus" only to see unemployment go from 8% to over 10...stonewalled drilling permits in the Gulf and the oil pipeline to placate his environmental base while throwing tens of thousands of jobless Americans under the bus...gave us expensive programs like Cash for Clunkers that ate up billions of taxpayer dollars and didn't jumpstart the economy...has deteriorated our relationship with Israel to it's worst state ever while he tried to "reason" with Iran...has no coherent energy policy...no coherent housing policy...no coherent trade policy...has shown absolutely no ability to forge a bipartisan approach to governing...and has spent the majority of his time campaigning for a second term rather than doing the actual job of President.
utt: Oldstyle  Other than all that...he's just great, Marc!!!

utt: nmds  -- 4th January 1932 --
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  80 years ago today India’s National Congress, the largest and most powerful force in the movement for Indian self-rule, was declared illegal by the British government and its leader, Gandhi, was arrested in Bombay.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  And generally this is considered by all moderns a Very Bad Thing.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  15 years later the Imperial powers finally assented to Gandhi’s idea, common to average Englishmen and Indians alike, that India belonged to the Indians, and in 1947 India was granted formal independence from rule by the British government.
utt: nmds  Other nationalist movements were succeeding and seceding throughout Asia and Africa at around the same time.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  And generally this is considered by all moderns a Very Good Thing.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  But immediately that African and Asian peoples were permitted to enjoy freedom from colonisation by Europeans and self-determination, equivalent privileges were withdrawn from the European peoples.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  An invasion of Europe began that would soon dwarf any colonisation by Europeans of Africa and Asia; governmental powers began to be transferred to a foreign bureaucracy in Brussels and Strasbourg; and all estates of the government plus the increasingly powerful fourth estate began a process of deconstructing culturally and psychologically the peoples of Europe as such.
utt: nmds  There can be no bothersome self-determination when the self no longer admits of its own existence.
utt: nmds  India might belong to the Indians, but henceforth, if not already, England would not belong to the English, nor Germany to the Germans, etc.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  Naturally the normal people of Europe were opposed to all this, but their wishes were ignored.
utt: nmds  Anytime the restless natives of Europe looked like mounting a serious democratic challenge to the new old imperialists, the political vehicle in question was made illegal by its ‘democratic’ ‘anti-fascist’ rival in power.
utt: nmds  Most recently Britain’s BNP was dragged through the courts and made to change its constitution and disavow it’s reason for being -- where it had previously been explicitly concerned with protecting the native peoples of Britain, it now had to prove its concern with protecting the native peoples of every other country on earth from its own members and supporters.
utt: nmds  You will see why I began by remembering the Regime’s illegalisation of the Indian National Congress.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  And generally these anti-European double standards are considered by all TSRers a Very Good Thing.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  Or are they? (By which I mean ‘Discuss.’)
utt: nmds  
utt: Ravin McRaven  
utt: Ravin McRaven  South Africa, namibia, USA, australia, canada, argentina, brazil, new zealand ?- nope, no europeans there, are there.
utt: Ravin McRaven  And of course you would never see europeans in india, kenya, hong kong, Abu dhabi, sri lanka, fiji, malaysia, thailand etc etc.
utt: Ravin McRaven  No of course not, they are all arressted and deported back to Dover on a daily basis
utt: whyumadtho  nmds, a 'nation', as you're using it, has no 'separate or politically independent territory', according to your sacrosanct OED.
utt: whyumadtho  No nation has prerogative over a space.
utt: whyumadtho  
utt: whyumadtho  Try again.
utt: whyumadtho  
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  I don't understand -- I consider the Indians, the Jews, and the Tswana to be nations -- and they appear to possess separate or politically independent territories' devoted to their interests, namely India, Israel and Botswana -- out of which they booted us.
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  In general I would say any people anywhere is entitled at any time to declare itself sovereign and independent.
utt: nmds  I'm surprised to find you disagree.
utt: nmds  What else is slavery but the denial of a right to secede and be independent?
utt: nmds  
utt: nmds  [Thanks for actually responding to what I wrote though.
utt: nmds  Makes a nice ****ing change for you!]

utt: Repatriated Canuck  What the hell is going on with aboriginals around the planet.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  I've just come home from a long stint in Australia thinking that aboriginals back in Canada are far better off (relatively speaking) and now we have the Red Cross out at Attawapiskat community.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  In Australia you know straight away the difference as soon as you arrive in an aboriginal community.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  They are run down garbage everywhere with people just sitting about doing nothing.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  In Canada it seems no better.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Here in Yellowknife there is a reservation by the old town and you don't need to see the teepee to know you've crossed some kind of border.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  In an instant the houses viewed have not received a coat of paint in years.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Broken down cars and skidoos litter yards and unlike the neighborhood 10 metres away they have cut down almost every tree.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Whatever happened to being in tune with nature?
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Addictions and sexual abuse run high.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Communities in Canada and Australia outright ban alcohol in a vain effort to stem problems.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Jails are filled with them and the life expectancy is much lower than the rest of both countries.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  I'm getting tired of seeing it and wondering what can be done.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  The bleeding heart efforts have done nothing but bred a generation of people who refuse to work and blame everyone for their issues.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  A glaring example is the death of a small child in Australia who was electrocuted inside a wall.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  The family then blamed the government for the dilapidated condition of the house.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  I'm sure the house came with a child sized hole kicked in already.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  At the same time other communities are left without proper infrastructure like Attawapiskat but as I just learnt on the news they have been allocated 80 million since 2006.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Where did all the bloody money go?
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  I'm wondering if it's time to give these tiny outpost communities some hard choices.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Either live out bush like your ancestors and be done with it or move closer to larger settlements.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  These communities are disgusting and a drain on the rest of us.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  There seems no hope in these areas.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Suicide rates are sky high indicting desperation and sadness.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  So if the kids don't kill themselves they end up in jail and it's every ones fault other than their own.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  I do understand some of the hardships in recent memory that need to overcome such as the stolen generation and residential schools.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  This sympathy only stretches a finite amount though.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Any ideas on what should be done because we are going nowhere and things that are being tried only breed resentment and anger.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  An example there is fishing rights then natives trying to sell caught fish for profit.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Or the reverse racist laws that have kept me out of my field of work for five months because I'm the wrong colour.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  The kicker there is that my family is close to getting our status back and even then I am the wrong type of indian....
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Of course ticking that aboriginal box gives me an unfair advantage over someone who is more qualified.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  It would be hard not to use that which leads me to feel it should be abolished as well.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  My missus dislikes my hard heart attitude but I can draw so many parallels with Africa it's not good.
utt: Repatriated Canuck  Is there some sort of middle ground?
utt: Repatriated Canuck  
utt: Repatriated Canuck  I don't like seeing people suffer and something needs to change but how can we go about forcing it?
utt: Repatriated Canuck  For many of the youth of these communities it's past breaking point.
utt: Aussiegunner  I agree that people in Aboriginal communities need to help themselves if they are going to have a decent standard of living and helping themselves usually involves leaving the dust bowls where they live for somewhere where there is economic opportunity.
utt: Aussiegunner  Many from Aboriginal communities know that as well,they are usually the ones who have left.
utt: Aussiegunner  Unfortunately white people lecturing them on this won't change their minds, it just pisses them off.
utt: Aussiegunner  
utt: Aussiegunner  All we can do is to protect the children as well as we can with law enforcement, health care and adequate housing, and to provide the educational opportunities for those who want to do better to do so, so that they can work out for themselves that the should leave.
utt: Aussiegunner  If the rest of them want to live miserable squalid lives, despite the efforts of the broader Australian and Canadian communities to make amens for the wrongs of the past by providing all they need to take the opportunity for a better life, then we can all go to sleep at night with a clear concience.
utt: Aussiegunner  I know I do.

utt: izzoh  Hi All,
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  I love my parents to pieces.
utt: izzoh  To cut a long story short, my dad had cancer - given 6 weeks to live.
utt: izzoh  My mum gave up work to look after him. 15 years later, my dad is in remission (thank goodness) back at work and my mum is now staying at home and being looked after.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  Ever since I started working I have helped out.
utt: izzoh  As I feel a child should when they become an adult and start working.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  But recently it seems to have got out of control and I almost feel like I am now the parent.
utt: izzoh  A part of me feels as though I have to make it up to my parents.
utt: izzoh  The life they could have had if my dad never became ill.
utt: izzoh  He could not work for 10 years due to how bad his body suffered.
utt: izzoh  He was alos diagnosed with a brain tumour throughout that time and survived and I am so prud of him for going back to work and for being so inspirational, and the same goes for my mum.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  Anyway, I earn more then my dad by about £600 a month.
utt: izzoh  My mum gets working tax credits, about £35 a week.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  My boyfriend who is studying at uni also lives with us.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  The problem I have is that I feel as though I am paying for everything now, I always felt like I had to spoil my parents, feeling so lucky to still have them and I would do anything for them but now I am financially struggling and I think they believe my money is endless.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  I was in sever debt which through hard work I am getting out of.
utt: izzoh  I am still in debt by about £24k.
utt: izzoh  One is a loan, the other is an overdraft and one is a credit card.
utt: izzoh  This I am managing -just about.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  I took out the loan about a year ago.
utt: izzoh  I had worked hard on keeping my bank account in good order and even managed to save £800!
utt: izzoh  first time ever!
utt: izzoh  The loan was originally to combine other debt and buy a new car.
utt: izzoh  But then I saw that my mum was struggling.
utt: izzoh  She has credit cards which my dad didnt know about and it would have caused worldwar 3.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  So I paid them off for her.
utt: izzoh  Silly me I didnt total how much but it was about 4 debts in total and I am sure it must have been about 5k in total.
utt: izzoh  It was on the agreement that my mum would give me £85 a month which was half of what she was paying the creditors.
utt: izzoh  It also stopped teh calls, letters and my mum is much more relaxed now.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  But she seems to have forgotten HOW much I paid off as she keeps hinting that she will stop giving me the money in December.
utt: izzoh  That means she has only paid me about 9 times!
utt: izzoh  She is adament it wasnt that much and I am going to try and ask my bank for a backdated statement so I can see exactly what I have paid out.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  Also, she is getting quite demanding.
utt: izzoh  I already pay the council tax, internet (which she is on 80% of the day), phone line, phone calls, sky tv and tv license.
utt: izzoh  I also pay for teh gas and electric and buy the main food shop per month. (£200 in total roughly).
utt: izzoh  I also try and do things like by mu mum and dad shoes etc, it sounds silly but they dont do it and my mum literally ends up with holes in her leggings.
utt: izzoh  She would rather by food and I understand this as she has been brought up that spoiling yourself is done via food.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  I also had to use my savings to buy a wshing machine when it broke down.
utt: izzoh  I also had to buy a new tv for the house as our old one we had for 17 years and broke.
utt: izzoh  I had to pay for curtains because our flat is old, on a corner and freezing.
utt: izzoh  I had to buy carpets because we had bare concrete floors.
utt: izzoh  I dont understand where my parents money goes!
utt: izzoh  I know they are not saving and I just cant understand!
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  Now my mum is almost taking advantage, she keep going on about our cooker which is almost on its way out and I had to keep saying I can not afford it, because I really can not right now.
utt: izzoh  She went on so much that I said I would get a ew on in February.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  I am also supporting my boyfriend at the moment and I maintain a car because I need it for work.
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  I just feel like she does not understand that I am almost supporting everyone right now.
utt: izzoh  I am 25 and I am worried then if I ever move out they will be completely lost!
utt: izzoh  She is so sensitive that even if I don;t eat dinner she gets in a mood and takes it personally!
utt: izzoh  
utt: izzoh  I am sorry guys.....
utt: izzoh  this is just a rant really!
utt: izzoh  I just feel like I am already tied down with kids!
utt: BitterAndTwisted  STOP BUYING THINGS FOR THEIR HOME!
utt: BitterAndTwisted  You can't afford it, not with £24k of debt round your neck!
utt: BitterAndTwisted  
utt: BitterAndTwisted  "council tax, internet, phone line, phone calls, sky tv and tv license.
utt: BitterAndTwisted  I also pay for the gas and electric and buy the main food shop per month. (£200 in total roughly)" How much does this come to a month?
utt: BitterAndTwisted  
utt: BitterAndTwisted  If you're paying nearly all of the running-costs of your parents' home and they're paying the rent/mortgage where is all the rest of their money going?
utt: BitterAndTwisted  Mum's racked up even more debts, I suspect.

utt: Synthaholic  If you are not already rich, becoming Senator can/will lead to riches, but the Senate is a stepping stone to the presidency if you are a very, very rich person with political ambition.
utt: Synthaholic  Jeb is no dummy.
utt: Synthaholic  He knows that America won't elect another Bush as President.
utt: Synthaholic  So why would he ever want to deal with any of that nonsense, moving to Washington from Miami, dealing with the little people voters, taking a MASSIVE pay cut...

utt: The Shrike  It's the way he coached and ran that team as a family.
utt: The Shrike  Very few programs achieve that level of big-time football success with such a high level of academic success.
utt: The Shrike  Skip class?
utt: The Shrike  You're benched.
utt: The Shrike  Fail a class?
utt: The Shrike  Benched, or off the team.
utt: The Shrike  Want your name on your jersey?
utt: The Shrike  Go somewhere else; we're a team.
utt: The Shrike  The whole "We are Penn State" thing came from an incident in which the team was set to play in the segregated South and one or more of their African American players were taking heat.
utt: The Shrike  The team's response was that all of them, black and white, were integral to that team identity.
utt: The Shrike  It was a gutsy show of solidarity against institutionalized racism.
utt: The Shrike  
utt: The Shrike  Through the years, Joe could've made tons more money.
utt: The Shrike  He could've recruited better athletes and won more championships.
utt: The Shrike  But he had a love of that community - to which he's donated millions - and a dedication to honor first, and winning second.
utt: The Shrike  
utt: The Shrike  That's why it's so painful now to learn that in this critical instance Joe's moral compass sent him to the Bermuda Triangle.
utt: The Shrike  He really is a superb human being, but in this case he flat out failed to live up to anything near his own code of honor.
utt: The Shrike  That's the tragic irony and the cognitive dissonance here.
utt: The Shrike  
utt: bigred  Well said, thanks.
utt: bigred  He is certainly not faultless here and he knows and has said as much; his punishment is far more than a sad ending to an unmatched and otherwise extremely honorable career.
utt: bigred  It's living with knowing he could have done more.
utt: Darat  I would examine the evidence available and then make my mind up.
utt: Darat  If I thought a member of my family or circle of friends had responded as was described in the Grand Jury paper I would be more angry than I would on learning of a similar set of circumstances involving a work colleague.
utt: Darat  
utt: bigred  Good idea, although I'm betting initially you would assume innocence and need one heckuva a case and a LOT of evidence to be swayed otherwise.
utt: bigred  And there is little evidence in this right now.
utt: bigred  There are accusations and testimonials only.
utt: bigred  Strong stuff but IMO not nearly enough to *BANG* stop or I'll shoot.
utt: bigred  
utt: bigred  I just think it would have been nice/advisable to have this go to court and KNOW what's what before people started throwing molotov cocktails every which way.
utt: bigred  Well said, thanks.
utt: bigred  He is certainly not faultless here and he knows and has said as much; his punishment is far more than a sad ending to an unmatched and otherwise extremely honorable career.
utt: bigred  It's living with knowing he could have done more.
utt: bigred  
utt: Darat  He has been in a position of knowing he could have done more for the last (around) 10 years so I don't see why it should now start being a punishment?
utt: Resume  I'm not sure, but to me a superb human being might be moved to get off his ass and go investigate when it's reported that one of his staff
utt: Resume  
utt: bigred  Sandusky was not one of this staff.
utt: bigred  
utt: bigred  oops, sorry, I threw another fact in there.
utt: bigred  I keep forgetting they don't matter in this issue.
utt: bigred  Sandusky was not one of this staff.
utt: bigred  
utt: bigred  oops, sorry, I threw another fact in there.
utt: bigred  I keep forgetting they don't matter in this issue.
utt: bigred  
utt: tyr_13  An irrelevant fact.
utt: Tsukasa Buddha  ...snip...
utt: Tsukasa Buddha  
utt: Tsukasa Buddha  I agree.
utt: Tsukasa Buddha  My problem hasn't been with any of this, but the way people have been acting like his failing was some unthinkably extreme character deficiency.
utt: Tsukasa Buddha  My real position is that human nature is horrible, from our rational moral principle perspective.
utt: Tsukasa Buddha  This man's character is no more scummy than one's neighbour, who honestly is probably sitting on a similar story about Uncle Joe.
utt: Tsukasa Buddha  And by "no more" I mean just as scummy, just under the right bizarre influences.
utt: Tsukasa Buddha  
utt: Tsukasa Buddha  ...snip...
utt: Tsukasa Buddha  
utt: Darat  That's the point I was making earlier when I said I could understand why he did not take immediate action when he saw the child being raped and I accept that is how humans can react in such stressful circumstances.
utt: Darat  
utt: Darat  But that only covers the immediate reaction, from what others have posted it seems that for years after witnessing the child being raped he would have seen the rapist with young children.
utt: Darat  Given that I do think it is right to conclude that to not have taken further action over that timespan is a character flaw.
utt: AlBell  Wow. What caliber weapons do you folks carry?
utt: AlBell  
utt: bigred  On the internet, everone is Bruce Lee with an uzi. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>
utt: bigred  
utt: bigred  It is soooo easy to sit here all comfy behind a computer with the luxury of hindsight and chit chatter away about I woulda done the exact right thing at the exact right time blah blah blah.
utt: bigred  But when something this shocking blindsides you in an instant, FYI it might not be so easy/simple and being human you might not take the best path.
utt: bigred  
utt: bigred  I do not excuse anyone in this situation who didn't, btw.
utt: bigred  Just something to think about.

utt: Martyn*  Well, the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seems to think so, and round about now many people in this country would go along with him on that one.
utt: Martyn*  
utt: Martyn*  But I do not think our government is the only "evil" government.
utt: Martyn*  The U.S.
utt: Martyn*  government is certainly a close runner-up, if not first place!
utt: Martyn*  I am of course referring to America, the Federal Reserve and the banking cartel Oligarchs.
utt: Martyn*  There is certainly an "evil" elitism going on in the world right now.
utt: Martyn*  Rome has an elite.
utt: Martyn*  It is called the Vatican.
utt: Martyn*  We have the Tory party <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/p.gif" alt=":p:"/>
utt: Martyn*  
utt: Martyn*  But was the Ayatollah right?
utt: Martyn*  
utt: Martyn*  Is our government the most "evil" in the world?
utt: Martyn*  
utt: Martyn*  Our government seems to put banks, big business and capitalism before the needs of the people (assuming that they do not need rampant capitalism and huge superstores).
utt: Martyn*  We bailed out the elite bankers with tax payers money and now the big businesses are sacking folk.
utt: Martyn*  
utt: Martyn*  We (not I) work for a ruling elite.
utt: Martyn*  We are, some would say, slaves on our own land.
utt: Martyn*  Although slaves don't get a wage, we are payed a pittance for hard work.
utt: Martyn*  Now they want us to work for free!!
utt: Martyn*  
utt: Martyn*  We were taken to war with an imaginary foe.
utt: Martyn*  It was merely for America's need for oil.
utt: Martyn*  There were no WMDs, and the government duped the people into believing that U.S.
utt: Martyn*  style democracy would be good for the Middle East.
utt: Martyn*  We tortured our prisoners of war.
utt: Martyn*  We shut up and shut out those who dared to speak out.
utt: Martyn*  We consored and we covered over, and sexed up the truth.
utt: Martyn*  Our government no longer listens to the people they were elected by.
utt: Martyn*  Our government is more concerned with international affairs; trying to sort out the affairs of other countries whilst leaving our own to rot away.
utt: Martyn*  Our people are lost for want of leadership.
utt: Martyn*  Our children are laid waste and desolate. (Sorry if I sound like Isaiah here).
utt: Martyn*  
utt: Martyn*  The government have brought in more than a hundred laws since the terrorist attacks.
utt: Martyn*  The issue over who caused the 9/11 attacks will always prompt conspiracy theorists to speculate that the U.S.
utt: Martyn*  government was behind it all to shore up American solidarity in their "war on oil" with the Middle East.
utt: Martyn*  
utt: Martyn*  Are we the "evil" ones here?
utt: Martyn*  I sometimes wonder.
utt: Martyn*  Then there is the EU.
utt: Martyn*  Now, there's a candidate for "evil" if there ever was one!
utt: Martyn*  Nation shall rise against nation, as the saying goes.
utt: Martyn*  
utt: Martyn*  Aren't we now in a culture war, a religious war, an economic war, a social war, an internal war, a political war?
utt: Martyn*  
utt: Martyn*  When you look at it we are at war right now, and many of us do not know.
utt: Martyn*  This war is unlike any gone before.
utt: Martyn*  
utt: Martyn*  Was the Ayatollah right?
utt: Martyn*  
utt: Martyn*  No Poll included.

utt: Elipsis  It's like calling a parent that slaps their child the worst parent in the world when there are parents who have tortured, starved and raped their children.
utt: Elipsis  The fact of the matter is our government was dubbed the most evil in the world when there are over 100 countries that are worse, therefore making the statement stupid.

utt: Aeolus  Sorry fast coach!
utt: Aeolus  
utt: Aeolus  I thought you were arguing that through other governments being more evil, ours can justify being evil, while staying less evil than the other evil governments who may commit crimes more evil and accidently a whole human rights.
utt: Joluk  How on earth is calling our government the most 'evil' in the world justified?, we've hardly said anything about the election results and deliberately kept fairly quiet over it.
utt: Joluk  If i was David Miliband i'd criticise him back, make a statement calling him an unelected fascist dictator and denounce the deaths of protestors as 'barbaric', then withdraw all British diplomats.

utt: Christina86  so looks like i am thinking too much this morning.
utt: Christina86  i am afraid of something happening to me or baby during labor.
utt: Christina86  really afraid.
utt: Christina86  i had a good cry about it.
utt: Christina86  
utt: Christina86  i am so scared that somehting will happen and i will have to come home without baby.
utt: Christina86  that she will pass away.
utt: Christina86  dh fear is i will pass away.
utt: Christina86  amd loose both of us.
utt: Christina86  
utt: Christina86  are these fears normal?
utt: Christina86  should we be talking to someone about this?
utt: Christina86  
utt: Christina86  so far pregnancy has been normal, everythign has been.
utt: Christina86  so medical wise there is nothing that would make the dr think that there will be problems.
utt: Christina86  other then looks like we may need an induction, but dr.
utt: Christina86  reassured us that, it is very normal for first time moms go over due dates and need inductions.
utt: Christina86  and we are going to be in a hospital with a good nicu unit, so i know if something does happen at the lst min there will be lots of good dr.s and nurses around.
utt: Christina86  
utt: Christina86  i think the fear hit us so hard cause we are near the end.
utt: Christina86  
utt: Christina86  did anyone else have these fears?
utt: Christina86  how did you get over them?
utt: Christina86  advice please!
utt: JenniferinCo  I was terrified all the way to the hospital after my water broke.
utt: JenniferinCo  Terrified that something had happened since imstopped feeling her move.
utt: JenniferinCo  And at the hospital, it seemed tomtake forever for them tomfind her on The fetal monitor; l was so scared!
utt: JenniferinCo  And I was terrified all the way to surgery that something would go wrong and she would die in surgery.
utt: JenniferinCo  
utt: JenniferinCo  So, you aren't alone!
utt: JenniferinCo  I think it's natural.
utt: JenniferinCo  I just tried to breath deeply through all of my fears to help.
utt: SarahSH  I'm right there with you.
utt: SarahSH  I'm terrified, and DH doesn't talk about it much but he's nervous too.
utt: SarahSH  
utt: SarahSH  I'm the kind of person who likes statistics and hard facts, so this made me feel a bit better:
utt: SarahSH  
utt: SarahSH  "The reported maternal mortality ratio in Canada has declined from approximately 500 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in the early 1920s to less than 5 per 100,000 live births in the 1990s1, among the lowest reported maternal mortality ratios in the world."
utt: SarahSH  from:
utt: SarahSH  
utt: SarahSH  and,
utt: SarahSH  
utt: SarahSH  "Since 1991, stillbirth (fetal death) rates in Canada have been fluctuating around 6.0 per 1,000 births.
utt: SarahSH  In 2004, the fetal death rate was 6.1 per 1,000 births [0.6%], representing a decrease of 0.3 from the year before.
utt: SarahSH  Late stillbirth rates (fetal deaths with 28 or more weeks of gestation) have dropped steadily in the past quarter of century, from 3.5 in 1991 to 2.9 in 2004 [0.3%]."
utt: SarahSH  from:
utt: SarahSH  
utt: SarahSH  These statistics include premature births and crack-addict mothers/women with other serious health problems.
utt: SarahSH  So the chances of anything going all that wrong with your delivery are really, really, really slim.

utt: Quatermass  RetiredGySgt, in a rather lazy fashion repeatedly points to The National Security Archive 's collection of 77 documents on the atomic bomb and end of world war 2 saying 'the proof is in there'.
utt: Quatermass  Rather like tossing a dictionary at a newspaper editor and saying 'here's tomorrow's front page story'.
utt: Quatermass  
utt: Quatermass  So where in the comprehensive 77 lengthy sections could that magical, much sought-after golden fleece-like 'good reason' to consign the 350,000 civilian population of Hiroshima and the 250.000 civilian population of Nagasaki to the horrors of a nuclear blood bath be hiding?
utt: Quatermass  
utt: Quatermass  Perhaps it was Document 29, where on 11 of July Foreign Minister Togo sent the following 'extremely urgent' message to Ambassador Sato:
utt: Quatermass  
utt: Quatermass  "We are now secretly giving consideration to the termination of the war because of the pressing situation which confronts Japan both at home and abroad Therefore, when you have your interview with Molotov [ in accordance with previous instructions] you should not confine yourself to the objective of a rapprochement between Russia and Japan but should also sound him out on the extent to which it is possible to make use of Russia in ending the war."
utt: Quatermass  
utt: Quatermass  and then on the same day:
utt: Quatermass  
utt: Quatermass  "..
utt: Quatermass  Japan- as a proposal for ending the war and because of her concern for the establishment and maintenance of lasting peace - has absolutely no idea of annexing or holding the territories which she occupied during the war."
utt: Quatermass  
utt: Quatermass  
utt: Quatermass  These Documents reveal many desperate attempts by Japans envoys to establish a surrender up to the very end and on August 5th (Document 52).
utt: Quatermass  All the while U.S.
utt: Quatermass  interceptors secretly listened in, and made Truman's office aware of the full content of these Japanese attempts yet they went ahead anyway, choosing to test one of each type of their new atomic devices, first Uranium, then Plutonium on the living Human guinea pigs; the old men, the helpless women and innocent children behind enemy lines, away from the theatre of war, away from where the soldiers were.
utt: Quatermass  America sneaked in, from a safe height and in cowards fashion dropped their devastating bombs on non combatants then ran away.
utt: Quatermass  
utt: Quatermass  And as President Harry Truman ate his lunch on the Augusta with fellow mass murderers Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, news of the bombing of Hiroshima came in.
utt: Quatermass  Jubilantly, he announced to the retinue of sailors around him..
utt: Quatermass  
utt: Quatermass  "This is the Greatest thing in History!"
utt: Quatermass  
utt: Quatermass  <img src="http://cemeterypiss.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/hiroshima_and_nagasaki_victims_.jpg"/>
utt: Quatermass  (Heaped bodies after Hiroshima atomic-bombing of civilian area.)
utt: Quatermass  
utt: Madeline  
utt: Madeline  It has always bothered me that we bombed cities full of non-whites, but not Germany, where the Death Camps existed.
utt: Madeline  Maybe the A-Bomb was not finished before VE Day.
utt: Madeline  Maybe.
utt: Madeline  
utt: Madeline  But the US confined Japanaese Americans to internment camps and did NOT do so as to Italian Americans or German Americans.
utt: Madeline  
utt: Madeline  It seems to me there must have been a tremendous temptation to drop the A-Bomb SOMEPLACE, just to show the world what we had.
utt: Madeline  Without using it in warfare, who would ever believe this gruesome weapon even existed?
utt: Madeline  
utt: Madeline  All these things, together with the second bombing, have made me uneasy.
utt: Madeline  I WANT to believe Truman's decisions were ethically defensible.
utt: Madeline  His comments to those around him do not offend me.
utt: Madeline  It's understandable that he wanted VJ Day at any cost.
utt: Madeline  
utt: Madeline  But still the doubts persist -- that we bombed a couple of Asian cities and killed millions, instantly or later by radiation poisoning, because we COULD and not because we had no other choice.
utt: Madeline  
utt: Madeline  I don't know what my Daddy saw or knew.
utt: Madeline  I lost him when I was quite young, and like most WW II vets, he would never discuss what he'd been through.
utt: Madeline  But my Mommy and Daddy were pinkos.
utt: Madeline  They sympathesized with or actually joined the American Communist Party.
utt: Madeline  I rather think if he'd been all good with Truman's decisions, Daddy would not have been such a radical after the war.
utt: Madeline  
utt: namvet  
utt: namvet  waste of time on that asshat.
utt: Madeline  Quartermass has not given opinion in that last post, namvet.
utt: Madeline  He recited facts.
utt: Madeline  Either he has the facts right or he doesn't.
utt: Madeline  
utt: Madeline  If he's right, what use is it to go on pretending it was all good?
utt: Madeline  Quartermass has not given opinion in that last post, namvet.
utt: Madeline  He recited facts.
utt: Madeline  Either he has the facts right or he doesn't.
utt: Madeline  
utt: Madeline  If he's right, what use is it to go on pretending it was all good?
utt: Madeline  
utt: namvet  
utt: namvet  that's the point.
utt: namvet  no reply to back up what he says.
utt: namvet  he's using the ole copy and paste trick.
utt: namvet  
utt: namvet  <quote>
utt: namvet  And as President Harry Truman ate his lunch on the Augusta with fellow mass murderers Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, news of the bombing of Hiroshima came in.

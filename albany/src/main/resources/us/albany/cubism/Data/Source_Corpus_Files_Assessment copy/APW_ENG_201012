Oprah Winfrey and author Jonathan Franzen have put their rocky past behind them.
</P>
<P>
Franzen appeared on Monday's episode of the "The Oprah Winfrey Show," embracing Winfrey after she chose his bestselling novel "Freedom" for her popular book club in September. The appearance came nine years after Franzen called some of Winfrey's book club picks "schmaltzy" when she chose his previous book "The Corrections." At the time, Franzen apologized quickly and repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
On Monday's show the two embraced. Winfrey told Franzen "it's an honor to have you here." Franzen responded that "it's an honor to be here." The two talked about his writing process and the author's visit with President Barack Obama. When she chose "Freedom" for Oprah's Book Club, Winfrey called it a "masterpiece."

Annie Lennox honored by queen for charity work
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON 2010-12-31 00:07:20 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sweet dreams are made of this for Annie Lennox, honored by Queen Elizabeth II in the monarch's New Year list of awards.
</P>
<P>
The statuesque Scottish singer, who came to fame in 1980s duo Eurythmics, was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, or OBE, for her work with charities fighting AIDS and poverty in Africa. She is an ambassador for development group Oxfam and founded the SING campaign to help women and children with HIV.
</P>
<P>
Lennox said she was "getting my fake leopard pillbox hat dusted and ready" for the Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"As somewhat of a renegade, it either means I've done something terribly right -- or they've done something terribly wrong," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lennox, 56, is among several 1980s icons honored in Friday's list. Fashion designer Katharine Hamnett, creator of that decade's oversized "Choose Life" slogan T-shirts, and Grammy-winning music producer Trevor Horn, who honed the futuristic sound of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, were both named Commanders of the Order of the British Empire, or CBE.
</P>
<P>
Britain's honors are bestowed twice a year by the monarch -- at New Year's and on her official birthday in June -- but recipients are selected by committees of civil servants from nominations made by the government and the public.
</P>
<P>
In descending order, the honors are knighthoods, CBE, OBE and MBE -- Member of the Order of the British Empire. Knights are addressed as "sir" or "dame." Recipients of the other honors have no title but can put the letters after their names.
</P>
<P>
Most of the honors go to people who are not in the limelight, for services to their community or industry, but they also reward a sprinkling of famous faces.
</P>
<P>
Theater grande dame Harriet Walter was made a real dame -- the female equivalent of a knight -- in recognition of a career that has ranged from the Royal Shakespeare Company to TV cop show "Law and Order: UK."
</P>
<P>
Historian Antonia Fraser, biographer of Marie Antoinette and Mary, Queen of Scots, also became a dame.
</P>
<P>
Actor David Suchet -- best known for playing Agatha Christie's Belgian detective Hercule Poirot on television -- and actress Sheila Hancock both received CBEs. So did sculptor Richard Wentworth and Turner Prize-winning artist Steve McQueen, whose work includes a series of stamps featuring portraits of British troops killed in Iraq. He has unsuccessfully lobbied the Royal Mail to issue them for postal use.
</P>
<P>
Other entertainers honored were veteran actor Burt Kwouk -- best known as Cato in the "Pink Panther" movies -- and folk-rock musician Richard Thompson. Both received OBEs.
</P>
<P>
There also were OBEs for Academy Award-winning costume designer Sandy Powell ("Shakespeare In Love," "The Aviator") and movie director Andrea Arnold, whose gritty feature "Fish Tank" was a Cannes Film Festival prize-winner.
</P>
<P>
John Lloyd, the radio and television writer-producer behind comedy classics including "Spitting Image" and "Blackadder" received a CBE.
</P>
<P>
British-born NASA astronaut Piers Sellers received an OBE for services to science.
</P>
<P>
In the business world, British Airways chairman Martin Broughton was named a knight, despite a difficult year for the airline that saw customers inconvenienced in the thousands by a series of cabin crew strikes, the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud and the snow-induced closure of Heathrow Airport.
</P>
<P>
Broughton set off a flap about aviation security in October when he accused the U.S. of demanding "completely redundant" security checks at airports, such as removing shoes and separate examinations of laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
Roger Carr, chairman of energy company Centrica PLC, also was made a knight. Carr stepped down as chairman of Cadbury PLC earlier this year following the chocolate-maker's hostile takeover by U.S. food conglomerate Kraft Inc.
</P>
<P>
There were honors for politicians for the first time since an expenses scandal last year outraged voters and sullied Parliament's reputation. Peter Bottomley, a Conservative lawmaker since 1975, was made a knight "for public service." Labour legislator Ann Begg, the first full-time wheelchair user elected to Parliament, was made a dame for services to disabled people and equal opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Among the hundreds of names are people little known outside their communities or specialist fields. They include Eric Sutherns, the bridge master responsible for raising and lowering the arms of London's iconic Tower Bridge, and apiarist Anne Buckingham, awarded an MBE "for services to beekeeping in Surrey."

Sasha Vujacic traded from Lakers to Nets
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey 2010-12-15 19:18:11 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slovenian shooting guard Sasha Vujacic transferred to the New Jersey Nets from the Los Angeles Lakers in a three-team NBA trade involving the Houston Rockets on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nets sent veteran Joe Smith to Los Angeles, and swingman Terrence Williams to the Rockets, and, perhaps more important, earned two first-round draft picks.
</P>
<P>
"We're excited to get a player like Sasha who can come in and help us," Nets general manager Billy King said. "He's scrappy on defense and a good shooter on offense. He has experience with being on a champion. It's also an opportunity for us to get better with future draft picks."
</P>
<P>
The Nets acquired first-round picks from the Lakers in 2011, and the Rockets in 2012.
</P>
<P>
King said he expects 26-year-old Vujacic, who was not playing much with the Lakers, to come in and contribute right away, especially since starting shooting guard Anthony Morrow suffered a hamstring injury on Tuesday vs. Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
"He has to come in and learn the offense, but we're going to get him in and on the floor," King said of Vujacic, "because we need a player right now."
</P>
<P>
Vujacic, in his seventh year, averaged 4.8 points during his career in Los Angeles. He set the Lakers' single-season record for three-point accuracy in 2008, shooting at a .437 clip. He appeared in just 11 games this season, averaging 1.8 points.
</P>
<P>
Nets coach Avery Johnson will insert Vujacic into his regular rotation, quite possibly as early as Thursday when the Nets face the Los Angeles Clippers in Newark. Vujacic was set to arrive in New Jersey late Wednesday for a physical.
</P>
<P>
"We know he can shoot the ball," Johnson said. "It's nice to add someone with the capability to make a shot. We're excited to have him. We also acquired valuable picks, which gives us some flexibility. We need Sasha to play right away, because we need help at that position. I know he can come here and make shots."
</P>
<P>
Jordan Farmar, who played with Vujacic in Los Angeles, believes he can help.
</P>
<P>
"I describe him like a soccer player," Farmar said. "He has antics to get the crowd going. He also can shoot the ball well. He's feisty and competitive. He was sitting there and I know he's anxious to play. So, I'm happy for him. I'm looking forward to having him here. He's not going to come here and be a savior, but he brings experience and has a lot of big-game experience."

Vatican in new clash with China over church
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VATICAN CITY 2010-12-17 11:47:02 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Vatican has sharply condemned a meeting of senior members of China's government-backed church, citing violations of religious freedom and human rights.
</P>
<P>
A Vatican statement Friday said the "unacceptable and hostile acts" have damaged the dialogue and "the climate of trust" between the Holy See and the Beijing government.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting last week, the government-backed church elected new leaders, including a prelate unrecognized by the Vatican to head its bishops' council.
</P>
<P>
Communist China forced its Roman Catholics to cut ties with the Vatican in 1951. Only state-backed churches are recognized, although millions of Chinese belong to unofficial congregations loyal to Rome.

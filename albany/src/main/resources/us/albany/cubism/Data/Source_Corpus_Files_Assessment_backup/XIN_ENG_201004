<P>
The Honduran government Wednesday voiced its disapproval of a new immigration
law in the U.S. state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
The government said in a statement that "the Law SB1070, which classifies
immigration as a crime in the state of Arizona, is a wrong step, and it does not
offer right solutions for the immigration issue."
</P>
<P>
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer Friday approved the law, which makes it a crime to
stay illegally in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Seen as the toughest legislation in the nation, the law will require anyone whom
police suspect of being in the country illegally to produce "an alien
registration document," such as a green card, or other proof of citizenship such
as a passport or Arizona driver's license.
</P>
<P>
The law has aroused controversy among many leaders and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We join the appeal of U.S. President Barack Obama to the U.S. Congress to
realize that it is the time to boost a migratory reform to regularize the
situation of more than 11 million undocumented people living in the United
States," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Honduran deputies on Tuesday also condemned the new law, considering it "cruel"
and "discriminatory."
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said more than 1 million Honduran people live in the United States,
most of whom are undocumented. Therefore, it was of national interest to solve
the immigration issue.

They supported Hezbollah's rocket attacks into Israel.
In the crowd of protesters were both Lebanese flags, and flags of Hezbollah waving. And in the center of all this, leader of the Seperatist group Bloc Quebecois, Gilles Duceppe.

If Quebec ever seperated from Canada, would they become a harbour for terrorists? allowing them to set up camp, much like they did in Afghanistan to launch attacks accross the world?

Or would the Bloc allow terrorists to attack English Canada, to further the Seperatists desire to be independant? Quebec terrorism has happened in the past, remember the FLQ? and the October crises?

Does this concern you? especially if you live in Canada and or the United States?

What I can't tell is these 15000 Quebecers, are they "real" Canadians as in mostly French speaking white Quebecers? Or are they Arab muslims that the mainstream media refer to as "Canadians" because they don't want to appear as "anti-muslim?"

As I recall, the terrorist cell busted up by the mounties a few weeks ago were all "Canadians" as reported by the MSM. However, if you look closely, they were all muslims.

well Quebec is the most pacifist province and anti-american province in Canada, so i would bet my left nut that it was a healthy mix of French-Canadians, and Muslum Canadians.

As for the busted wannabees. they were Canadian, in the sence that they were born here in Canada, the oldest, the ring leader, i believe was an immigrant, he preached Hate in a Mississauga mosque.

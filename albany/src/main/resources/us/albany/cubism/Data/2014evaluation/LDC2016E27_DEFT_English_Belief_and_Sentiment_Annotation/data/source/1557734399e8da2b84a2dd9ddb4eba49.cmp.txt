Ok I just want to respond to a couple things said within this thread. First off..Chung Shi's are exclusive to Foot Solutions in the United States.
Secondly, you can stop in a Foot Solutions throughout the nation and try on these shoes AND try them on outside on the sidewalk. The reason we do the sidewalk test is so that you can feel the difference from carpet to cement. These shoes are made for hard surfaces and a lot of people that wear them are nurses, teachers, mechanics and etc that are standing on hard surfaces for long periods.
Third..There is a 2 week policy at our store and at almost all stores I know of [though Foot Solutions is a franchise so I can't really speak for them all] and it is not special for anyone unfortunately...the pedorathist that trained me are from Texas and trained at the Austin, Texas location.
I could continue on this subject but I do not want to get into the controversy of how the shoe works for the people that they do work for. This is something I do all day long and while I'm at home I like to not think about work so much. I happened to cross this thread, however, and just wanted to clear up a couple of things.

@Chai,

I just puchased a pair of chung shi shoes for a heel problem. I've had heal pain for 4 months with nothing helping. I put them on a 6pm and wore them till 5 am with little or no pain. It was wonderful. I could feel them work my legs but they said this happens. So far great shoe even though they cost so much. It takes a little time to get use to walking in them but I got the ones that are 15 degrees or a little less as each stile is diffrent. I paid $245 plus tax at foot solutions is Fargo ND.

I have a pair of their Level 1 Comfort Step Trekker Sandals ($235) and they are NOT comfortable at all.
I bought them from Foot Solutions, and I would have returned them if I could have.

@bartay98,

Thanks for posting that because I wanted a chance to brag about my own new sandals. I got the SAS Bravo, and it's totally comfortable right from the git-go. Haven't done long, hard walks in them, and probably won't. The places I go for walks have gravel and loose sand, which has been an issue with every sandal I've owned.

They look remarkably like Birkenstocks, but the resemblance is superficial. Birkies have your heel lower than the ball of the foot. More comfortable foot bed, too. I've never been happy with that, and a name brand physical therapist confirmed my impression. Also, SAS uses a very soft, lined leather for the uppers. List at $140.00, but the local shoe store found out they couldn't move sandals at that price in this town, so I got them at $70.00.

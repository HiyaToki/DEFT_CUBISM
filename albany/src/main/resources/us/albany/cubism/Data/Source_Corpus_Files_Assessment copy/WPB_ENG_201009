(Norfolk)

NORFOLK, Va. - Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell announced Friday that he will
declare next April "Civil War in Virginia" month, rather than "Confederate
History Month," as he once again apologized for a proclamation earlier this year
that omitted a reference to slavery's role in the war.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a scholarly conference on slavery and race held at Norfolk State
University, McDonnell called on Virginians to remember the war with a solemn
spirit of racial unity.
</P>
<P>
He called last year's proclamation an "error of haste and not of heart," a
misstep by an administration only a few months in office.
</P>
<P>
"My major and unacceptable omission of slavery disappointed and hurt a lot of
people - myself included," he said. "And it is an error that will be fixed."
</P>
<P>
McDonnell drew national criticism when shortly after taking office, he issued
the proclamation at the request of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.
</P>
<P>
Even President Barack Obama weighed in, chiding McDonnell for failing to mention
the role slavery played in the state that was the capital of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
Within days, McDonnell apologized and reissued the proclamation with a new
reference to the "abomination" of slavery.
</P>
<P>
For McDonnell, Friday's speech on race relations afforded an opportunity to try
to reverse the political damage of his Confederate proclamation but on his own
terms, and not as a reaction to April's media frenzy.
</P>
<P>
It could also help re-establish his reputation as a conservative who can also
speak to moderates, a key strategy of his 2009 campaign that took a beating
during the Confederate episode.
</P>
<P>
In welcoming remarks at Friday's conference, part of Virginia's commemoration of
the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, McDonnell promised that next year, he
will issue a proclamation that acknowledges the broad sweep of the war in
Virginia. He said it will be written to remember "all Virginians" - free and
enslaved, and those who fought for both sides.
</P>
<P>
"One hundred and fifty years is long enough for Virginia to fight the Civil
War," he said, drawing laughs and then appreciative applause from the 1,600
attendees of the seminar, titled "Race, Slavery and Civil War: The Tough Stuff
of American History and Memory."
</P>
<P>
An inclusive gubernatorial proclamation will ensure that "people across the
world will understand that Virginia has the capacity to grow and to change and
to acknowledge truth," said Sen. Yvonne Miller, D-Norfolk, a member of
Virginia's legislative black caucus.
</P>
<P>
McDonnell is not the first governor to stumble over the sensitivities of
observing the Civil War in a state with a history of difficult racial relations.
Gov. George Allen, R, sparked a similar outcry in 1997 when he issued a
proclamation calling the Civil War "a four-year struggle for [Southern]
independence and sovereign rights" and made no mention of slavery.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Gov. James Gilmore, R, rewrote the document, adding anti-slavery
language. Later, he designated April as "Virginia's Month for Remembrance of the
Sacrifices and Honor of All Virginians Who Served in the Civil War."
</P>
<P>
Govs. Mark Warner and Timothy Kaine, both Democrats, issued no April
proclamation. In 2002, Warner had declared that the exercise damaged efforts to
bridge divides between blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five months, McDonnell has worked to repair the political damage
caused by his misstep. He has held private meetings with civil rights leaders
and contributed $10,000 from his inaugural fund to a civil rights museum.
</P>
<P>
Last week, he unveiled a portrait at the state Capitol of Barbara Johns, who in
1951 - when she was 16 - helped lead a walkout at her all-black school to
protest poor conditions at segregated schools.
</P>
<P>
For months, he and his staff have seen Friday's conference, one of a series of
annual scholarly summits on the Civil War that the state will hold through 2015,
as a chance to reset the tone for Virginia's observance of the sesquicentennial
of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
"A modern Virginia has emerged from her past, strong, vibrant and diverse," he
said. "Now a modern Virginia will take four years and remember that past with
candor, with courage and with conciliation."
</P>
<P>
He called slavery an "evil and inhumane practice" but acknowledged that Virginia
struggled to afford all its citizens equality long after its abolition. He also
praised the state's progress, including making Douglas Wilder, D, the nation's
first elected black governor in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"It was great - he was knowledgeable of African American history and culture,"
said Rickey Willis, a Portsmouth resident who attended the conference. "There
are eight million people in Virginia. African American culture played a valuable
role."
</P>
<P>
Wilder, who is close to McDonnell but had been highly critical of his
Confederate proclamation, said the governor called him Friday morning to discuss
the remarks, which Wilder described as "very impressive."
</P>
<P>
"The governor recognizes that we must observe real history, not revisionist
history," Wilder said.
</P>
<P>
McDonnell's announcement Friday drew sharp words, however, from Brag Bowling,
the former commander of the Virginia division of the Sons of Confederate
Veterans.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's cowardly of him," Bowling said. "He didn't have the intestinal
fortitude to stand up to his political enemies or the media."
</P>
<P>
Bowling accused McDonnell of selling out Virginia's Confederate descendents to
make himself more palatable for a possible run for national office. "Our
organization, to a man, will be opposed to this. There will be a lot of
political fallout for doing this."
</P>
<P>
Sam Mosley, who came to the Norfolk conference from Lynchburg, where his wife
serves on the board of an African American history museum, said McDonnell helped
heal deep wounds with his statement. He urged McDonnell to make racial
reconciliation a theme of his term.
</P>
<P>
"If he really means this, if he can sell it and if he can promote it, I believe
we'll be a lot farther ahead," he said.

Settled Into Senate, Franken Finds His Spark Again (Washn)
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON POST-BLOOMBERG--09-03-10 1103ET

<P>
WASHINGTON - Slowly but surely, the Air America version of Sen. Al Franken is
making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
After largely keeping his head down during his first year in the Senate,
Franken, D-Minn., is showing hints of the rhetorical fire that made him such a
lightning rod during his 2008 campaign against then-Sen. Norm Coleman, R.
</P>
<P>
Although Franken made his name as a writer and an actor on NBC's "Saturday Night
Live," his first interviews during the campaign were notably humorless and
wonky. There was no sign of the liberal firebrand who wrote the book "Rush
Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot" and later railed against George W. Bush's
administration on the start-up Air America radio network.
</P>
<P>
After defeating Coleman, Franken turned down requests for national media
interviews and, on the whole, just tried to blend in with his Senate colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Now that he's a little more comfortable and established in Washington, those
close to Franken say he's more liberated - and it's showing.
</P>
<P>
Before the Netroots Nation conference in July, Franken told the ThinkProgress
blog that the Republican Party doesn't want Americans to get jobs right now
because the party wants to win in November.
</P>
<P>
When a plan for an Islamic center near Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan became a
national issue, even some top Democrats steered clear of the topic. But Franken
gave one of the starkest statements of support, hitting the other side's tactics
as "one of the most disgraceful things that I've heard."
</P>
<P>
In June, during Senate hearings on whether to confirm Elena Kagan to the Supreme
Court, Franken criticized the court, saying that a recent ruling favored big
corporations by putting a "fist" on the scales of justice - "a fist with brass
knuckles." Then, early last month, Franken reportedly mocked Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., during the latter's floor speech opposing Kagan.
</P>
<P>
McConnell reprimanded Franken, according to those familiar with the exchange, by
saying: "This is not 'Saturday Night Live,' Al." Franken apologized.
</P>
<P>
Norm Ornstein, an American Enterprise Institute scholar who is close with
Franken, compared the senator's Senate evolution to those of Hillary Rodham
Clinton, D-N.Y., and Bill Bradley, D-N.J.) - both of whom entered the Senate
with a considerable amount of celebrity and something to prove.
</P>
<P>
Ornstein said Franken isn't going to be afraid to show his political stripes.
"There are going to be some areas, no doubt, where he will be a liberal
spokesman," Ornstein said. "I think the court is clearly one of them. At the
same time, I think in a whole host of other areas, he's going to be more
pragmatic."
</P>
<P>
Franken's celebrity cuts both ways for his party. He is a great fundraising tool
for Democrats, but he's also a great fundraising tool for Republicans. And
during his 2008 campaign, Democrats privately - and in some cases, publicly -
worried about whether they wanted him in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Democrats have used Franken behind the scenes to raise money, which he
did well for his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Franken has participated in events for Rep. Stephanie Herseth
Sandlin, S.D., Sen. Russell Feingold, Wis., and Ohio Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher's
Senate campaign. He has also done a joint event for the Senate campaigns of
Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan and Rep. Paul W. Hodes, N.H., and
teamed with Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, Ill., for a fundraiser in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Franken has his own reelection to worry about in 2014, and Minnesota
isn't a great place for a hard-line partisan in a statewide race.
</P>
<P>
"He's still very sensitive to the fact that there's a stereotype out there of
'Angry Al,' " Ornstein said.

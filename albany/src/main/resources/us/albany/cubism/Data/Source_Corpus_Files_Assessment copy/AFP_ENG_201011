Stop contacting Mandela: Foundation

The Nelson Mandela Foundation on Thursday asked people to respect the retirement
of the aging former South African president and stop incessant attempts to
contact him, a statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Nelson Mandela Foundation would like to ask people everywhere to help make
Madiba's retirement a time of peace and tranquillity," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to his foundation, the 92-year-old Nobel Laureate receives 4,000
requests per month for autographs, public appearances, and endorsement of
various humanitarian causes around the globe.
</P>
<P>
"Given the huge number of projects and causes he is asked to endorse, and the
impossibility of selecting a few among the many worthy requests, he no longer
provides messages of support, written or audio visual," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
After his withdrawal from public life in 2004, Mandela created the Nelson
Mandela Foundation, the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund and the Mandela Rhodes
Foundation to continue humanitarian work on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, South Africa's first black president, is increasingly frail and has not
appeared publicly since the closing ceremony of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
In July, the much-loved statesman through his lawyers distanced himself from a
London exhibition of lithographs bearing his signature.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mandela threatened legal action after Congo Republic President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso published a book with a foreword said to have been written by
him.

Obama says Myanmar junta 'stole' election

<TEXT>
<P>
US President Barack Obama Monday accused the Myanmar junta of stealing the
weekend election in the military-ruled country, sharpening his earlier criticism
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Citing Myanmar as an example of a country where a "bankrupt regime" imprisoned
opponents and gunned down protesters, he said it was incumbent on all
democracies to condemn repressive regimes.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable to steal an election, as the regime in Burma (Myanmar) has
done again for all the world to see," he said in a speech at the Indian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
He also criticised his hosts for sometimes failing to speak out sufficiently for
the rights of the repressed.
</P>
<P>
"If I can be frank, in international fora, India has often shied away from these
issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Once a staunch supporter of Myanmar's pro-democracy movement, India began
engaging the junta in the mid-1990s as security, energy and strategic priorities
came to the fore.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's election was strongly criticised by Western governments because of
widespread complaints of intimidation and the detention of democracy icon Aung
San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
India has made no statement on the election, which Obama condemned on Sunday as
neither free nor fair.

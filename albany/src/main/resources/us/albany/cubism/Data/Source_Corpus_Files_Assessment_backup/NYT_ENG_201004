WEIGHT WATCHERS ENLISTS HUDSON IN LOSING BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The previous campaign for Weight Watchers featured a furry
critter that tempted dieters with high-calorie foods. Now, the
company has decided to get real: its new campaign will star the
actress and singer Jennifer Hudson, who will talk about what she
has experienced in her quest to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
Hudson, 28, who won an Academy Award in 2007 for her role as the
singer Effie in "Dreamgirls," followed a Weight Watchers program
for several months, tracking what she ate, intensifying her
exercise routine and meeting weekly with a diet coach. The
Grammy-winning singer dropped a noticeable, but undisclosed, number
of pounds -- a topic of celebrity gossip sites and blogs -- in the
months since she gave birth to her first child, a boy, last August.
</P>
<P>
The results of the weight loss -- Hudson says in one television
spot that "I've never been this size in my adult life" -- are on
display in four commercials, which make up the Weight Watchers
campaign that began Sunday. Weight Watchers, which holds more than
30,000 weekly meetings in the United States for people trying to
lose weight, spends about $90 million a year on advertising
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The commercials show a slimmed-down Hudson, who competed on
"American Idol" in 2004, and are meant to convey that she is a
"regular woman who has struggled with her weight, but has found a
winning formula that works for her life," said Cheryl Callan,
director for marketing at Weight Watchers North America.
</P>
<P>
"She is very relatable and accessible," Callan said "And
she's interested in being a role mode."
</P>
<P>
The commercials will appear on prime-time shows, including
"Dancing With the Stars," "Extreme Home Makeover," "How I Met
Your Mother" and on all three national morning shows, as well as
on "Ellen," "The Oprah Winfrey Show," "The View" and "Live
With Regis and Kelly." Print ads will appear in O, Winfrey's
magazine, and in the Weight Watchers magazine.

ROMNEY TOUTS RUBIO AS MAN WITH MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAMPA  Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney endorsed Marco
Rubio's campaign for the U.S. Senate at a rally Monday, saying
Rubio's message of a less-intrusive government is what Americans
need to hear.
</P>
<P>
Romney, a 2008 presidential candidate who many believe will run
again in 2012, said Rubio is prepared to stand up to a group Romney
termed "neo-monarchists"  people who supported the government
bailout of the U.S. financial institutions and auto industry.
</P>
<P>
"We're saying no to that," Romney told a group of 250 Rubio
supporters at the Dr. Blaise F. Alfano Conference and Banquet
Center near the University of South Florida campus. "We're saying
we want to let Americans pursue their own dreams."
</P>
<P>
Romney shared a stage with Rubio, the former state House
speaker, and former state Senate President Tom Lee.
</P>
<P>
During about 10 minutes of remarks, Romney praised Rubio's
personal story: the 38-year-old son of Cuban-born parents who
immigrated to Miami.
</P>
<P>
Some in the crowd waited nearly two hours to hear Rubio and
Romney speak.
</P>
<P>
Rubio "says just what I feel," said Wilma Martin, 79, of
Tampa, a Republican who has supported Rubio's GOP opponent, Gov.
Charlie Crist, in the past.
</P>
<P>
Crist "has done some very good things," Martin said. "I just
like this one (pointing to Rubio) better."
</P>
<P>
Romney previously said he would stay out of the Florida Senate
primary, but with Rubio comfortably leading in most polls, Romney's
entry is unlikely to ruffle feathers. Rubio already has been
endorsed by 2008 presidential contenders Mike Huckabee and Rudy
Giuliani. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, is
supporting Crist.

HUTAREE-DET
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Other militias told on Hutaree


      FBI is told group


      is 'kind of creepy'
      By Mike Wilkinson


      The Detroit News
</P>
<P>
Long before they were charged with trying to start an
anti-government war, members of the Hutaree militia group made
enemies among a group they may have considered allies: the local
militias with whom they occasionally trained.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being brothers-in-arms, those other groups became
deeply suspicious of the religious and violence -tinged rhetoric of
the Hutaree and warned the FBI about the group in late 2008.
</P>
<P>
Two members of the Southern Michigan Volunteer Militia said this
week they provided the FBI with information on the Hutaree,
identifying them as "kind of creepy" and considering them a
threat that the FBI should keep an eye on.
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury indictment unsealed March 29 alleges David
Stone Sr. of Clayton in Lenawee County and eight followers belong
to a radical militia called the Hutaree plotted to kill police
officers and wage war against the U.S. government. Charges include
seditious conspiracy and attempted use of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
"I saw them as damaging our organization in particular and the
movement as a whole," said Mike Lackomar, a spokesman for the
Southern Michigan Volunteer Militia.
</P>
<P>
Others sent e-mails to the FBI about the group. And ultimately
one militia member was so concerned he joined the Hutaree to see
what they were about. That man is now considered a "cooperating
witness" in the case.
</P>
<P>
The revelations may surprise those who view militia members as a
singular, tight-knit group that rallies around gun rights and
anti-government attitudes.
</P>
<P>
But to the Southeast Michigan Militia, an umbrella group that
represents hundreds of members, the Hutaree was different to a
fault. No one in the southeast group advocated killing police
officers as a way of sparking a revolution designed to protect the
work of Jesus, they said.
</P>
<P>
"That's just rotten and wrong," said Lee Miracle, coordinator
for the Southeast Michigan Militia. "What part of that is
supporting the Constitution?"
</P>
<P>
The day before the 2008 presidential election, the FBI reached
out to several militia members. A general militia meeting was
planned for the day after the election, Miracle and Lackomar said,
and the FBI was trying to find out what was on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
During that conversation, the FBI agent asked if there was
anything the agency should be looking into; if they had heard of
any threats. Several militia members had the same answer: the
Hutaree.
</P>
<P>
Miracle said he steered the FBI to the Hutaree Web site with a
question: "See if they creep you out the way they creep me out,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
FBI spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold said she could neither confirm
nor deny how the militia groups helped the FBI.
</P>
<P>
But a University of Michigan graduate student who is studying
the militia movement said she was aware of the contact between the
two and said she saw e-mails from the militia to the FBI about the
Hutaree. She declined to say who wrote those e-mails.
</P>
<P>
The student, Amy Cooter, who has interviewed dozen of militia
members, said she steered clear of the Hutaree in part because of
safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
She said she isn't surprised the militia alerted the FBI. The
Hutaree was advocating a distrust of law enforcement, she said,
that doesn't match the beliefs of most militia members. "I could
tell they weren't representative of the other militias in the
state," she said.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the cooperating witness has not been disclosed,
nor has the identity of the undercover FBI agent who also
infiltrated the group. Lackomar said he doesn't know who the
cooperating witness is -- "that's the $10,000 question, isn't
it?" he asked -- but said he has no problems that someone from his
group essentially spied on another militia.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, they did the right thing and possibly saved
lives," he said.

      Hutaree hearing
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors want to reschedule a hearing for appeals of
detention orders for nine accused members of the Hutaree militia.
U.S. District Judge Victoria Roberts has set the hearing for April
27. Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Falvey said in a court filing
Friday that that date conflicts with ordered training in the Marine
Corps Reserve, in which Falvey serves as a colonel. Falvey asked
that the hearing be either Monday through Wednesday or after April
30.

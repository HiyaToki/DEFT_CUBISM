So let mr get this straight: Obama does not have the freedom of speech to say what he wants to say about Fox News?

No, Obama is indicating that FOX doesn't.

I believe he is within his rights to do so just as much as commentators on Fox News can insinuate that he was born in Kenya.

no, its YOU that is the fucking moron

The manufactured outrages and distortion of reality (which is taken as Gospel from some of their viewers) coming from Fox has played a role in furthering the divide in our nation.

Fox News is a sum of its parts cletus. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

Seems to me the last time Obama whined about Fox News, people tuned into Fox to see what the hubbub was all about.

Obama: Fox News is... 09-29-2010 01:55 AM DiveCon you're pathetic

When the President of the United States makes a STATEMENT that a news organization is destructive it is MUCH more than an opinion.

It indicates, when taken with all his other open attacks on the News Agency, that he has an agenda and he is trying to silence or curtail the rights of said News Agency to broadcast.

He has lost to the people on it and because the other News Agencies rightly saw that if they allowed him to ban Fox they could be next.

If Bush had come out against one of the other News Organizations you Liberal dumb fucks would have shit your pants.

Fox news is not even remotely destructive.

What does Bush have to do with Obama's comments about Fox?

As President he knew he had no business threatening a News organization.

Once again you weasel, Obama has openly threatened a News Organization, he has tried to ban them from the White House.

You don't need to break the law to be "destructive" and Fox News is most certainly destructive, IMO.

Best thing about Fox?

Fox News is trying to derail his presidency.

They're supposed to be objectively reporting the news.

Fuck Fox News.

When it comes to our ruined economy we aren't allowed to bring him up but now that Obama said something mean to Fox News it's BOOOOOSHHHH didn't do this but Obama is doing that.

You did not mind when all the other Broadcast news organizations were trying to derail George Bush.

The left were ok with it when it was Bush, so tough shit that ONE news outlet calls Obama to account.

<img src="http://www.bartcop.com/fox-news-nazi-comply.jpg"/>

The constant whining about the big bad evil Fox is just laughable.

Fox News is destructive to Obama's Presidency.

Problem is Obama thinks his presidency is more important then America or the wants and needs of it's citizens so he tries to rationalize that because his presidency is so important...so historical....then Fox News is a threat.

So in Obama's warped prospective Fox News is destructive to America.

Its gotta be because FOX news, the only right wing news agency out there, isn't falling all over him like the rest of the LSM.

FOX news that actually investigates him is to blame.

Seems to me I remember he started a war with FOX when he was first elected.

Don't think another war with FOX will turn out any better this time around.

If you don't like Fox news, then you have the total freedom of choice not to watch it.

obama is still all butt hurt over fox news, so he continues his whining about them...

unfortunately for obama, history shows us that everytime he has done this about fox or rush etc...their ratings increase <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

can you imagine if bush spent his time complaining about the lefty newsies...the left would have been outraged and called him hitler...oh wait...they did that anyways....

Just because Fox News doesn't spew talking points direct from their blackberries like MSNBC does, that doesn't make them destructive.

Fox has a Massive Viewership, by far the largest, and all he is doing is Motivating his Opposition.

His usual tactic is to sue them but he can't because he can't prove Fox is being discriminatory.

Charles Krauthammer was on FOX NEWS last night.

Give us some examples of Fox News destroying the obama presidency.

FoxLies has done more damage to America than Al Qaeda ever will.

Anyone who can't see the evil of FoxLies is a fool.

FoxLies is a disgrace.

Fox news came along

now.. they need time to adjust

I just get irked when some lib Rails about Fox lies, and ignores MSLSD and the other liberal networks and their lies.

Old enough to know the difference between freedom of the press, and a terrorist group that flew planes into buildings killing thousands.

That's because MSNBC doesn't lie like Fox does.

How UTTERLY self absorbed in one's own vitriol dones one have to be, that just because Fox makes liberals mad, it MUST be as BAD as Al Queda?

Yeah, but but but, Fox News is worse!!!!!!!!!!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_snooty.gif"/>

We are talking about an organization that is dedicated to killing innocent people, and HE thinks Fox News is worse because Fox News puts his underwear in a bunch????????

There is a great documentary about FoxLies called "OutFoxed".

That's why they love FOX and Rush.

No, the problem is that Fox News thinks the destruction of his presidency is more important than America.

Is that where you got the idea that Fox News is worse than Al Queda?

Uh yeah and FOX NEWS ISN'T?????????????

Let's hear it <a href="http://www.newshounds.us/2010/09/30/fox_news_ratings_plunge_msnbc_ratings_rise.php#more">for KARMA-TIME</a> !!!!!!

Fox points it out. That's not propaganda.

DUMPING on the AMERCIAN CITIZENS and News Stations...How becoming of a United States President.

Obama shouldn't have just singled out Fox News.

The people who clanishly lap up every word on Fox's talkathons do so because they want to see the Obama Administration "destroyed." Which feeds the popularity of Fox, which attracts the advertisers, which is all that matters.

Referring to the last paragraph of your link, my biggest criticism of Fox, ironically, is that it does NOT "[focus] on the critical issues that Americans are concerned about." It focuses on tabloid-esque "stories" which they will squeeze the blood out of until the next non-story comes along to promote its right wing agenda.

FoxNews consists of sensationalist entertainment, with "news" injected as fillers.

Fox might suck.............but ya gotta stop and think for a moment.

Every time Obama opens his mouth about FOX, its party time for Mr Bush..................

Ant the fact that they are the most watched news network seems to elude you....

Honestly, why get your news from the TV anyway?

They are not the most watched news, that would be Brian Williams.

They are the most watched cable news network, and their viewship is largely over 65 white people.

What president before Obama told us not to listen to a news source.

I want the quotes of Bush telling Democrats not to listen to some liberal, like Obama told Republicans not to listen to Rush, or now Fox news.

Liberals are the last ones to predict when Fox or Rush will lose viewership, because they will be the last ones to EVER UNDERSTAND WHY they have that viewership!

FoxLies is not news.

Fox News Channel dropped 19 percent in Q3, with an average nightly delivery of 1.84 million viewers.

They never want to get off their ass and do their own research.

They always expect you to do it for them.

That's not how you judge news outlets!

Against some stupid cable channel.

You judge them by other NEWS OUTLETS, not some stupid cable channel showing reruns of House!

Try this where you can see Fox News scores CONSISTENTLY WAY HIGHER than the wannabe competition.

Keep dreaming of Fox's demise.

As time goes on the over 65 year old white people that watch FoxLies will gradually die out.

Fox's ratings are down 19 percent since last year.

Link to a Fox news commentator insinuating Obama was born in Kenya.

Most of the young are watching Stewart for News.

Which puts those inbetween as Fox News viewers.

Just like the Obamabots have paid "protestors" to astroturf for them, they also have the same trolling internet chat rooms, boards, and blog comment sections.

They will do his dirty work for him. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

They are doomed.

Obama meant to say: Fox News (or the Opposition) is destructive to my dreams of authoritarianism.

Really.........thank God for FOX news.

If you're a Republican it's "destructive" aren't they whiney little bitches though? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_angel.gif"/>

I'm as sleazy as they come.

That's not a good defense of Fox News....Deflection activated

I'd believe that bullshit if the "e" and the "a" were side by side, which they ain't so you clearly were being an ignorant DUmmie.

They have a different meaning, but when you don't know the spelling difference it doesn't necessarily mean you don't know the meaning of the fucking word you're using, idiot, it means you don't know the spelling difference.

And if they aren't fat now they will get fat.

And if they don't get fat they will get saggy.

They hire them.

They're different by one letter, surely you can see where one might mix their spellings up?

Your hypocritical lib, who lectures us about being hard hearted, "mean spirited" and then look at what they will do to baby, in the name of their power.

They kill millions of babies a year in the name of their power.

Yeah, funny how they were all silent about that, and a nerve was only struck AFTER someone mentioned the Obama kids.

Funny how it's okay for libs to use gay as a pejorative, but you bring up something like gay marriage, and SUDDENLY they get all self righteous and you better not even so much as BREATHE the word gay without complete reverence as one of their vaunted "victims."

You want to know why they never found a cure for AIDS?

hey JFK.....just because someone disagrees with you doesnt mean they are a "Republican"....Dive aint no republican....

FoxLies is the propaganda wing of the Republican Party.

NewsCorp, the parent company of FoxLies, donated $1 million dollars to the Republican Governors Association.

Shouldn't the Republicans be giving money to Fox?

They aren't bailing out union pensions with billions of dollars of Stimulus funds.

They aren't pushing bailout bills to prop up their media suckups.

The only thing they ever do is give a tax cut or a tax refund to businesses to help create jobs.

But, historically, that is how they operate...

It really is indicative of how they see things.

Liberals think they are entitled to all views being THEIRS.

The fact that they can't stop ONE NEWS OUTLET from expressing differing views, just DRIVES THEM INSANE.

No wonder they call the Constitution a "living document." They want to live to see it's demise.

They only thrive when they can control the message.

They tend to ask him how he thinks he's doing.

It would be Tough if they called him out when he said he thought he was doing well, but they never do.

They let him control the narrative.

Fox News Network is the best thing that ever happened to Americans who want to see their country remain free.

Go Fox! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/clap2.gif"/>

I'm sure he prefers CNN (Communist News Network) which hires drunk driving racist murderous buffoons like Ricky Sanchez.

This is just one more reason to love &amp; respect Fox News.

They're the only Media Outlet that doesn't shamefully lick Hopey Changey's boots on a daily basis.

Without Fox News we wouldn't get any truth about this White House &amp; Democrats.

They've been in bed with the Democrats for several decades.

Personally i thank God everyday for Fox News and Talk Radio.

So keep on Rockin Fox News!

So the magic question is...How is Fox news the same to conservatives as everyone else is to liberals?

They deserve it.

After putting up with their abuse for months, I decided to give it right back.

If they don't like what they are getting, then they need to change what they give out.

I have to admit that I'm genuinely surprised that Obama continues to throw stones at FOXNEWS.

Here's the bottom line: Obama objects to FOXNEWS because it presents a point of view that is opposite to his.

And I'm not defending FOXNEWS.

The principle here is that when any head of state publicly attacks any news organization, that head of state puts himself at a great disadvantage.

He is convinced that everyone would love him if it weren't for Fox.

So Obama is applauded by the libs for giving his opinion on how Fox is destructive for America, yet he is incapable of giving his opinion on the wisdom of building a mosque at Ground Zero?

how is fox the same as other news orgs?

They have NO liberal hosts, donate to Republicans (the company donates to repubs not Idividuals big difference), is headed by an admitted partisan hack, and takes Internet rumor as facts.

So how are they the same as all the news orgs you claim to be liberal?

They are not the same libtard.

They are the number one cable news chanel.

Dan Rather and NBC News did not take rumor as fact in the George Bush airforce reserve letter case?

You're right, they are not the same.

They are better.

Their reporting was much fairer.

Look at Bernard Goldberg's Great Slobbering Love Affair and the studies he brings showing the Lamestream Media's coverage of Obama was wildly partisan while Fox's was "fair and balanced".

Let's ask a republican who the best news org is and you're surprised that he chose the company that pays him and reinforces his views.

No one at Fox has lost his job because no one has committed the atrocities to truth that Rather did.

Ok, they HAD one liberal host in 20 years...you got me.

Still trying to understand why say fox is just like other news orgs then get mad when someone asks how.

It's ok if you BELIEVE they are but that is different than what they really are.

It is clear to me that Fox has an overt political agenda, but the Presidency is above this nonsense.

A better politician would have one of his surrogates attack Fox News and stay above the fray.

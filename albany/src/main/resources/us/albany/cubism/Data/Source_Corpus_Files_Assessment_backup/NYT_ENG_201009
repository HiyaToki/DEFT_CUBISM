BIG TEN POWER TEAM FACES RED-HOT TEST IN THE DESERT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On one of the lousiest September slates on the 2010 calendar,
there is only one matchup between ranked teams. Fans had a preview
of Saturday night's Iowa-Arizona game a year ago when the host
Hawkeyes beat Arizona, 27-17.
</P>
<P>
But this is a different Arizona team. It's ranked 24th thanks
primarily to one man, quarterback Nick Foles, who replaced
frustrated starter Matt Scott in the fourth quarter of that loss a
year ago and has started ever since.
</P>
<P>
"We were young last year," Foles told reporters this week. "I
think we've grown together as a team, and that's going to be the
key in this game."
</P>
<P>
Foles is a major NFL prospect, hitting 83 percent of his passes
through two games. But Toledo and the Citadel aren't in the
ninth-ranked Hawkeyes' class. Iowa lost two linebackers from last
year but the front line, led by defensive end Adrian Clayborn, is
one of the best in the country.
</P>
<P>
Arizona, a 1 1/2-point underdog, has a terrific three-pronged
attack with Foles throwing to Juron Criner, who already has 236
yards on 12 catches through two games.
</P>
<P>
"Last year we were more concerned with the run from the
quarterback position," Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. "Foles is
not looking to run. He's looking to throw the football."
</P>
<P>
Arizona tailback Nic Grigsby, a 1,000-yard rusher in 2008, is
healthy again after fighting through a sore shoulder last year. His
Iowa counterpart, Adam Robinson, is off to a great start, gaining
109 yards and three TDs against Eastern Illinois and 156 yards
against Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
Who makes it go, though, is quarterback Ricky Stanzi. He's 20-4
as a starter.

FACEBOOK PROMOTES ITS VIRTUAL CREDITS TO MAKE REAL DOLLARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PALO ALTO, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all its success, Google is often
criticized for being a one-trick pony. After 12 years, the Internet
search company is still struggling to find a significant new
revenue source to supplement its lucrative text advertising
business.
</P>
<P>
Facebook, which more than any other company aspires to usurp
Google's dominant place on the Internet, hopes to avoid that
problem. Already on the path to becoming an advertising powerhouse,
the social networking company is laying the groundwork for its
second act: a virtual currency system that some day could turn into
a multibillion-dollar business.
</P>
<P>
Facebook began testing its virtual currency, called Credits,
more than a year ago with some popular games on Facebook. This
month, Credits passed a milestone when it became the exclusive
payment method for most of the games created by Zynga, the No. 1
developer of Facebook applications.
</P>
<P>
Zynga is expected to have $500 million in revenue this year,
according to the Inside Network, which tracks Facebook
applications, as millions of users pay real money to buy virtual
goods on games like FarmVille and Mafia Wars. Through Credits,
Facebook will take a 30 percent cut.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, Facebook expects that Credits will be
used to buy the vast majority of virtual goods sold on Facebook.
The fast-growing market is expected to reach $835 million on
Facebook this year, according to the Inside Network. To bolster
that market, Facebook began selling Credits gift cards at Target
stores this month.
</P>
<P>
For now, Facebook says it simply wants Credits to help foster
the growth of virtual goods transactions. But Mark Zuckerberg, the
chief executive, said recently that the company may choose to do
"a lot more" with Credits.
</P>
<P>
Over time, the company plans to turn Credits into a system for
micropayments that could be open to any application on Facebook, be
it a game or perhaps a media company, people with direct knowledge
of Facebook's plans said. They spoke anonymously because the plans
have not been announced publicly.
</P>
<P>
In addition to games, which account for the vast majority of
money spent on Facebook, more than 1 million other applications run
on the site. In the future, many of those may choose to charge for
access to certain features or to things like music, videos or news
articles.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts and industry insiders say that expanding Credits
makes sense and could eventually put Facebook in competition with
PayPal, Google, Amazon and others for a slice of the growing pie of
online transactions.
</P>
<P>
"If they can get 50 million registered credit cards, why
wouldn't they use them to pay for your newspaper subscription?"
said Alex Rampell, the chief executive of TrialPay, an advertising
company that offers free Facebook Credits to people who buy certain
products.
</P>
<P>
Others say the potential for using Credits could extend beyond
the Facebook site, through Facebook Connect, a service that allows
users to log in to sites across the Web using their Facebook
identities.
</P>
<P>
"There is a huge opportunity for Facebook to use Facebook
Connect to offer seamless checkout on other sites," said Ron
Hirson, a senior vice president at Boku, a start-up company that
enables online payments using a cell phone. "They are focusing on
games and apps now, but it would make sense for them to go into
other" product categories.
</P>
<P>
For now, Facebook prefers to play down talk of its broader
ambitions for Credits. Dan Rose, Facebook's vice president for
partnerships and platform marketing, talks about the usefulness of
Credits while playing Facebook games. Users will have a single
currency they can spend on any game, sparing them the trouble of
entering the credit card or PayPal credentials multiple times, he
says.
</P>
<P>
It works much like Apple's App Store, which allows users to
enter their credit cards or PayPal accounts once and buy
applications from any developer. Apple also takes a 30 percent cut
of sales on iTunes and its app store.
</P>
<P>
Rose said that while some developers may initially see a decline
in revenue because of Facebook's commission, the plan is for
Credits to more than offset that loss over time, because Credits
will make it easier to spend more in a game.
</P>
<P>
"We need to be able to grow the total level of money spent,"
Rose said.
</P>
<P>
Facebook is also helping lubricate the system by giving its
developers credits that they can give away to users.
</P>
<P>
Some developers say they already have made gains.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing the number of paying users increase and the
revenue per user increase, and FB deserves a lot of the credit for
it," said Mark Hull, vice president for marketing at CrowdStar,
whose Happy Aquarium game is among the most popular on Facebook.
</P>
<P>
Rose said that if Facebook succeeds, Credits "could grow it to
a size where over time it will become a material revenue
generator." For now, he said, Facebook plans to reinvest revenue
from Credits into improving its software for developers.
</P>
<P>
But Facebook's ambitions are unmistakable. Credits is backed by
a sizable engineering and product team that is full of PayPal
veterans.
</P>
<P>
"It is a lot like PayPal in the early days," said Deb Liu, a
former director of corporate strategy at PayPal who is now product
marketing manager for Credits. "We are moving fast and changing
the industry."
</P>
<P>
For now, Credits is not a rival to PayPal or other payment
systems. In February, Facebook signed an agreement with PayPal, a
unit of eBay, making PayPal one of the preferred ways to finance
Credits accounts. Facebook users can buy Credits using their credit
cards and some mobile payments services.
</P>
<P>
Since Zynga was one of PayPal's largest customers, Facebook is
now a significant customer as well.
</P>
<P>
"Facebook has been a great partner," Osama Bedier, PayPal's
vice president for platform, said.
</P>
<P>
But as Credits expands beyond Facebook games, it could collide
with a number of others competing for a piece of the growing
commerce in digital goods. They include Apple, the leading seller
of music and apps; Google, whose Checkout system is used in
e-commerce and on the company's app store for mobile phones; and
even Amazon, which is seeking to expand its payment system across
the Web.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Facebook's ambitions might well run into the same
obstacles that have thwarted Google and Amazon as they have sought
to expand across the Web.
</P>
<P>
"Facebook is a very innovative company, but we have had two
large innovative companies, Google and Amazon, that have spent a
fair amount of effort on payments," said Mark Mahaney, an analyst
at Citigroup. Those companies have yet to gain much traction, he
said. "I have to think that the odds against Facebook are steep."

KARL ROVE CALLS COLORADO GOVERNOR RACE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
DENVER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GOP strategist and midterm-election-fundraising
rainmaker Karl Rove said Wednesday that young voters are natural
Republicans because they are independent in nature and that "the
generation that goes around with an iPod is not a generation that
likes to be dictated to."
</P>
<P>
"They're our kind of people," Rove said. "They have an
instinctive knowledge that markets work."
</P>
<P>
Rove also told the audience, gathered for a Heritage Foundation
event in south Denver, that Colorado's gubernatorial race is one of
the "weirdest things" in the country.
</P>
<P>
"What in the heck were you thinking?" he said, referring to
the battle between conservatives Dan Maes, the Republican nominee,
and American Constitution Party candidate Tom Tancredo.
</P>
<P>
The audience roared.
</P>
<P>
He gave a nod to Colorado Republicans vying for a few House
seats, including Ryan Frazier, Scott Tipton and Cory Gardner -- all
running against incumbent Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Rove has made headlines this election season for his political
action committee, American Crossroads, which has raised almost $8
million to help Republicans in races across the country, according
to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks alone in Colorado, that committee has
spent almost $1.2 million in ads against incumbent Democratic Sen.
Michael Bennet.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Rove called Bennet's opponent Ken Buck "the next
U.S. senator from Colorado."
</P>
<P>
Rove was in Denver promoting his new book, "Courage and
Consequence."
</P>
<P>
He said his biggest regret in his seven years serving as former
President George W. Bush's senior adviser was not lashing back at
Democrats in 2003 when they started publicly rebuking Bush, saying
he had lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said prominent Democrats, including former presidential
hopefuls John Kerry and John Edwards, believed there were weapons
of mass destruction, and then they turned around and lied about it.
</P>
<P>
"They lied for political gain," he said. "If you want to
excoriate Bush, you have to be honest and excoriate those
Democrats."
</P>
<P>
Rove said America's deficit could have the potential of being
"Greece on steroids,  only we won't have the European Union to
bail us out," he said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the new health care law, saying it has to be
repealed or it will bankrupt both large and small businesses across
the country. And he tried to rally the room full of GOP base voters
to stay in the fight -- despite the mudslinging -- through November.
</P>
<P>
Rove said veterans inspire him to keep going.
</P>
<P>
"What about those of us who live in comfortable surroundings?"
he said. "Can we not make it our responsibility to influence those
in power? Can we make it a responsibility to save this country?"

BARNES &amp;amp;  NOBLE WINS BATTLE OVER BOARD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bookseller Barnes &amp; Noble, after fending off a challenge to
its chairman, can now focus on a turnaround and a sale.
</P>
<P>
The company still has a large number of shareholders who
question its strategy, but it won some breathing space Tuesday
after shareholders backed its three candidates for the board,
including its chairman, Leonard S. Riggio, over a slate led by the
investor Ronald W. Burkle.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary tally showed that about 44 percent of the shares
voted for the Barnes &amp; Noble slate, while 38 percent voted for the
candidates named by Burkle's investment firm, the Yucaipa Cos.
Shareholders also rejected a proposal by Yucaipa to remove a
poison-pill plan aimed at limiting Burkle's holdings to under 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
The results came after months of bitter public fighting between
the two sides, punctuated by sharply worded accusations of greed
and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
Riggio and the company criticized Burkle as an opportunist who
sought a stealth takeover of the company. Burkle argued that the
Riggio family had failed to prepare Barnes &amp; Noble for digital
books and had used the company to profit at shareholders' expense.
</P>
<P>
"I feel great, and I feel relieved," Riggio said after the
meeting. "It's been a long four to five months."
</P>
<P>
Burkle, who was not at the shareholder meeting, said in a
telephone interview that he would now press Barnes &amp; Noble
management to support the highest bid that emerges from the sales
process. He indicated that he was leaning against making a bid of
his own.
</P>
<P>
Since Barnes &amp; Noble put itself up for sale in August, about 20
companies have expressed interest in making preliminary bids, which
are due in October, according to people briefed on the process.
</P>
<P>
Riggio said that had he lost the proxy contest, potential
bidders could have walked away from the process. It was not clear
whether Riggio might bid for the company, though the people briefed
on the process said that he might eventually partner with a
promising suitor.
</P>
<P>
And while Riggio won Tuesday's board battle, he still has a war
on his hands.
</P>
<P>
Burkle showed no signs of easing up his criticism of the
bookseller's management, saying that the failure of its director
candidates to win the votes of at least 50 percent of outstanding
shares was "pretty pathetic."
</P>
<P>
He argued that he faced a tremendous challenge in competing
against Riggio, management and employees, who as a group were able
to vote about 31.5 percent of the total shares and own more than
that. Burkle owns about 19 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
Burkle added that he remained proud of changes that took place
during his challenge, including the appointment of a new chief
executive, William Lynch, earlier this year.

'Still Here' should take a hike -- it's a bore


      By Tom Long


      Detroit News Film Critic
</P>
<P>
It doesn't really matter whether Joaquin Phoenix is playing a
role or being himself in the perhaps-faux documentary "I'm Still
Here."
</P>
<P>
Either way his character is obnoxious and the film is mostly a
bore.
</P>
<P>
Phoenix ("Gladiator," " Walk the Line") announced a few
years back that he was quitting acting to become a hip-hop
musician. Then he famously showed up on "Late Night with David
Letterman" sporting a long beard and hair and acting
semi-comatose.
</P>
<P>
When news leaked that Casey Affleck, Phoenix's brother-in-law,
was shooting a film documenting Phoenix's transformation, rumors
began swirling that the whole thing was a put-on.
</P>
<P>
That seems to be the truth, since both Affleck and Phoenix take
writing credits on "I'm Still Here." Beyond that, it's hard to
conceive of anyone releasing a real self-portrait this negative.
</P>
<P>
Phoenix is seen cavorting with prostitutes, viciously berating
assistants, taking copious amounts of drugs and rambling
incoherently. In fact, he rarely rambles coherently, and most of
what he says makes him sound like a spoiled, arrogant jerk.
</P>
<P>
Of course, this is probably just the character; but who wants to
watch a spoiled, arrogant jerk even if it is just a character?
</P>
<P>
If the entire enterprise is supposed to say something about the
American preoccupation with celebrity or the decadence of show
business brats, well, those already overdone subjects have been
covered better elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
And by the way, if Phoenix is actually retiring from acting for
a music career, he's bound for disaster. The guy has no discernable
talent and he's terrible on stage.
</P>
<P>
But chances are the joke is on us. The problem is the joke isn't
very funny. In fact, it's kind of vile.

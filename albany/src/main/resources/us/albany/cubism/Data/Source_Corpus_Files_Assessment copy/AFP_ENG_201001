Golf: Game maker Electronic Arts sticks with Woods
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 4, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Electronic Arts Incorporated is sticking with embattled golfer Tiger Woods and
plans to roll out an online game featuring the world number one this month.
</P>
<P>
EA Sports President Peter Moore said Woods is "still one of the greatest
athletes in history" despite the personal scandal that enveloped Woods at the
end of 2009.
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship with Tiger has always been rooted in golf," Moore wrote on a
company blog on Monday. "We didn't form a relationship with him so that he could
act as an arm's length endorser.
</P>
<P>
Moore also noted EA's extensive work over the past year in developing the new
game, "Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online."
</P>
<P>
EA wouldn't comment on whether plans for a new edition of the popular "Tiger
Woods PGA Tour" console game would be affected.
</P>
<P>
US telecoms giant AT&amp;T and Accenture, the Dublin-based technology,
management and outsourcing consultancy, both dropped their sponsorships of Woods
in December.
</P>
<P>
Their moves came after Woods was embroiled in a sex scandal, admitted cheating
on his wife and decided to take an indefinite break from competitive golf.
</P>
<P>
Other sponsors - Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer and razor-blade giant Gillette -
have stopped using his image for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Sports equipment giant Nike, which pays Woods an estimated 40 million dollars a
year, has issued unqualified support for Woods.

White House backs 'free Internet' in Google-China dispute
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
washington, Jan 13, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Google threatening to pull out of China over censorship, the White House
said Wednesday that it backs the "right to a free Internet" and confirmed it has
held talks with the Internet giant.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said he would not go into details about the
administration's discussions with Google, which announced on Tuesday it would no
longer filter search results from China on its Web search engine.
</P>
<P>
"We have had conversations and discussions with them about what they have talked
about yesterday," Gibbs told reporters here. "I don't want to get much further
afield than that."
</P>
<P>
"The president and this administration have beliefs about the freedom of the
Internet," Gibbs added, noting that President Barack Obama had expressed them in
China last year.
</P>
<P>
"The right of a free Internet is what many of you heard the president talk about
in China," Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to China in November, Obama pushed for an unshackled Internet
saying he was a "strong supporter of open Internet use" and a "big supporter of
non-censorship."
</P>
<P>
Gibbs also recalled that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had asked for an
explanation from China for what Google said was a wave of "highly sophisticated"
cyberattacks aimed at Chinese human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
"As the secretary of state said, we look forward to the response from the
Chinese," the White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
China said Wednesday it was seeking more information on Google's move.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Xinhua news agency quoted an anonymous official at the press
office of the State Council, the nation's cabinet, as saying that Internet
authorities were looking for clarification of Google's statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is still hard to say whether Google will quit China or not. Nobody knows,"
the official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Google said China-based cyber spies struck the Internet giant and at least 20
other unidentified firms in an apparent bid to hack into the email accounts of
Chinese human rights activists around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Mountain View, California-based company, whose motto is "Don't be evil,"
said the cyberattacks originating from China and Web censorship demands were
forcing it to review its business operations in China.
</P>
<P>
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised Google on Wednesday for
threatening to quit China and urged other high-tech companies to resist Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The announcement that Google will fully review its business operations in China
and will no longer tolerate censorship of its search engine should serve as an
example to businesses and governments," Pelosi said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government operates one of the most sophisticated operations in the
world to control the Internet," Pelosi said. "It is essential that technology
companies not assist in efforts that violate human rights or prohibit the free
exchange of ideas."
</P>
<P>
A Republican member of Congress, Chris Smith of New Jersey, urged Pelosi on
Wednesday to bring the Global Online Freedom Act, a bill that would prevent US
IT companies from working with repressive governments, to a vote.
</P>
<P>
Smith praised Google's move and said "legislation is desperately needed to stop
US companies from working hand-in-glove with dictatorships attempting to crack
down on democratic activists who use the Internet."
</P>
<P>
Paris-based Reporters Without Borders hailed Google's move meanwhile saying "a
foreign IT company has finally accepted its responsibilities towards Chinese
users and is standing up to the Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
"We call on other IT companies to form a common front and we urge the Chinese
authorities to reconsider their position," RSF said.

Crew, passengers fret about future of Japan Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo, Jan 19, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Passengers and crew of Japan Airlines clung to hopes a revamped carrier would
spread its wings again as the company went bust Tuesday in an emblematic
illustration of the nation's economic decline.
</P>
<P>
A once iconic airline synonymous with top-notch service that symbolised Japan's
post-war renaissance, the debt-laden carrier filed for protection from creditors
and is set to lay off more than 15,600 employees.
</P>
<P>
For many Japanese, the airline's rise and fall is a saga as emotionally charged
as the television series in the early 1980s that depicted a JAL air hostess's
gruelling training to perfect her skills.
</P>
<P>
"I've always flown Japan Airlines since I was very young, so it is unfortunate
that its image has been damaged in this way," said 59-year-old Kuniaki Fujiwara
as he stepped off a JAL flight at Tokyo's Haneda Airport.
</P>
<P>
"Its presence was like a dream and it symbolised Japan's rebirth from the ashes
of war," he added, recalling his first flight in the early 1960s, around the
time the Beatles first arrived to fanfare on a JAL flight to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"But it has been having so many problems for so many years that I think it was
inevitable for (the bankruptcy) to happen. I hope and I pray that a new JAL will
fly again and keep its name," said Fujiwara.
</P>
<P>
With the trademark crane logo on its wings, JAL rapidly widened its operations
at home and abroad after its creation in 1951, at one stage becoming the world's
largest carrier in terms of regular flights.
</P>
<P>
Now, with estimated debts of two trillion yen (22 billion dollars), its
bankruptcy is Japan's biggest outside the financial sector since World War II.
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked at the news. Its presence was so large that it's hard to imagine,"
said 23-year-old Yukiko Nishii, who said she had once applied for a job at JAL
as an air hostess before becoming a bank employee instead.
</P>
<P>
"Every woman has dreamed at least once in her lifetime of being a JAL flight
attendant," she said. "But now that I think about it, it's scary to think what
would have happened if I had accepted the job."
</P>
<P>
But even as shares of Japan Airlines dived and the company headed for
bankruptcy, it was business as usual at Haneda Airport, where employees
continued to serve customers with a smile.
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old JAL female employee who joined the company during the worst of
Japan's recession early last year said that her superiors had not yet spoken to
regular staff about the company's prospects.
</P>
<P>
"We were told to believe in the company, so despite what the media are
reporting, I've chosen to have faith in the company," she said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"A job at JAL was really a dream job. It's a company where women thought they
could shine. It had the image of being very glamorous, but the reality is
different," she said, smiling apologetically.
</P>
<P>
Despite its privatisation in 1987, JAL has often come under political pressure
to maintain regular flights to more than half of Japan's domestic airports, even
though many routes are unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
But for 43-year-old Hideharu Seiyama, from Shimane prefecture in western Japan,
those flights are crucial because JAL is the only airline to service them.
</P>
<P>
"I will really be in trouble if services are stopped," he said. "Even if it
changes its name, I hope it will keep flying those routes."

N.Ireland party holds key talks on power-sharing deal
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BELFAST, Jan 23, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the parties in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, Sinn Fein,
held a key meeting Saturday which could determine the future of the strained
administration in the British province.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein accuse their pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) partners of
blocking a deal on the devolution of policing and justice powers, one of the
crucial pieces in the devolution of powers from London to Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the Unionists had derailed talks on
the issue by demanding concessions on controls over controversial Protestant
Orange Order parades.
</P>
<P>
But DUP leader Peter Robinson, still reeling from a sex and money scandal
involving his politician wife, said progress was being made in the negotiations
and claimed Sinn Fein were stirring up an unnecessary political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's leadership met in Dublin, with the party's ruling executive expected
to announce their next move later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
There were fears that Sinn Fein -- who want a united Ireland -- may carry out
their threat of withdrawing from the power-sharing government unless they can
reach a deal on the vexed issue of policing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago Sinn Fein backed the new policing arrangements in Northern
Ireland on condition that the province's Assembly eventually took over political
responsibility for law and order from London.
</P>
<P>
But Robinson, who is the province's top minister, insists that the conditions
must be right before powers are transferred, and Sinn Fein has grown frustrated
at the stand-off.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the meeting, Sinn Fein vice-president Mary Lou McDonald said: "We have
said all along that we are in this to make the St Andrew's Agreement come into
effect to ensure the institutions work -- that is the Sinn Fein position.
</P>
<P>
"But this needs to be dialogue with a purpose, there needs to be product at the
end of it."
</P>
<P>
There is a possibility that Sinn Fein could announce the resignation of Martin
McGuinness as deputy first minister, or threaten he will withdraw by a specified
date unless policing and justice is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Another option is to appeal for the British and Irish governments to intervene
in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Robinson meanwhile is fighting allegations that he was aware that his wife Iris
had secured a 50,000 pound (80,000 dollar, 57,000 euro) donation to enable her
19-year-old lover to set up a restaurant business.
</P>
<P>
Three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland were largely ended by
the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, but two British soldiers and a policeman were
shot dead last year in attacks claimed by dissident republicans.

Britain 'appalled' by Iran hangings
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, Jan 28, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain said Thursday it was "appalled" by the reported hanging of two men in
Iran convicted of being Mohareb (enemies of God), the first executions of
dissidents since post-election protests.
</P>
<P>
"I am appalled by reports that Mohammad Reza Ali Zamani and Arash Rahmani Pour
were hanged this morning in Iran," said Foreign Secretary David Miliband.
</P>
<P>
"The trials and now these subsequent executions undermine Iran's claimed
commitment to justice, human rights and democratic values."
</P>
<P>
Their executions were the first reported hangings of people tried after the wave
of protests that broke out following the disputed June 12 re-election of
hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
</P>
<P>
Miliband praised the determination of protestors, saying they showed "the
strength of desire for democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms amongst
ordinary Iranians."
</P>
<P>
"These latest executions appear to be politically motivated and yet another
attempt by the regime to silence dissent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I call on the Iranian Government to meet the human rights obligations to which
it is committed."
</P>
<P>
As well as convictions for being enemies of God, the pair were also charged with
plotting to topple the Islamic regime, ISNA news agency said, quoting the Tehran
prosecutor's office.

US security rules likely to harm ties with Nigeria: government

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New US security restrictions on air passengers from Nigeria are likely to harm
ties between the two countries, the government in Abuja warned on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria "views this action as having the potential of undermining long-standing
and established US-Nigeria bilateral ties and the goodwill the US enjoys in
Nigeria," a statement released after a cabinet meeting said.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria expresses its disappointment and concern over the undeserved placement
of Nigeria on the countries-of-interest list," said the statement read out to
reporters by Information Minister Dora Akunyili.
</P>
<P>
Washington on Sunday introduced new security measures for passengers flying to
the United States from 14 countries, after a 23-year-old Nigerian was accused of
trying to blow up a US jetliner over Detroit on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a trained mechanical engineer, who had explosives
sewn into his underwear, had boarded a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam
to Detroit. He had flown to Amsterdam on a KLM flight from Lagos.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria has since December 25 expressed its deep sorrow and dismay over the
incident which it condemned in all its ramifications," the statement said.

Charges against Uzbek photographer 'absurd': HRW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Almaty, Jan 29, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charges brought against a prominent Uzbek photographer that have her facing
three years in prison are absurd and should be dropped, leading rights group
Human Rights Watch said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Umida Akhmedova, Uzbekistan's most prominent female photographer, says she was
charged after a collection of her photographs and a film were declared
"slanderous" over their portrayal of life in the isolated ex-Soviet state.
</P>
<P>
"The charges against Umida Akhmedova reveal the absurd lengths the government
will go to to silence independent expression," Holly Cartner, Europe and Central
Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The case sets a dangerous precedent and is a threat to all Uzbek artists."
</P>
<P>
The charges -- "slander with selfish ends or vile motives" -- carry a maximum
sentence of three years in jail in Uzbekistan, a frequent target of criticism
from rights groups.
</P>
<P>
The Uzbek prosecutor general's office, meanwhile, has denied opening a criminal
case against Akhmedova.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Tashkent rarely comment on elements of criminal cases to the
press, and deflect criticism of their tough policing methods as necessary to
protect the state against Islamist groups in the volatile region.
</P>
<P>
The works -- a book of more than 100 photographs of rural life titled "Woman and
Man: From Dawn till Night," and a documentary film about women's rights -- dealt
with topics sensitive for the government, which carefully guards its image
abroad.
</P>
<P>
HRW blasted the conclusions of an expert panel convened by the government to
analyze Akhmedova's work, excerpts of which were published in Russia's leading
opposition newspaper, Novaya Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
In chilling language echoing the world of Soviet art criticism, the panel
concluded that the "photo album does not conform to aesthetic demands" and that
it would damage the country's "spiritual values".
</P>
<P>
"It is not the role of the Uzbek government to dictate how artists should depict
Uzbek society," Cartner said.

Two Koreas trade fire, Pyongyang vows no let up
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SEOUL, Jan 27, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North and South Korea traded artillery fire near their disputed sea border
Wednesday and Pyongyang vowed to press on with live firing exercises, ratcheting
up tensions anew between the Cold War foes.
</P>
<P>
"Such firing drill by the units of the KPA will go on in the same waters in the
future," the (North) Korean People's Army General Staff said in a statement,
hours after its first exercise at the flashpoint border sparked an exchange of
fire between the two militaries.
</P>
<P>
South Korea condemned the North's artillery fire as "a gravely provocative act"
and warned it would respond sternly to future provocations.
</P>
<P>
North Korean land artillery batteries fired about 30 shells over more than an
hour into the sea north of the disputed west coast borderline, Seoul officials
said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Marines on a nearby island responded by firing about 100 warning
shots from Vulcan cannons.
</P>
<P>
No casualties or damage were reported but the incident further raised tensions
along the sea border, the scene of deadly naval clashes in 1999 and 2002. The
latest firefight in the area on November 10 left a North Korean patrol boat in
flames.
</P>
<P>
The North's army said it had staged an annual artillery live firing drill in its
own waters with which "no one can argue".
</P>
<P>
The drill came a day after the communist North declared two "no sail zones"
around the borderline, which has been a persistent flashpoint since it was drawn
up by United Nations forces after the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
The North refuses to accept the line and says it should run further to the
south.
</P>
<P>
"There is only the extension of the Military Demarcation Line recognised by the
DPRK (North Korea)..." its military statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two nations have remained technically at war since their conflict ended
without a formal peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
South Korea called an emergency meeting of security and other ministers.
</P>
<P>
A senior South Korean military officer told a briefing that Seoul would have
counter-attacked rather than just firing warning shots had the North's shells
landed in the South's waters, Yonhap news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The North committed a gravely provocative act by declaring no-sail zones in the
Yellow Sea in breach of the (Korean War) armistice and the inter-Korean non-
aggression pact," Seoul's defence ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We expressed grave concerns over the North's threatening behaviour and demanded
an immediate halt to all such activities."
</P>
<P>
The protest was contained in a message sent to the North's side.
</P>
<P>
"The military will strongly react to any provocative acts by the North and all
the responsibility for consequences will rest with the Northern side," the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Baek Seung-Joo, of the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses, said before the
North's latest announcement that Pyongyang would probably persist with its
current strategy for some time.
</P>
<P>
"North Korea will likely continue such low-intensity military provocations like
this in the next few months," Baek told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"But it is unlikely to take things to the extreme, as in general it wants to
maintain economic cooperation with South Korea."
</P>
<P>
The sanctions-hit North has sent mixed messages to its neighbour in recent
months. It is pressing to upgrade or restart joint business projects with the
South, while its military at the same time has issued threats of war.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang also demands talks with the United States on a formal peace treaty
before returning to nuclear disarmament negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The November clash broke out when a North Korean patrol boat crossed the border
and refused to turn back despite warnings, according to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The firefight left the North's boat retreating in flames and one South Korean
craft with bullet holes in its hull. There was no information on North Korean
casualties, while the South's crewmen were unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Last month the North warned South Korean ships to avoid the border area, saying
its coastal artillery would stage firing exercises in response to "reckless
military provocations".
</P>
<P>
On Sunday the military lashed out at South Korea's vow to launch a preemptive
strike to thwart any nuclear attack, calling it "an open declaration of war".

Football: Juve fans continue to bait Balotelli
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Rome, Jan 17, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Juventus fans continued their campaign of abuse against Inter Milan striker
Mario Balotelli during Sunday's match away to Chievo in Verona.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week Juve were hit with a partial stadium closure due to chants of
a racial nature their fans directed at Balotelli, an Italian of Ghanaian origin,
in previous matches.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time this season that Juve had been punished for racial chants,
although previously they were hit only with fines.
</P>
<P>
This time around their south stand, from where the majority of the chants tend
to originate, has been closed for their next Serie A home game against Roma next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Last season they were forced to play one match behind closed doors due to racist
chants against the same player during their home match against Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
The chants during Sunday's game were not racial in nature but the continued
targetting of Balotelli, who is black, has ensured racism remains a hot topic in
Italian football circles.
</P>
<P>
Juve were previously punished when fans chanted: "There are no black Italians",
while Sunday's chorus consisted of: "If you jump up and down, Balotelli will
die".
</P>
<P>
Teenager Balotelli is a divisive figure in Italian football largely due to his
occasionally impetuous on-field behaviour.
</P>
<P>
However, the forward is also considered one of the country's brightest young
talents and many commentators are clamouring for him to be included in Italy's
World Cup for South Africa in June.
</P>
<P>
Balotelli's parents are Ghanaian immigrants and he was born in Palermo on the
island of Sicily before being fostered to an Italian family when he was three.
</P>
<P>
His birth-parents' surname is Barwuah but he uses the surname of his adoptive
parents.

British PM 'appalled' by planned Islamist march
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, Jan 4, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Monday he was "appalled" at a planned march by
Islamists through the town where Britain's Afghanistan war dead are repatriated,
branding it "abhorrent and offensive".
</P>
<P>
The group Islam4UK wants to commemorate the Muslim civilians killed in the
conflict with a march through Wootton Bassett in southwest England, where
hundreds of people regularly gather to pay their respects to dead British
soldiers as their coffins pass through the main street.
</P>
<P>
Although no date has been set, the suggestion of such a protest, in a place that
has come to symbolise public respect for the war dead, has caused uproar.
</P>
<P>
"I am personally appalled by the prospect of a march in Wootton Bassett," Brown
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we as a nation should honour those brave servicemen and women
who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.
</P>
<P>
"Wootton Bassett has a special significance for us all at this time, as it has
been the scene of the repatriation of many members of our armed forces who have
tragically fallen.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to use this location to cause further distress and suffering to
those who have lost loved ones would be abhorrent and offensive."
</P>
<P>
Anjem Choudary, the leader of Islam4UK, admitted that choosing Wootton Bassett
was designed to gain publicity.
</P>
<P>
"We need to gain media attention in order to highlight the plight of the
ordinary men, women and children who are being mercilously murdered in
Afghanistan," he told Sky News television.
</P>
<P>
A total of 108 British soldiers died in Afghanistan in 2009 compared to 2,038
civilians in the first 10 months of the year, according to the United Nations
mission in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Choudary also praised Al-Qaeda terror network chief Osama bin Laden, who he said
was hugely popular and would win any election in the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Islam4UK calls itself a platform for Al-Muhajiroun, a radical group now
disbanded which used to be headed by Omar Bakri, an Islamist preacher barred
from Britain for his views.
</P>
<P>
Separately, seven Muslim men appeared in court in Luton, north of London, on
Monday charged in connection with protests at a homecoming parade in March 2009
for British soldiers who served in Iraq and Aghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The court heard how the men told the soldiers to "burn in hell" and branded them
rapists, murderers and baby killers.
</P>
<P>
Jalal Ahmed, 21, Yousaf Bashir, 29, Jubair Ahmed, 19, Ziaur Rahman, 32,
Shajjadar Choudhury, 31, Munim Abdul, 28, and Ibrahim Anderson, 32, all from
Luton, deny using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour likely to
cause harassment, alarm or distress.

UN rights chief urges Uganda to scrap anti-gay bill

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UN rights chief Navi Pillay on Friday urged the Ugandan government to scrap an
anti-homosexuality bill which is to be put before parliament, saying that it was
"blatantly discriminatory."
</P>
<P>
"The bill clearly breaches international human rights standards, as it is
blatantly discriminatory," said Pillay in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, which has been harshly condemned by the United States and
European Union, would impose the death penalty for "aggravated homosexuality",
applicable in cases of rape of a minor by a person of the same sex, or where one
partner carries the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
It would also criminalise public discussion of homosexuality and could penalise
an individual who knowingly rents property to a homosexual.
</P>

"The bill proposes draconian punishments for people alleged to be lesbian, gay,
bisexual or transgendered," the High Commissioner for Human Rights said.
</P>
<P>
"It is extraordinary to find legislation like this being proposed more than 60
years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ... made
it clear this type of discrimination is unacceptable," she added.
</P>
<P>
Calling on Uganda to "shelve (the) draconian draft bill," Pillay warned that the
bill could seriously hurt the country's reputation.
</P>
<P>
"To criminalise people on the basis of colour or gender is now unthinkable in
most countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The same should apply to an individual's sexual orientation. International
human rights standards strongly suggest that the state should not dictate the
nature of private consensual relations between adults," she added.

2009, a year of 'serious abuses' for Egypt and Libya: HRW
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Egypt must revoke its "draconian emergency law" and Libya should free unjustly
detained prisoners, Human Rights Watch said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Both Egypt's and Libya's human rights records will come under intense
scrutiny by the UN Human Rights Council in 2010," said Sarah Leah Whitson,
Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
Whitson was in Cairo to present the world report review of countries in the
Middle East, entitled "Egypt and Libya: A Year of Serious Abuses" which details
the state of human rights in 2009.
</P>
<P>
"Egyptian security services need to understand that their thuggery confirms the
international image of Egypt as a police state, while Libyan security forces
continue to dominate political space in Libya in an atmosphere of fear," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She called on Egypt to repeal the emergency law and revamp it security services.
</P>
<P>
The government has "broken its promises (to end the emergency law) over and over
again to its shame and discredit," Whitson said, adding that torture and abuse
in Egypt were "pervasive".
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been operating under a state of emergency since the 1981 assassination
of president Anwar Sadat, and it has been renewed repeatedly since then despite
protests from rights groups and regime opponents.
</P>
<P>
HRW also called on the Libyan government to "immediately release unjustly
detained prisoners, reveal the fate of disappeared prisoners, provide justice to
the families of victims of the killings of 1,200 inmates in 1996 in Abu Salim
prison and reform laws that criminalise free speech and association."

German 'tyrant' ad banned in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON, Jan 19, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A radio advertisement for a British recruitment website has been banned for
implying that Germans are tyrants, a watchdog said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement for Reed showed a man speaking to his boss, who answered
furiously in German. A voiceover then said: "Boss a bit of a tyrant? Find your
perfect boss on the UK's biggest job site."
</P>
<P>
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ordered Reed not to show the
advertisement again in its current form after receiving 13 complaints from
members of the public.
</P>
<P>
"The humour derived from a stereotype at the expense of German people. We
considered that the portrayal suggested that German people were more likely to
be unreasonable or aggressive to others," the ASA said.
</P>
<P>
"The ad reinforced a negative and outdated cultural stereotype of German people
as overpowering and tyrannical and therefore the ad had the potential to cause
serious offence to some listeners."

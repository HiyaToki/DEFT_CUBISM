Iran opposition leader recognizes Ahmadinejad

<P>
The son of a top Iranian opposition leader says his father now recognizes Iran's president as the head of the government, while still maintaining that his June re-election was fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi Karroubi's son Hossein said Monday that his father now recognizes President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad despite the fraud in the election.
</P>
<P>
Karroubi's new position is a major retreat from his earlier fiery denunciations of Ahmadinejad's government as illegitimate. The move could signal an attempt to reach a settlement with the clerics within the ruling system.
</P>
<P>
He has refrained from describing Ahmadinejad as "president," however, in order not to give full legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The opposition says at least 80 protesters have been killed in the postelection turmoil.

Carroll ready for Seattle challenge
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SEATTLE 2010-01-12 14:51:13 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Seattle coach Pete Carroll says he loves challenges and the Seahawks, who pried him from Southern California and back into the NFL, will provide one of the biggest in the league right now.
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks are in their worst two-year stretch since 1992-93, with just nine wins in 32 games since their most recent playoff appearance. They don't have a general manager. They don't have a president. They don't have a swagger, flair, long tradition of excellence or much of anything else USC had for nine, mostly glorious years under Carroll.
</P>
<P>
They have a 34-year-old quarterback, Matt Hasselbeck, who just played through broken ribs, a bad throwing shoulder and a banged-up thumb to set a career high in interceptions -- and that was after his 2008 was ruined by a bad back. They have a passed-over, seventh-round draft choice as their most dynamic rusher.
</P>
<P>
They have an owner, Microsoft tycoon Paul Allen, for whom money is no limitation and losing has no excuse. He fired coach Jim Mora on Friday after only one season.
</P>
<P>
And now they have a new coach who will have football "operating duties," according to Seahawks CEO Tod Leiweke, with whom Carroll struck a deal to become the eighth coach in the Seahawks' 34-year history. Carroll signed the contract Monday and was to be introduced by the Seahawks at their luxurious, lakeside headquarters Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"What this next step presents is the opportunity of a lifetime, in the most challenging of settings," the charismatic, 58-year-old Carroll said Monday during his farewell address at USC.
</P>
<P>
"It was such an obvious opportunity of different proportions."
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks sold Carroll on added responsibilities equivalent to a vice president of football operations. Carroll will work alongside whomever Seattle eventually hires as its new GM on operations beyond just coaching.
</P>
<P>
Leiweke said Monday night Carroll's additional duties will include organizing the Seahawks' calendar and travel, among other things beyond mere X's and O's.
</P>
<P>
The idea is to build a far more harmonious relationship than the fractured one that existed between former coach Mike Holmgren, who was also Seattle's GM from 1999-2002, and GM and president Tim Ruskell, whom the Seahawks forced to resign last month at the end of a 5-11 season.
</P>
<P>
It is far more say in football operations than Carroll had in his one season as coach of the New York Jets in 1994, and in his stint as coach of New England from 1997-99. It is more than Atlanta or Miami could offer in recent winters, when Carroll at least thought about returning to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would be here forever," Carroll said at USC Monday, "and this thing came along. And it's an opportunity that I just can't pass up.
</P>
<P>
"The is THE unique opportunity. ... You know how I have looked at that over the years: there was never an opportunity. I'm just attracted to the aspect of this whole thing."
</P>
<P>
This "whole thing" is believed to be for five years at a salary as rich or richer annually than any coach in the league. That would mean $6 million per season or more.
</P>
<P>
Carroll's agent, Gary Uberstine, wrote in an e-mail to The Associated Press on Monday night, "Our firm policy is not to comment on clients' contract details."
</P>
<P>
Trojans offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates -- whom Carroll brought in for 2009 is coming to presumably take the same job in Seattle. Ken Norton Jr., Carroll's linebackers coach at USC, and Trojans offensive line coach Pat Ruel are also expected to be on the new Seahawks staff.
</P>
<P>
Not that the new coach was saying much about that while still in L.A.
</P>
<P>
"We're working at it," Carroll said of which USC coaches are coming with him and which will stay during the final weeks of the recruiting season. "It's a delicate situation with the people I love who I have had long relationships with."
</P>
<P>
There are some of those already awaiting Carroll in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Lawrence Jackson, a recent No. 1 draft choice of the Seahawks, is just two years removed from Carroll's dynasty. And Seahawks three-time Pro Bowl linebacker and co-captain Lofa Tatupu is one of the few USC defenders Carroll cited by name.
</P>
<P>
Yet despite saying he will always be a Trojan, will always return to Southern California and be part of that community, Carroll said Seattle is providing him the NFL experience he's always wanted "at the highest level of competition."
</P>
<P>
"It was about the challenge," Carroll said. "This challenge became greater and just too exciting to pass up."

UN rights body concerned for Haiti ' s children

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N.'s top human rights body has stressed the need to protect children in Haiti following the devastating earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The Human Rights Council's 47 members unanimously passed a resolution Thursday expressing concern about rights abuses in the wake of the quake and urging the government and aid groups to protect children from violence and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of children lost one or both parents in the Jan. 12 disaster.
</P>
<P>
Activist group U.N. Watch has described the council's two-day special session on Haiti as "a harmful waste of the organization's precious time, resources, and moral capital."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Watch says the council "has no budget, authority or expertise on humanitarian aid" and ignores more pressing human rights problems.

Rights group slams treatment of Mideast minorities
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CAIRO 2010-01-26 15:05:53 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A New York-based human rights organization criticized the governments of five Middle Eastern countries Tuesday, including close U.S.-allies Jordan and Saudi Arabia, for their treatment of women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
Human Rights Watch released the chapters of its 2010 World Report that deal with Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen, accusing them of poor treatment of women, minorities and refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Middle Eastern governments need to recognize that the rights of minorities, refugees, and stateless persons need greater protections," the group's Middle East director, Sarah Leah Whitson, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The release of these latest chapters of the annual report follows Sunday's description of the post-election crackdown in Iran and the mistreatment of migrant workers in the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The chapters described a pattern of discrimination against minorities in the region, including Saudi Arabia's treatment of its 2 million-strong Shiite population and Syria's repression of its Kurds.
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, the report criticized the living conditions of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees, while asserting that the Yemeni government committed violations in its battle with Shiite rebels in the north.
</P>
<P>
Tensions with Shiites in Saudi Arabia reached new heights in 2009 when clashes between Shiite pilgrims and security guards in the city of Medina resulted in scores of arrests. At least one Shiite mosque was closed down in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The report did note that King Abdullah had replaced conservatives in the religious establishment and judiciary, but saw little overall improvement in human rights, especially for women.
</P>
<P>
"Authorities continue to systematically suppress, or fail to protect, the rights of fourteen million Saudi women and girls," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Just to the south, in Yemen, Human Rights Watch described a severe deterioration in the rule of law as a government facing opposition on several fronts arrested journalists and activists.
</P>
<P>
With a Shiite rebellion in the north and a southern separatist movement, Yemen's government has conducted sweeping arrest campaigns against any suspected sympathizers of either movement, charging many with "contesting the unity of the state."
</P>
<P>
In Syria, meanwhile, a chronically poor rights situation worsened, according to the report, with some 45 people arrested for membership in unauthorized political groups or those with links to the Kurds or Muslim Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the other countries, the report saw no significant decline in the human rights situation in Jordan, though it did note that criticizing the king still carried heavy penalties, and perpetrators of "honor killings" were receiving lenient sentences.
</P>
<P>
So-called honor killings involve slayings of women -- often by male relatives -- for perceived slights to their families' honor, such as accusations of infidelity or of having romantic relationships outside of marriage.

Pat Robertson: Haiti ' cursed '  by pact with devil
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VIRGINIA BEACH, Virginia 2010-01-13 23:48:15 UTC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Evangelical broadcaster Pat Robertson says Haiti has been "cursed" because of what he called a "pact with the devil" in its history.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman said the Wednesday comments were based on Voodoo rituals carried out before a slave rebellion against French colonists in 1791.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Chris Roslan says Robertson never stated that Tuesday's earthquake was God's wrath. He says Robertson's Operation Blessing group is sending millions of dollars in medication and relief workers to the country.
</P>
<P>
Robertson has angered opponents many times before with comments on current events and criticism of other faiths.
</P>
<P>
He once said American agents should assassinate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and said Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's stroke was divine retribution for withdrawing from the Gaza Strip.

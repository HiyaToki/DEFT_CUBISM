<P>
Canada's prime minister on Tuesday gave Prince Charles, heir to the British
throne, two red sweaters and caps worn by Inuit Rangers to take home to his sons
as souvenirs of his visit.
</P>
<P>
"Your Highness, as you know we're very proud of our Rangers and our Rangers
program," Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, flanked by four Rangers in the
drawing room of the governor general's mansion.
</P>
<P>
They are "a great group of people who patrol our vast Arctic territory," he
said, adding the sweaters and caps symbolized Princes William and Harry's
honorary membership in the Arctic guard.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they fit," quipped Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
"One-size fits all," interjected Harper's wife Laureen.
</P>
<P>
The prince and his wife Camilla arrived in Canada on November 2 for a 10-day
visit -- his 15th tour of this former British colony and her first look into her
family's roots.
</P>
<P>
So far during their 10-day trip, they have visited Canada's oldest English
settlement in Cupids, Newfoundland, which celebrates its 400th anniversary next
year, and the home of famed Arctic explorer Captain Robert Bartlett in Brigus.
</P>
<P>
They also toured Vancouver's 2010 Olympic Village and Dundurn Castle in
Hamilton, Ontario, built in 1835 for Camilla's great-great-great-grandfather and
former prime minister of the united Province of Canada, Sir Alan MacNab.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the couple met with Governor General Michaelle Jean, as well as
Canada's opposition leader Michael Ignatieff and Quebec Premier Jean Charest,
who gave them an Inuit sculpture and a collection of Quebec films on DVD.

Boxing: Filipino Pacquiao uses ring to get message across
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manny Pacquiao has made no secret of his political ambitions outside the ring
but dabbling in government isn't the same as taking it on as a full-time career,
says trainer Freddie Roach.
</P>
<P>
Roach said Pacquiao my run for office in his native Philippines, but after the
fighter gets a taste of political life Roach expects him to eventually return to
his boxing roots.
</P>
<P>
"I would love to see him go out on top," Roach said. "The thing is he can fight
for a long time, because his work ethic is so great.
</P>
<P>
"Once he gets into politics and finds out how corrupt it is he will come back to
boxing. He can do more as a boxer than a politician for his countrymen. Although
he's proven me wrong before."
</P>
<P>
Pacquiao faces Miguel Cotto in a World Boxing Organization welterweight title
fight Saturday at the MGM Grand hotel and casino.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the fight will be dangerous for both fighters and Roach said
their plan is to hit Cotto with some big shots from the opening bell.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to tell him the game plan anymore," Roach said. "It is automatic
now. I make moves in training like Cotto makes in the fight. It is like a dance.
He knows exactly what to do in those situations.
</P>
<P>
Roach says they can shake Cotto's confidence by hitting him early.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to start quick. We always start quick anyway.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to show our power in the first round and hit him to remind him of
the punches he took in the (Antonio) Margarito fight.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to go in and start swinging at him we are going to do it
smart. We will walk Cotto into a fight because he follows and when he follows we
will take advantage of that."
</P>
<P>
Roach said if the smaller Pacquiao doesn't have the power to knock Cotto out
then he can wear him down with his superior hand speed and lightning quick feet.
</P>
<P>
"I honestly don't think we are going to knock him out," said Roach. "We are
going to make him quit."
</P>
<P>
"Manny's foot movement and speed is too much for Cotto. That's where the fight
is won in foot speed and that is where Manny excels."
</P>
<P>
After watching hours of tape of Cotto in his most recent fights, Roach predicts
he will do one of two things.
</P>
<P>
"He is going to use his strength and come forward and show us he is a bigger
stronger guy or he is going to try to become a counterpuncher. But you can't
become someone else in an eight-week period. We have a perfect game plan, I
think."

McDonalds goes 'green' in Germany

Berlin, Nov 23, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the crunch climate change summit in Copenhagen fast approaching, even
McDonalds has decided to go green -- at least with its logo, a senior executive
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At German branches of the US fast-food chain, the famous golden arches will be
emblazoned on a green background, rather than its usual red, McDonalds Germany
vice-president Holger Beeck said.
</P>
<P>
The change will be made on all new and refitted restaurants "out of respect for
the environment," Beeck told the Financial Times Deutschland.
</P>
<P>
The instantly recognisable logo is the world's sixth most valuable brand,
according to a 2009 report by Interbrand consultancy, behind only Coca-cola,
IBM, Microsoft, General Electric and Nokia.
</P>
<P>
A study earlier this month showed that McDonalds was the most popular brand for
Germans between the ages of 12 and 18.
</P>
<P>
The December 7-18 Copenhagen talks are aimed at agreeing an international pact
to cut carbon emissions and providing money to poorer nations to transfer green
technology and help them cope with the ravages of climate change.
</P>
<P>
McDonalds has in the past come under fire from environmental groups on several
fronts, including its use of packaging and deforestation.
</P>
<P>
However, environmental campaigners Greenpeace have also praised the company for
efforts to be more environmentally friendly, including introducing refrigerators
without harmful chlorofluorocarbons.

Embattled Vattenfall says to name new CEO soon
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Stockholm, Nov 13, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European energy giant Vattenfall will name a new chief executive soon, the
Swedish company said on Friday, as controversy mounted over its current chief
following a slew of media revelations.
</P>
<P>
"There will be an announcement in due time," Vattenfall spokesman Mark Vadasz
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the board of the Swedish state-owned power company, Lars
Westerberg, meanwhile told news agency TT the announcement "won't be today, but
in a few weeks."
</P>
<P>
Vattenfall's current chief Lars Josefsson has come under increasingly heavy fire
in the Swedish media in recent few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Swedish Enterprise Minister Maud Olofsson criticised
Vattenfall after media reported that it was considering a sale of its Swedish
electricity grid to finance nuclear power investments in Britain, even though
Vattenfall stressed that no decision had been taken yet.
</P>
<P>
And on Thursday she slammed the company's decision to sign a deal with its
German subsidiary taking financial responsibility for its operations in Germany
in the event of a nuclear accident, saying Josefsson was risking the entire
company.
</P>
<P>
"I hope there will be an announcement about a new CEO as soon as possible," she
said Friday, adding "the brand name is badly damaged now."
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, two members of Vattenfall's board -- representatives from the
influential SEKO union of service and communication employees -- resigned,
saying they no longer had faith in the CEO.
</P>
<P>
The union deemed it "impossible to sit on the board and take responsibility for
the company's activities as long as Lars G. Josefsson" is CEO, union president
Janne Ruden said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Despite Westerberg's comments to TT that the announcement of a new chief
executive would be forthcoming, company spokesman Vadasz insisted Josefsson's
replacement had nothing to do with the recent controversy.
</P>
<P>
"There is no connection between what is happening now and the process to find a
new CEO because it has been going on for a long time," Vadasz said, noting that
Josefsson will be eligible for retirement next year.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, Josefsson's pension agreement with Vattenfall is
worth 57 million kronor (8.3 million dollars, 5.6 million euros).

Burundi tensions worsen amid 'militia' claims

<TEXT>
<P>
Burundi's main opposition group massed youths at a weekend rally, warning that
it was preparing to fight fire with fire after accusing the ruling CNDD-FDD of
forming a militia ahead of polls.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of youths drilled in the streets of the central town of Gitega on Sunday
as part of a "sports day" organised by the Front for Democracy in Burundi
(FRODEBU).
</P>
<P>
"The ruling party has for several months been organising massive youth sports
days with the aim of forming a militia to destabilise peace before, during and
after the elections," said FRODEBU's deputy leader, Frederic Banvuginyunvira.
</P>
<P>
He said similar rallies organised by the ruling party featured youths armed with
clubs.
</P>
<P>
"We have begun and we will continue as long as the ruling party does it and
until it understands that it has taken a dangerous road," Banvuginyunvira told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
Gitega governor Selemani Mossi denounced the rally.
</P>
<P>
"What FRODEBU is doing is meant to disrupt public order and security and I will
take the necessary measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
The small central African state is one of the world's poorest and is struggling
to emerge from the effects of a more than a decade of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Last month, four opposition parties expressed concern over the worsening
political climate which they blame on President Pierre Nkurunziza's CNDD-FDD,
accusing it of corruption and forming a militia.

Venezuela denies Israeli charges it is Iran 'base'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Venezuela on Tuesday rejected an Israeli allegation that it has become Iran's
"forward base" in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's foreign ministry slammed what it called "aggression against its
people" after Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon commented on Tehran's
reach in the region, saying Venezuela was its top ally in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were a "sign of the vile, meddling and aggressive attitude" of
Israel, the Venezuelan statement said.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela broke off diplomatic ties with Israel in January 2009.
</P>
<P>
The heated rhetoric comes as Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian
leader Mahmud Abbas prepare for regional visits this month.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president was due to visit Argentina November 16 with a delegation
of Israeli businessmen, Israeli ambassador to Argentina Daniel Gazit said this
week.
</P>
<P>
Peres and President Cristina Kirchner will discuss the "conflict in the Middle
East" and address "Iran's growing influence (in Latin America) and its hate-
filled ideology and intention to obtain nuclear arms," the diplomat said in
Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
Peres will be the first Israeli president to visit Argentina which has the
largest Jewish community in South America at some 300,000.
</P>
<P>
Abbas in turn was due to visit Argentina November 23, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Gazit said Peres would also visit Brazil where Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad is to pay an official visit November 23.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez is on the short list of leaders who support Iran's
nuclear program.

Australia 'deeply disappointed' at Japan whaling mission
</HEADLINE>

Sydney, Nov 20, 2009 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australia said it was "deeply disappointed" after a fleet of Japanese whaling
ships set out to kill hundreds of the giant ocean mammals on their annual hunt.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Peter Garrett urged Japan, which says the killings are for
research purposes, to "swap harpoons for science" and study whales by other
means.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply disappointed that the Japanese Government has again embarked on
its annual hunt to the Southern Ocean," Garrett said in a statement late on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian government has said repeatedly that we do not have to kill
whales to study them."
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace said four whaling ships left Japan for a five-month hunt in the
Southern Ocean, using a loophole in an international moratorium that allows
their killing for lethal "research".
</P>
<P>
Anti-whaling nations led by Australia and New Zealand and environmental groups
including Greenpeace have long attacked the expeditions as cruel and
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
Militant activists have disrupted previous hunts by pursuing the whalers,
leading to a series of angry confrontations involving rancid butter, stink bombs
and, allegedly, ear-piercing sonic weapons.
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists have vowed to harass the ships in coming months using a
futuristic, super-fast powerboat that last year clocked the fastest
circumnavigation of the world on record.

He was suspended for a year and Koki was reprimanded by the Japan Boxing
Commission for urging his brother to fight dirty.

Koki, who won the World Boxing Association light flyweight title in 2006 but has
stepped up to flyweight, stretched his unbeaten record to 22 wins, including 14
KOs.

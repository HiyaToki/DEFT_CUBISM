So let mr get this straight: Obama does not have the freedom of speech to say what he wants to say about Fox News?

That's the beauty of freedom of speech: You can't eloquently state your beliefs, as can the president. Don't you love it? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/redface.gif"/>

You mean Obama expressed an opinion? The president of the United States expressed an opinion? I believe he is within his rights to do so just as much as commentators on Fox News can insinuate that he was born in Kenya.

You can't have your cake and eat it too. Freedom of speech is for everyone, including the president. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_shhh.gif"/>

Seems to me the last time Obama whined about Fox News, people tuned into Fox to see what the hubbub was all about. Their ratings soared and Obama ended up with egg on his face. Strategically it's bound to be a mistake by Obama because the same results are destine to happen.

The ratings for the Obama sympathizing media have followed the same path as Obama's fall from grace, they have lost trust, dignity and all sense of balance. They show the desperation, lack of understanding and shock that the progressive movement went sour with a great percentage of the American people. They also have developed a habit of hurling insults and undermining the average American citizen just for wanting to be involved.

When the President of the United States makes a STATEMENT that a news organization is destructive it is MUCH more than an opinion. It indicates, when taken with all his other open attacks on the News Agency, that he has an agenda and he is trying to silence or curtail the rights of said News Agency to broadcast.

Lets recap shall we? He tried to ban them from the White House, he tried to hurt them several times last year. He has an agenda. He has lost to the people on it and because the other News Agencies rightly saw that if they allowed him to ban Fox they could be next.

He has no authority to attempt to silence the Press, whether he likes them or not. He has no authority to threaten them or to ban them. He has no authority to silence them. If Bush had come out against one of the other News Organizations you Liberal dumb fucks would have shit your pants.

Ohh and Article-15 noting that another program does the same thing just for the supposed other side is quite relevant to THIS thread. And you know it. You are attempting to silence the truth for political expediency. You are the Partisan hack in this case.

Fox news is not even remotely destructive. If it were it would be breaking the law and it is NOT. You know it and more importantly MOST of the Country KNOWS it.

Why?

For years y'all have been bitching about the liberal media and it's influence. Why is it so hard for you to comperhend that the right wing media has it's own negative affect on the country?

RETARD ALERT, retard alert. Bush faced more criticism more personal attacks and more bad press then Obama ever has. And from multiple sources. As President he knew he had no business threatening a News organization. Obama has no clue.

Once again you weasel, Obama has openly threatened a News Organization, he has tried to ban them from the White House. He has no such authority or power. He is violating the 1st Amendment.

If Bush had even remotely done anything close to what Obama has done you RETARDS would have shit a cow and been DEMANDING criminal or Congressional investigations and a stop to it RIGHT NOW.

When the President of the United States makes a STATEMENT that a news organization is destructive it is MUCH more than an opinion.

You don't need to break the law to be "destructive" and Fox News is most certainly destructive, IMO. The POTUS agrees with me. Frankly, I don't blame him for making his remarks and if I were him I would hit back harder. He's free to say whatever the eff he wants and stating an opinion is not an attempt to "silence" them. That's that just hyperbole you are pulling out of your ass. Nothing he says or does is going to "silence them"... they are still free to lie, distort, and spread fear all they want. And that's the problem.

Did Bush calling the liberal media 'destructive' or cry about them being mean to him?

It's pathetic. Seriously. Obama needs to grow a spine - as to the left. The constant whining about the big bad evil Fox is just laughable.

Nah, Bush had his surrogates do that for him.

I assume you have proof of that?

Sorry, no link for you until you start backing your own assertions with links.

That said, I take it you never listened to Rush, Sean, or any of the other major right wing radio hosts during the Bush Admin because if you did you wouldn't be asking such a silly question.

I don't watch a great deal of tv - I certainly don't listen to 'talk radio'. This whole hysteria over the media is pathetic though. Truthfully, I could care less about whether you back it up or not.... I'm not that interested and you're 'source' would be a media link.... I take very little notice of the media - they're notoriously inaccurate. Which is why I joke about people 'backing up' their claims with links to the media. If you could only understand just how stupid that it is, you guys would stop doing it.

Obama thinks the only reason why he isn't still enjoying 60+% approval ratings is a conspiracy by the media and business against him. I think he honestly believes this.

You pulled that strawman straight out your ass, didn't you? Obama knows why his approval isn't 60+%. It's because the fucked up economy the wingnut neocons handed him was a deeper hole to fill than anyone imagined. No problem, he's smart, and he'll have us in much better shape in 2 years.

Fox News is destructive to Obama's Presidency. Problem is Obama thinks his presidency is more important then America or the wants and needs of it's citizens so he tries to rationalize that because his presidency is so important...so historical....then Fox News is a threat.

Obama loves to wrap himself in the flag at the same time he's trashing what it stands for so to allay any guilt or consternation over this hypocrisy he claims his Presidency not only stands for America but IS America.

So in Obama's warped prospective Fox News is destructive to America. This is an obvious Narcissistic indicator.

Sorry folks but if you're paying attention narcissism is what this guy is all about.

I know what he's thinking......... (How dare they criticize me....the most important President in American history!!!!)

LOL

You know his tanking numbers can't possibly be because his agenda sucks and most Americans don't like it

Its gotta be because FOX news, the only right wing news agency out there, isn't falling all over him like the rest of the LSM. FOX news that actually investigates him is to blame.

Seems to me I remember he started a war with FOX when he was first elected.

That didn't turn out very well for the PRez and his possee.

Don't think another war with FOX will turn out any better this time around.

You'd think a Harvard Law Professor would be a little smarter than that. OOPPSS guess not. LOL

good point...there are so many important issues out there, but obama has to use his presidential bully pulpit to repeatedly bash foxnews and right leaning talk shows....

where are all the dems who whine on when nobody is talking about "important" issues....i am going to assume by the silence of the dems in this thread and around the country, that they support obama's comment.

The reason is because he wants to start a public outcry so he can step in and take them over or put them out of business.

Hope he's not holding his breath on that.

He's almost powerless to go against them....and that really urks him to no end. His usual tactic is to sue them but he can't because he can't prove Fox is being discriminatory.

You don't need to break the law to be "destructive" and Fox News is most certainly destructive, IMO. The POTUS agrees with me. Frankly, I don't blame him for making his remarks and if I were him I would hit back harder. He's free to say whatever the eff he wants and stating an opinion is not an attempt to "silence" them. That's that just hyperbole you are pulling out of your ass. Nothing he says or does is going to "silence them"... they are still free to lie, distort, and spread fear all they want. And that's the problem.

I mean, this is perfect liberalism. How UTTERLY self absorbed in one's own vitriol dones one have to be, that just because Fox makes liberals mad, it MUST be as BAD as Al Queda?

"Oh I mean the Nazis killed six million Jews."

Yeah, but but but, Fox News is worse!!!!!!!!!!! <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_snooty.gif"/>

We are talking about an organization that is dedicated to killing innocent people, and HE thinks Fox News is worse because Fox News puts his underwear in a bunch????????

I mean seriously. The self centeredness of that statement is breathtaking.

It should be in put up on a plaque as a great example of how self centered liberals are.

I think it's been pretty clear to anyone who's not living in denial that people who vote Republican tend to dislike being lied to.

How do you explain the usual Dem tactic of exposing the lies of Republican candidates. Could it be they know that "wingnuts" don't like being lied to. Seems left-wingers don't seem to care. That's why people like Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, Barney Frank, Alan Grayson, Ray "School Bus" Nagan, The Clintons, and Barrack Obama keep getting re-elected.

I think this says way more about the self centered nature of liberals.

It reminds me of Nero's dying scene in the 1953 of "Quo Vadis."

When Nero cries, "Their lives will be so plain without me, how can the people stand it?"

That's an insight into the nature of a narcissist. They think the sun rises and sets on them AND THEM ALONE.

So, liberals reveal their nature, in the idea that anyone that disagrees WITH THE ALL HIGH LIBERAL, wants to "destroy America."

Like Nero who can't believe the sun will continue to rise and set without him, Liberals can't believe the country can survive without them.

It's self absorbed narcissism and it's funny to watch!

It isn't Obama's fault people are divided. We could have all followed Obama like obedient sheep.

No, the people DARED to think for themselves. So it's their fault, the nation isn't "one" behind him.

So let mr get this straight: Obama does not have the freedom of speech to say what he wants to say about Fox News?

I guess freedom of speech is only good if you agree with it you partisan hack...

Who on earth said he couldn't say anything?

The point is, as the American president, he's engaged in fear mongering, and straight out lying, attempting to remove freedoms and rights we have. Obama wants to get rid of free speech. It's obvious when he says things like this. He's lying to the american people, instilling fear and suspicion, and trying to convince them to eliminate a freedom and a right by saying it's "bad" for America. He's a piece of filth.

I so wish I could neg rep him into oblivion.

</quote>

Of course it is destructive! The people who clanishly lap up every word on Fox's talkathons do so because they want to see the Obama Administration "destroyed." Which feeds the popularity of Fox, which attracts the advertisers, which is all that matters.

Referring to the last paragraph of your link, my biggest criticism of Fox, ironically, is that it does NOT "[focus] on the critical issues that Americans are concerned about." It focuses on tabloid-esque "stories" which they will squeeze the blood out of until the next non-story comes along to promote its right wing agenda. FoxNews consists of sensationalist entertainment, with "news" injected as fillers.

By that reckoning it should take about 30 years.

You judge them by other NEWS OUTLETS, not some stupid cable channel showing reruns of House!

Try this where you can see Fox News scores CONSISTENTLY WAY HIGHER than the wannabe competition.

Why is it conservatives are having so many kids, but liberals think they are the only ones getting sex?

Talk about a failure in observational skills.

And we don't kill 'em either. We have our babies.

I've often thought that is why liberals are slowly but surely losing the debate on issues. They keep killing their future population with abortions, while we keep having our babies. Generationally. They are doomed.

Lying gets old after a while.

Seems to me that Chris has 'issues' with old white people. That's ageist, and racist. Why is it bad to be racist but ok to be ageist?

There seems to be a lot of double standards with some people....Chris is one of those people. There are others.... I could name a few more but I won't bother.

</quote>

so does Chris's elected official, he's even taken to calling us racists. I knew I had a good reason not to bestow the title of POTUS on him. He's only president of the US of KKKA. and the Wright ilk.

It's more like, if you find it distasteful to do, don't do it, and don't fucking worry what everyone else is doing.

If you do it, you automatically don't find it distasteful, because "he did it too" is not a real defense of that action.

Personally, I could give a fuck, but I'd say that anyone making fun of someone's appearance should post a self-pic, or shut the fuck up.

I said 'fat assed', not 'fat'. Michelle has a big ass.... Personally, I maintain a standard of not joking or making nasty remarks about the children of anyone... including politicians.... It is a pity that so many on the left seem to think a Downs Syndrome child is worthy of being used to ridicule their parent. I find such people to be among the most moronic.... Given the option of spending time with one of them or a Downs Sydrome person, I would take the company of the Downs Syndrome person - they are far more intelligent and worthy of my time.

Well, #1. You're definitely correct. I'm as sleazy as they come.

But besides that point, I have no vested interest in calling out (whoever that name is you're trying to say).

I'm here for the shear entertainment of pushing Conservative message-board people's buttons. That wouldn't do anything to serve that purpose, and so I determined that it's a waste of time. It's not that serious, Willow. Don't make me call Mad Martigan.

So it's gonna be ok for me to make a crack now about the Obama kids and the likelihood of them being fat assed, like their Mom or would that be racist? Just trying to get the boundaries to all this. Cuz I keep hearing, particularly from the left, that we should leave the Obama kids alone.... and yet, y'all seem to have a problem implementing that with Palin's kids. Interesting dichotomy.

I didn't know that Michelle Obama was fat, but you just did what you asked if it was hypothetically ok to do, so you're cool with it regardless now.

</quote>

I said 'fat assed', not 'fat'. Michelle has a big ass.... Personally, I maintain a standard of not joking or making nasty remarks about the children of anyone... including politicians.... It is a pity that so many on the left seem to think a Downs Syndrome child is worthy of being used to ridicule their parent. I find such people to be among the most moronic.... Given the option of spending time with one of them or a Downs Sydrome person, I would take the company of the Downs Syndrome person - they are far more intelligent and worthy of my time.

They have a different meaning, but when you don't know the spelling difference it doesn't necessarily mean you don't know the meaning of the fucking word you're using, idiot, it means you don't know the spelling difference. Jesus Christ.

They have a different meaning, but when you don't know the spelling difference it doesn't necessarily mean you don't know the meaning of the fucking word you're using, idiot, it means you don't know the spelling difference. Jesus Christ.

Even your jokes and nasty remarks are childish and stupid. You're prertty worthless, dear.

</quote>

Let's review.... was it Willow Tree who gloated over the death of a loved one of another poster? Hmmmm. No. That was you, fat ass. So for you to criticize anyone else for 'nasty remarks' is beyond hypocrisy. Even more impressive, you then go on to compound it by calling me a 'spinster'.... You must be very proud of your ignorance - I see no evidence that you make any effort to remedy it.

You're a funny fat assed old thing, Rin. Seriously.

</quote>

You're always singing the same song. Do you realize that you have a constant pity party going on here?? It's very unattractive. If you can't get a man, move on to something else. Don't call other people names and lie about them because you're angry. I never gloated over anybody's death and I am not fat. You have never seen me. Why do you make up stories?? Get help. Seriously.

So it's gonna be ok for me to make a crack now about the Obama kids and the likelihood of them being fat assed, like their Mom or would that be racist? Just trying to get the boundaries to all this. Cuz I keep hearing, particularly from the left, that we should leave the Obama kids alone.... and yet, y'all seem to have a problem implementing that with Palin's kids. Interesting dichotomy.

It's more like, if you find it distasteful to do, don't do it, and don't fucking worry what everyone else is doing.

Translation for that is, He's admitting, Willow, that you nailed him for his hypocrisy, but like the kid I caught trying to steal my bike once, he's running away and yelling, "You don't know where I live!"

Well, #1. You're definitely correct. I'm as sleazy as they come.

But besides that point, I have no vested interest in calling out (whoever that name is you're trying to say).

I'm here for the shear entertainment of pushing Conservative message-board people's buttons. That wouldn't do anything to serve that purpose, and so I determined that it's a waste of time. It's not that serious, Willow. Don't make me call Mad Martigan.

OH! Another liberal I get to add to my collection of hypocrites on homosexual issues.

Funny how it's okay for libs to use gay as a pejorative, but you bring up something like gay marriage, and SUDDENLY they get all self righteous and you better not even so much as BREATHE the word gay without complete reverence as one of their vaunted "victims."

Like I said in the other thread. You want to know why they never found a cure for AIDS? Because there are some things even rats won't do!

Now watch the SAME PEOPLE who use gay as a PERJORATIVE, just about explode with outrage over that!

Read the sig. It's only okay to be offensive to conservatives. It's not okay to be offensive to liberals.

Self righteous hypocritical PHONIES!

AND I BET YOU STUPID LIBS THOUGHT YOU THOROUGHLY INTIMIDATED ME INTO NEVER DOING THAT AGAIN! WRONG!!!!!!!!!

So it's gonna be ok for me to make a crack now about the Obama kids and the likelihood of them being fat assed, like their Mom or would that be racist? Just trying to get the boundaries to all this. Cuz I keep hearing, particularly from the left, that we should leave the Obama kids alone.... and yet, y'all seem to have a problem implementing that with Palin's kids. Interesting dichotomy.

If you don't realize that one of those is far more insulting than the other you're an idiot.

If you also don't realize that one of them is meant to be insulting to gays and the other isn't you're an even bigger idiot.

And where exactly did he admit to it meaning homosexual because it sure ain't in this thread?

FoxLies is the propaganda wing of the Republican Party.

NewsCorp, the parent company of FoxLies, donated $1 million dollars to the Republican Governors Association.

Shouldn't it be the other way around?

After all of the slobbering the MSM has been doing over Obama you wanna bring this BS up?

Besides....Republicans aren't in the habit of buying their votes with Treasury funds like the Dems. They aren't bailing out union pensions with billions of dollars of Stimulus funds. They aren't pushing bailout bills to prop up their media suckups. The only thing they ever do is give a tax cut or a tax refund to businesses to help create jobs. And no....a tax-cut doesn't have to be paid for because the dividends you get in return makes it worthwhile.

It's why in communist countries the press only gives THEIR VIEW on everything.

The fact that they can't stop ONE NEWS OUTLET from expressing differing views, just DRIVES THEM INSANE.

What would we do without them? They're the only Media Outlet that doesn't shamefully lick Hopey Changey's boots on a daily basis. Without Fox News we wouldn't get any truth about this White House &amp; Democrats. Anyone with common sense understands that the Liberal dominated MSM can't be trusted. They've been in bed with the Democrats for several decades. Personally i thank God everyday for Fox News and Talk Radio. It's certainly no coincidence this President and Democrats want to shut them down. So keep on Rockin Fox News! The People fully support you!

First of all, I was responding to one of your neg reps. I never initiate contact with you or CG and you know that. Stop being such a damn drama queen. I told you to drop dead. Big deal. Worse things are said on here every single day. As a matter of fact, you told me several months ago to eat shit and die. But I'm sure you don't remember that.

Why are you always getting involved in CG's battles?? Can't she do it alone?? It's very curious. We are not going to do a back and forth here and bore everybody to death. Got it??

Nether one of them is a loser...by any stretch.

But sometimes we say things that we regret and sometimes we say things out of anger. This place is supposed to be a place for exchanging ideas or blowing off steam. However sometimes we can go too far here. I think a line needs to be drawn somewhere. One thing for sure....as long as you're willing to laugh about it afterward there's no hard feelings. No reason to get personal. A thin skin tends to show a lack of self-confidence.

Oh...and I didn't witness the incident but I was told about it so it was made my business.

I have to admit that I'm genuinely surprised that Obama continues to throw stones at FOXNEWS. It's a lose-lose proposition for him. Is it arrogance? ignorance? Has to be one or the other, or perhaps even both.

Here's the bottom line: Obama objects to FOXNEWS because it presents a point of view that is opposite to his. Yet that is the bread-and-butter to any democracy: the freedom to present an opposing view. Now Obama comes across as someone who favors state-controlled propaganda over journalistic integrity.

And I'm not defending FOXNEWS. The principle here is that when any head of state publicly attacks any news organization, that head of state puts himself at a great disadvantage. I thought Obama was supposed to be smarter than that.

You're right, they are not the same. They are better. Their reporting was much fairer. Look at Bernard Goldberg's Great Slobbering Love Affair and the studies he brings showing the Lamestream Media's coverage of Obama was wildly partisan while Fox's was "fair and balanced".

ClosedCaption specializes in strawman arguments.

He can't win on the issues.

<quote>
A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position. To "attack a straw man" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting a superficially similar yet unequivalent proposition (the "straw man"), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position.

ClosedCaption specializes in strawman arguments.

He can't win on the issues.

<quote>
A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position. To "attack a straw man" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting a superficially similar yet unequivalent proposition (the "straw man"), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position.

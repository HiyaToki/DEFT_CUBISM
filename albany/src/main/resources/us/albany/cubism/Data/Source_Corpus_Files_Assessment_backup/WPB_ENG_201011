LONDON - Britain's royal family announced the engagement of Prince William to
Kate Middleton Tuesday, ending years of speculation about whether the second-in-
line to the throne would propose to his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
William, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and son of Diana, Princess of Wales,
will marry Middleton "in the spring or summer of 2011 in London," William's
father, the Prince of Wales, said in an e-mailed statement Tuesday. Both are 28
years old.
</P>
<P>
"Prince William and Miss Middleton became engaged in October during a private
holiday in Kenya," Prince Charles said in the statement issued by his office in
London. "Following the marriage, the couple will live in north Wales, where
Prince William will continue to serve with the Royal Air Force."
</P>
<P>
The wedding announcement puts Middleton in line to become the first commoner to
be queen in modern times. Royal consorts have traditionally come from the ranks
of Britain's aristocracy or from other European royal houses. Middleton, the
daughter of self-made millionaires, met the prince when they were students at
St. Andrews University in Scotland, and they've been dating since 2003.
</P>
<P>
"Kate is a formidable character; she's an intelligent, modern, middle-class girl
who is not easily fazed," Robert Jobson, author of the book "William's
Princess," said in an interview. "She has captured the heart of a prince, which
is a difficult thing to do, and in doing so has shown she is dignified. The
royal family is a difficult thing to come into if you are middle class."
</P>
<P>
Speculation about a royal wedding has grown since the pair rekindled their
relationship after a brief split in April 2007. By July the same year they were
reunited, with Middleton accompanying William at a memorial concert for Diana at
London's Wembley Stadium. In October 2007, she was photographed with William's
father deer-stalking in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
William -- blond, blue-eyed and 6 feet 3 inches tall -- is a flight lieutenant
in the Royal Air Force. With a fortune of $45 million, according to the Sunday
Times Rich List, he was one of the world's most eligible bachelors.
</P>
<P>
Middleton -- baptized Catherine Elizabeth -- is the eldest child of Michael and
Carole Middleton, who own Party Pieces, a website supplying party accessories.
Carole once worked as an airline cabin-crew member. After leaving university,
Kate worked as a junior buyer for the women's fashion chain Jigsaw and later
took photographs for her parents' website.
</P>
<P>
"It's great to have a piece of unadulterated good news that everyone can
celebrate," Cameron told reporters outside his official residence at 10 Downing
Street.
</P>
<P>
Cameron said he spoke to Prince William Tuesday. "He was obviously extremely
excited about the news and thrilled about what lies in store," Cameron said. "I
said the government stood ready to do anything we could to help make sure that
what I know will be a great day of national celebration will be a great
success."
</P>
<P>
Cameron said ministers cheered and banged the table when he told them the news
during this morning's Cabinet meeting. There's been no decision on whether the
wedding day will be a public holiday, the prime minister's spokesman, Steve
Field, told reporters in London.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Ed Miliband, said he was "delighted
for Prince William and Kate Middleton" and that "the whole country will be
wishing them every happiness."
</P>
<P>
Miliband and his partner Justine, who gave birth to their second son on Nov. 7,
are unmarried.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so disappointed" that Prince William is getting married, French Finance
Minister Christine Lagarde joked to reporters in London as she arrived to speak
at the Financial Times's "Women at the Top" conference.

&amp;apos;Hate Group&amp;apos; Designation Angers Same-Sex Marriage Opponents
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
By Krissah Thompson
WASHINGTON POST-BLOOMBERG--11-24-10 1750ET

<P>
The Southern Poverty Law Center this week labeled as "hate groups" several
political and religious organizations that campaign against same-sex marriage
and, the center says, engage in "repeated, groundless name-calling" against gays
and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
Included on the list released by the civil rights organization is the Family
Research Council, a prominent and politically influential group of social
conservatives. The report by the law center, which has spent four decades
tracking extremist groups and hate speech, accuses the council and a dozen other
groups of putting out "demonizing propaganda aimed at homosexuals and other
sexual minorities."
</P>
<P>
The report, which has sparked debate across the Internet, taps into the
continuing potency of social issues, such as same-sex marriage, in American
politics. Several of the groups described in the report supported a successful
effort to oust state Supreme Court judges in Iowa because of a unanimous ruling
last year that legalized same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
The Family Research Council has been at the forefront of political activism
against same-sex marriage. In explaining the decision to put the council on its
hate-groups list, the law center highlighted comments by Peter Sprigg, a senior
fellow for policy studies at the council, who told MSNBC host Chris Matthews
this year that he thinks "homosexual behavior" should be outlawed.
</P>
<P>
Council President Tony Perkins, who was also named in the report, called the
hate-group designation a political attack by a "liberal organization."
</P>
<P>
"The left's smear campaign of conservatives is . . . being driven by the clear
evidence that the American public is losing patience with their radical policy
agenda as seen in the recent election and in the fact that every state . . .
that has had the opportunity to defend the natural definition of marriage has
done so," Perkins said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Earlier this month, voters in Iowa sent a powerful message when they removed
three Supreme Court justices who imposed same-sex marriage on the state. Would
the SPLC also smear the good people of Iowa?"
</P>
<P>
The law center said it chose to highlight the groups on the list "based on their
propagation of known falsehoods" and "repeated, groundless name-calling."
</P>
<P>
"Viewing homosexuality as unbiblical does not qualify organizations for listing
as hate groups," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The debate over the list has focused on whether the law center is right to
equate anti-gay views with racism.
</P>
<P>
Dan Savage, a gay rights advocate and columnist, said in an interview on CNN
that "we need a cultural reckoning around gay and lesbian issues. There was once
two sides to the race debate. There was once a side, you could go on television
and argue for segregation, you could argue against interracial marriage, against
the Civil Rights Act, against extending voting rights to African Americans, and
that used to be treated as one side . . . of a pressing national debate, and it
isn't anymore. And we really need to reach that point with gay and lesbian
issues. There are no 'two sides' to the issues about gay and lesbian rights."
</P>
<P>
Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, objected to
his organization's inclusion in the center's report and said the notion that
groups opposed to same-sex marriage are equivalent to racists is wrong.
</P>
<P>
"This is about protecting marriage. This isn't about being anti-anyone," Brown
said. "The whole idea that somehow those folks who stand up for traditional
marriage, like the Family Research Council, are hateful is wrong. (The law
center is) trying to marginalize and intimidate folks for standing up for
marriage and also trying to equate them somehow to the KKK."

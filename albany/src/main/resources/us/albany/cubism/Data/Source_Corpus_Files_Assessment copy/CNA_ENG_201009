The Yunlin County government issued a NT$1 million (US$31,460) fine to the
Formosa Plastics Group Wednesday after a massive petrochemical complex allegedly
leaked gas that was said to have sickened nearly 100 people.
</P>
<P>
The county's Environmental Protection Bureau also cited the Air Pollution
Control Act in ordering a naphtha cracker in the complex to halt operations.
</P>
<P>
An odor filled the air on Sept. 9 in Yunlin's Mailiao Township and neighboring
Taisi Township,  home to a Formosa  Plastics petrochemical complex that
comprises over 60 factories. Sixty-three students and teachers at five public
elementary schools reported dizziness and nausea, according to the county
government.
</P>
<P>
By the following day, the number of sick had increased to 85, the government
said.
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 13, Taisi Township again reported a strange odor, with 10 elementary
school students and teachers seeking treatment.
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, they all recovered after being taken to hospitals for medical
treatment, " a county official at the Department of Education said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-language China Times cited the bureau as saying its investigation
found the Sept. 13 odor was due to botched procedures at a naphtha storage tank
numbered T8506.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors detected abnormally high concentrations of propane and sulfur dioxide
at the plant, with propane concentrations several times higher  than the
acceptable  level,  and sulfur dioxide concentrations of 311 parts per billion,
above the allowable maximum of 250 ppb, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bureau Director Lai Tung-hung, however, said the final results of a probe into
the cause of the odor and illnesses would not be available for another week.
</P>
<P>
Formosa Plastics said that the tank did not contain either of the chemicals in
question, adding that gas samples from the factory and areas around the tank
also proved normal.
</P>
<P>
The company criticized the county for blaming the petrochemical complex for the
odor without publicizing the results of its probe.
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair to issue an accusation without data," a spokesman for the
enterprise said.
</P>
<P>
In July, two fires broke out at the petrochemical complex, causing a great deal
of damage to local agricultural production and igniting residents' anger over
long-term air pollution that they said was a result of operations in the
complex.

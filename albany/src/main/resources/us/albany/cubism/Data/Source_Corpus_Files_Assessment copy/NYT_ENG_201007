YANKEES PLAN TRIBUTES TO STEINBRENNER AND SHEPPARD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As expected, the Yankees will hold a tribute to George
Steinbrenner before Friday night's game against the Tampa Bay Rays
at Yankee Stadium. The tribute will also honor the longtime Yankees
announcer Bob Sheppard, who died Sunday, just two days before
Steinbrenner died.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Thursday, the Yankees said that the pregame
ceremonies would include a video tribute to Steinbrenner and a
moment of silence honoring both men. The team urged fans to be in
their seats at 6:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
An Army sergeant will sing the national anthem, and there will
also be a West Point color guard.
</P>
<P>
The Yankees said a video tribute for Sheppard would take place
on Saturday, when the Yankees stage their annual Old-Timers' Day in
the Bronx, an event that will be attended by numerous former
Yankees who played for Steinbrenner over the decades.
</P>
<P>
The crowds at both games are likely to give long and loud
salutes to Steinbrenner, the longtime owner. Still, the Yankees are
also planning separate memorial services for him that will be held
at the stadium and at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Fla., the city
where Steinbrenner made his home. The dates for those memorial
services have not been set.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a private funeral for Steinbrenner was expected to be
held Saturday in Florida. Sheppard's funeral was held Thursday on
Long Island.

GEORGE WASHINGTON LAW SCHOOL DEAN TO TAKE HELM AT BRANDEIS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Civil rights scholar Frederick M. Lawrence was named Brandeis
University's
eighth president Thursday, inheriting a school at a crossroad as it
tries
to raise its profile as a world-class institution amid financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, the dean of George Washington University Law School
who once
headed the national legal affairs committee of the Anti-Defamation
League,
will succeed longtime president Jehuda Reinharz in January when he
steps
down after 16 years to lead a Jewish foundation focused on
leadership
education.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old newly named president said he is eager to help
the Waltham
school with Jewish roots and a strong liberal arts focus position
itself
for the future.
</P>
<P>
"This is a compelling opportunity for me to be a part of
furthering and
building a research college, a liberal arts college that is an
anchor for a
great university," Lawrence said in a phone interview. "As a
nonsectarian
school with deep roots in the Jewish community, Brandeis pulls
together
various strands of my life in a way that is unique in higher
education."
</P>
<P>
After Lawrence's appointment was approved Thursday by the Board
of
Trustees, he and his family attended a reception with a small group
of
friends, faculty, and students.
</P>
<P>
It was a homecoming of sorts for Lawrence, who taught law at
Boston
University Law School for 17 years before moving to Washington in
2005.
</P>
<P>
A Williams College graduate, Lawrence had also served five years
as an
assistant US attorney for his native state of New York and headed
the
office's civil rights division under then-US attorney Rudy
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
Faculty, trustees, and a student on the search committee praised
Lawrence's
accomplishments at George Washington, citing his knack for raising
money
and attracting top-notch faculty. Under his leadership, the law
school
posted five of its six most successful years of fund-raising,
bringing in
$13 million in 2007-08, the highest ever, and $11.8 million in
2009-10.
</P>
<P>
Search committee members also commended Lawrence's inclusive
leadership
style, commitment to social justice, and international expansion of
the law
school - qualities they say make him a perfect fit for Brandeis at
this
time.
</P>
<P>
At George Washington, he forged connections with three Indian
universities,
including cofounding a law school in Kharagpur with the India
Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
Brandeis recently increased partnerships and scholarship
exchanges with
Indian institutions in an attempt to boost its international
reputation.
</P>
<P>
Brandeis, which was established in 1948 and is the nation's
youngest major
research university, made great gains during Reinharz's tenure -
admitting
higher-caliber students, tripling the college's endowment, and
establishing
new academic programs.
</P>
<P>
But the school faced major financial pressures after the economy
- and the
university's once $712 million endowment - plummeted and donations
slowed
to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
"Brandeis is in its adolescence in a way; it's got some choices
to make as
it becomes a real grown-up, world-class university," said Jack
Connors
Jr., vice chairman of the trustees. "I think Fred will help guide
the
university to some wise decisions. There's only so much resources
to go
around, and I think he's thoughtful enough not to see them as an ox
to be
gored, but as a cow to be milked."
</P>
<P>
Unlike most colleges, Brandeis relies heavily on donors to fund
a
significant portion of its operating costs. In a bind to raise
money last
year, Reinharz thrust the school into the international spotlight
by
abruptly announcing that it would close its Rose Art Museum and
auction off
the precious works. The college has since put that plan on hold, in
favor
of loaning out the art instead.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence called the move to keep the collection a "better
direction,"
adding that he "remains hopeful we can find an opportunity to
bring
everyone together on this and find a solution." He said he would
like to
strengthen Brandeis's financial footing by broadening its donor
base beyond
the Jewish community and tapping more alumni.
</P>
<P>
In February, the university - which enrolls 3,200 undergraduates
- also
developed a plan to create a balanced operating budget by 2014 that
involved cutting two dozen faculty positions and eliminating a
range of
academic offerings, including the Hebrew undergraduate major. The
difficult
decisions, on top of the museum debacle, divided the campus.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, in his current role, has handled controversy and
criticism with
aplomb, say those who know him.
</P>
<P>
"He is not only a scholar of distinction who knows what it is
like to run
a place, but the most important thing is he knows that everything
that
happens in a university or a law school is also a teaching
moment," said
Guido Calabresi, a US Circuit Court of Appeals judge who, as former
dean of
Yale Law School, taught Lawrence in the late 1970s and remains a
friend and
mentor.
</P>
<P>
In March, when a student ACLU chapter at George Washington Law
used an
obscenity in fliers advertising a visit by an Ohio State law
professor to
discuss his book on word taboos and the protection of First
Amendment
rights, Lawrence did not order the posters removed, to the surprise
of many
faculty and students.
</P>
<P>
The flier was not threatening, he said, and thus should be
protected
expression.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he wrote about the incident in his weekly blog, a form
of
communicating with the university community that he intends to
continue at
Brandeis.
</P>
<P>
"If free expression should flourish anywhere, it is within the
halls of a
university," Lawrence wrote in an entry titled "Putting the 'F'
in free
speech."
</P>
<P>
Other colleagues say Lawrence's personality helps to bridge
differences of
opinion.
</P>
<P>
"He's got a gift for balance. As passionate as he is about
dealing with
issues of hatred, he's also a passionate protector of free
speech," said
Martha Minow, Harvard Law School dean, who was Lawrence's law
school
classmate at Yale. "I think he will bring a kind of broad
cosmopolitan
vision to Brandeis while also reaffirming its distinctive
identity."
</P>
<P>
Reinharz came under fire from some faculty who accused him of
clamping down
on free speech, especially on matters involving Israel to placate
the
school's Jewish donor base.
</P>
<P>
He was criticized, for example, for pulling Brandeis ads from
local public
radio stations to protest NPR's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and shutting down an art exhibit by Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether speakers or artwork critical of Israel should be
allowed on
campus, Lawrence said: "There should always be a full airing of
lots of
different views. People should be allowed to disagree in a reasoned
debate."
</P>
<P>
Andy Hogan, former president of the Brandeis student union, said
the
university's various constituents have felt isolated from key
decisions,
but he has confidence that Lawrence's "mediative style" will
unite the
university community.
</P>
<P>
He and faculty on the committee said a key charge for the new
president is
to translate Brandeis's unique tradition in a way that entices more
high
school students to apply.
</P>
<P>
"This place has absolutely outstanding faculty, superb
students, and
people don't know that as well as they should," said Gregory
Petsko,
biochemistry professor. "If he could do nothing else, it would
make me
enormously happy to raise the public profile of this institution -
locally,
nationally, and internationally."

DIPLOMAT HARSH ON BUSH, BLAIR IN TESTIMONY FOR IRAQ INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the years Hans Blix has spent relating his struggle
to deter the United States and Britain from going to war in Iraq,
he has rarely spoken with the disdain for President George W. Bush
and his top aides -- and their decision to invade Iraq -- that he
displayed on Tuesday before Britain's official inquiry into the
war.
</P>
<P>
Blix, the Swedish diplomat who led the U.N. body that scoured
Iraq for traces of Saddam Hussein's banned weapons program, used
the word "absurd" on several occasions to describe American
arguments for going to war. He also described Britain, the United
States' main ally in the invasion, as "a prisoner on the American
train."
</P>
<P>
Blix concluded three hours of testimony by saying that Iraqis
had suffered worse from the "anarchy" that followed the invasion
in March 2003 than it had under Saddam's dictatorship. Iraq was
already "prostrate" under Saddam, he said, and the impact of
economic sanctions, and the invasion and its aftermath, made things
worse.
</P>
<P>
Blix, 82, is customarily courtly, in the way of the
Cambridge-educated international lawyer he was before he became
Sweden's foreign minister in the late 1970s. But appearing before
the British inquiry as the first non-British witness to speak in a
public session, his quiet, detailed account of the weapons
inspections -- and the decision to go to war before inspections were
completed -- was punctuated by acerbic observations about the
American role.
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly referred to the U.S. president as "Bush,"
without using his title or an honorific, while referring to Tony
Blair, the British prime minister who joined the invasion, as "Mr.
Blair." He criticized both leaders, as he has before, for resting
their case for going to war on intelligence about Iraq's weapons
programs that he described as poor.
</P>
<P>
"I have never questioned the good faith of Mr. Blair, or Mr.
Bush," he said at one point. "What I questioned was the good
judgment, particularly of Bush, but also about Mr. Blair to some
extent."
</P>
<P>
After the invasion, American-led weapons inspection teams found
no stockpiles of banned weapons or traces of continuing programs to
produce them.
</P>
<P>
As for Saddam, Blix said he attributed Iraq's failure to comply
fully with U.N. inspection teams in the years before the invasion
to a refusal by Saddam to undergo what he viewed as "humiliation"
at the hands of the West.
</P>
<P>
"I see him like Nebuchadnezzar, the emperor of Mesopotamia -- an
utterly ruthless, brutal man who sat with a revolver in his pocket
and could use it to shoot you," and who thought he could outwit
the West "and misjudged things at the end," Blix said.
</P>
<P>
After eight months of hearings, the inquiry is nearing the end
of the hearings. It is expected to issue a report by the end of
2010.

TOM TANCREDO RUN A GOP GAME-CHANGER IN COLO. GOVERNOR ' S RACE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with two politically-damaged gubernatorial candidates and
the emergence of Tom Tancredo as a third-party contender who will
likely split the GOP vote, dejected Colorado Republicans Monday
tried to come up with a realistic strategy to take back the
governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
But political observers -- and even GOP chair Dick Wadhams -- were
already predicting that former Congressman Tancredo's entry into
the race sounded the death knell for the party's gubernatorial bid
and may cause problems for state legislative races.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult if not impossible to beat (Democrat) John
Hickenlooper with Tancredo in the race," said Wadhams, noting that
Tancredo will siphon just enough votes away from the GOP nominee to
give Hickenlooper a win.
</P>
<P>
Added political analyst Eric Sondermann: "There is a danger
that Tancredo is going to say outrageous things and other
Republicans will be called on to react to them. This complicates
the Republican agenda."
</P>
<P>
Tancredo, a former Colorado congressman, is perhaps most
well-known for his staunch opposition to illegal immigration. Most
recently, he has called for the impeachment of President Barack
Obama. Three years ago, he said the U.S. should "bomb Mecca."
</P>
<P>
Last week, he issued an ultimatum to Republican gubernatorial
candidates Scott McInnis, who is embroiled in a plagiarism scandal,
and Dan Maes, who owes $17,500 for violating campaign finance laws:
promise by Monday to get out of the race if polls show the Aug. 10
primary winner lagging behind Hickenlooper or else he would get in
as the American Constitution Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
Both McInnis and Maes rejected his ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
"Coming from a man whose career has been marked by
often-astonishing levels of arrogance, this move shouldn't surprise
us," Maes said. "And yet, one would suppose that even someone of
Tancredo's conceit would bow to the greater good in a year such as
this."
</P>
<P>
McInnis didn't address Tancredo specifically, but issued a
statement saying: "Those looking for a deadline should focus on
the only real deadline: August 10 at 7 p.m. This is when the polls
close, the people have voted and their votes are counted."
</P>
<P>
Tancredo said he intends to officially become the constitution
party candidate as soon as a number of legal requirements are
fulfilled. And he isn't bothered by those who call him a spoiler.
</P>
<P>
"Most of my political life, a lot of people have disliked what
I do," he said in an interview with The Denver Post, which first
reported Monday his intention to launch a third-party bid. "The
(Republican) party is already a mess."
</P>
<P>
Wadhams said that Tancredo's third-party candidacy had nothing
to do with Republicans and everything to do with Tacredo's
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
"He is a maniacal egotist whose only goal is to get media
attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
This year was the Republicans' best shot at winning the
governor's race in eight years, and a number of independent
political groups and the Republican Governor's Association had
already invested time and money in the race.
</P>
<P>
But there are 37 governor contests this year, and about 25 are
competitive, said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes the country's
gubernatorial races as a senior editor at the non-partisan Cook
Political Report.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of mouths to feed," she said. "At some
point, the RGA is going to make a decision about who they can
realistically help or whether they are throwing money at a lost
cause."
</P>
<P>
The RGA did not return an email for comment.
</P>
<P>
Money from their group, as well as independent committees, help
not only the top candidates, but the ones down the ticket --
especially with get-out-the vote efforts. If funding dries up,
legislative candidates may face additional hurdles.
</P>
<P>
"With Tom Tancredo in the race, it makes it extremely
challenging for Republicans to have a successful November," said
Sean Tonner, who is involved with at least one group trying to
raise and spend millions of dollars to elect state Republicans.
Last week, the Post reported that McInnis' plagiarism scandal
negatively impacted Tonner's fundraising, making it difficult to
pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
Tancredo plans to leave McInnis and Maes alone and "solely
target Hickenlooper," said Tancredo spokeswoman Jennifer Raiffie.
Tancredo has criticized Hickenlooper in the past, notably when an
illegal immigrant who was a dishwasher at a restaurant owned in
part by Hickenlooper killed one Denver police officer and wounded
another. The employee had been stopped three previous times for
routine traffic incidents but Denver police and the courts let him
go when he produced a valid Mexican driver's license.
</P>
<P>
Tancredo can likely inflict political damage upon Hickenlooper,
but political observers don't believe it will be long-lasting,
especially since Tancredo is viewed as too far right by many
unaffiliateds and moderates.
</P>
<P>
"I think Tancredo can make Hickenlooper's life less pleasant,
but I would say what Colorado cares about is jobs and the
economy," said Katy Atkinson, a GOP consultant. "In the past when
Republicans have tried to make illegal immigration a singular wedge
issue, it hasn't worked."
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 presidential election, Colorado backed Democrat Bill
Clinton: independent candidate Ross Perot took 23 percent of the
vote, while President George H. Bush got 36 percent and Clinton
received 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
"A few weeks ago, every poll showed Republicans up an average
of five points because the election has become a referendum on
Obama," said Denver pollster Floyd Ciruli. "But there is no
possibility of a win in a three-way race with two Republicans."

WALK ON EGGSHELLS, GET EGG ON YOUR FACE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
AUSTIN, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until last week, Shirley Sherrod was an obscure
U.S. Department of Agriculture official.
</P>
<P>
She is obscure no more because of a maliciously edited video
that twisted, distorted and maimed beyond recognition a story she
was telling about racial reconciliation. She was fired on the
strength of that now discredited video. An embarrassed Tom Vilsack,
the secretary of agriculture, offered her another job, and the
president himself called to try to make things right.
</P>
<P>
You probably know all that and no doubt have formed an opinion
on it. Sherrod has become an icon or maybe a cautionary tale or a
sore point in the country's ongoing struggle in confronting its
racial issues.
</P>
<P>
We've shown no talent or depth for the discussion because we've
yet to be honest about it. Racial discussions often tend to veer
off into parties airing their grievances, real or perceived.
</P>
<P>
The doctored video stoked the notion that African-Americans in
positions of power are waiting to pounce vengefully on innocent and
undeserving whites.
</P>
<P>
In the video, Sherrod is shown telling an approving audience at
a gathering of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People about a white farmer who sought her assistance. "I
was struggling with the fact that so many black people have lost
their farmland, and here I was faced with having to help a white
person save their land -- so I didn't give him the full force of
what I could do. I did enough," Sherrod said.
</P>
<P>
Cut.
</P>
<P>
Here's what was left out: 1) The incident happened long before
Sherrod took a job with the federal government, and 2) she helped
that farmer avoid bankruptcy. He kept his farm and was so grateful
that his was one of the first voices to ask for her reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
Sherrod's full remarks told of how she overcame those feelings
and committed to help the white farmer save his land.
</P>
<P>
It was a good story aimed at an audience of African-American
youths who might have benefited from the wisdom of Sherrod's
remarks but for the furor. What they ultimately learned is that
speaking candidly about racial matters will hurt you.
</P>
<P>
Once the doctored video hit Fox News, everybody jumped. Thumping
their chests over the Agriculture Department's zero-tolerance
policy on discrimination, agency officials extracted Sherrod's
resignation. Even the NAACP condemned her -- all the on the basis
of out-of-context, incomplete remarks that played right into the
darkest racial insecurities.
</P>
<P>
Now, of course, there is major rescrambling. Vilsack and the
administration are scrambling to wipe the egg off their collective
face. Fox News personality Bill O'Reilly apologized -- sort of --
for airing the piece. Andrew Breitbart, who supplied the clip, is
peddling a line that he was essentially right.
</P>
<P>
No, he wasn't. And neither were Vilsack, the White House, the
NAACP, O'Reilly or Fox News. They all sound like the fellow who
wakes up with a horrible hangover and pledges "Never again" --
until happy hour rolls around. They smeared a good woman's name.
And why? Because she told the truth.
</P>
<P>
We could learn from this, but the country's history on
confronting and exorcising its racist demons doesn't inspire much
confidence.
</P>
<P>
This episode speaks volumes about how government and the media
are such suckers for cries of reverse discrimination that they rush
to the sound of pop guns.
</P>
<P>
But it speaks even louder to how far our society -- one that has
come a long way from its segregationist past -- has yet to go
before we deal with each other as people and not stereotypical
products of our racial insecurities.

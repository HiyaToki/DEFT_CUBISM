HOWARD ZINN: AN APPRECIATION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had the good fortune to interview Howard Zinn in 1999, and
what will stay with me most is his exuberance, his humility and his
easy smile. And man, was this not the most beautiful head of hair
any historian ever had? (No offense, David McCullough.)
</P>
<P>
Zinn, who died Wednesday at 87 while on a visit to Santa Monica,
Calif., met up with me in a Harvard Square coffee shop (yes, a safe
lefty haven if ever there were one) to discuss Fox's improbable
plans to adapt "A People's History of the United States." The
1980 book might have become a favorite alternative textbook in many
classrooms (it turns out Christopher Columbus wasn't such a
sweetheart, after all), but it wasn't exactly material one would
associate with corporate mogul Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
Zinn was amused by the whole thing. But he also wondered if Fox
were to pick up "A People's History," maybe that meant that his
book was no longer all that radical. (He needn't have worried; the
ambitious project fell through, although the History Channel did
recently air the documentary "The People Speak," inspired by the
book.)
</P>
<P>
Like a beaming grandfather, Zinn seemed most proud of Matt
Damon, who grew up near the Boston University professor in Newton,
Mass., and who, with his pal Ben Affleck, was co-producing the TV
dramatization. "He's paying me back for the cookies we used to
give him when he came around the house," Zinn joked.
</P>
<P>
Zinn's youthful ebullience also came through in talking about a
recent Pearl Jam concert the World War II bomber pilot had attended
in Los Angeles. The band's leader, Eddie Vedder, was a friend, but
to hear Zinn tell it, it didn't sound like name-dropping.
</P>
<P>
"It was a wild, crazy experience, believe me," he said,
holding up his hands, his eyes lighting up. He also liked the music
-- "which surprised the hell out of me," he added.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was a fan of Zinn's views. Arthur M. Schlesinger
Jr., the old Kennedy hand who taught history a few blocks away, at
Harvard, said of Zinn: "He's a polemicist, not a historian."
</P>
<P>
Agree with him or not, however, it was hard not to be won over
by Zinn's charm: He was a radical who made his case passionately,
but without rancor. And there was that radiant, inviting smile. Few
could be counted on to challenge the status quo like Zinn, and few
carried it off with such grace and goodwill.

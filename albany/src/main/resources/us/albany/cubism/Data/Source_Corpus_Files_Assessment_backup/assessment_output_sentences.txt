This is probably just an annoying response to your OP, but any chance you'd give a description of the link to let us know if it's something we're interested in clicking on?

I risked the click based on the URL, and yes, it's the famous Grace Hopper lecture (one of 'em) explaining why she likes 11.8 inches.

Here, I've typed up a transcript for those who don't want to watch the video...
They started talking about circuits that acted in nanoseconds, billionths of a second. Oh, I didn't know what a billion was, I don't think most of those men downtown knew what a billion is either, and, ah, if you don't know what a billion is, how on earth do you know what a billionth is?

I fussed and fumed. Finally one morning, in total desperation, I called over to the engineering building, and said " please cut off a nanosecond and send it over to me ", and I brought you some today.

Now what I wanted when I asked for a nanosecond was, I wanted a piece of wire to represent the maximum distance that electricity could travel in a billionth of a second.

Of course, it wouldn't really be through wire. It'd be out in space, velocity of light, so if you start with the velocity of light and use your friendly computer, you'll discover that a nanosecond is 11.8 inches long. The maximum limiting distance that electricity could travel in a billionth of a second.

Again in about a week I called back and said " I need something to compare this to. Could I please have a microsecond? "

I've only got one microsecond, so I can't give you each one. Here's a microsecond. Nine hundred and eighty-four feet. I sometimes think we ought to hang one over every programmer's desk, or around their neck, so they know what they're throwing away when they throw away a microsecond.

Now I hope you all get your nanoseconds. They're absolutely marvelous for explaining to wives and husbands and children, admirals, generals, people like that. An admiral wanted to know why it took so damn long to send a message via satellite, and I had to point out that between here and the satellite were a very large number of nanoseconds.

You see, you can explain these things, it's really very helpful, so be sure to get your nanoseconds.

This is not remotely intended to be nasty, so I apologize in advance if it comes across that way to you: the people (like me) who wuld be interested in this do not require other information- we are interested in scientific phenomena and their measurements AND we know who Grace is (was) so all necessary to let us know to go was there. It is highly unlikely someone not in one or both of those categories would be interested, though not impossible. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

(For those who don't know it, Grace Murray Hopper (1906-1992) was a programmer on the Mark I computer at Harvard during WWII, an officer in the US Naval Reserve, eventually retiring for the third time involuntarily with the rank of Rear Admiral at age 79, awarded the DDSM, signing on with Digital Equipment Corporation immediately afterwards, a doctor who turned down a full professorship at Vassar to continue working for the Navy, the creator of the first computer programming language COBOL, and the inventor of the term "debugging" by pulling a moth from between the contacts of a relay and pasting it in her lab book. She was known before her death as Amazing Grace.)

But someone who didn't already know what a nanosecond was is unlikely to understand negative exponents either.

Perhaps you should have used...

1 nanosecond = 0. 000 000 001 seconds.

Now the nanosecond is explained.

My wife had (and it may still be in the attic) one of those Grace Hopper nanosecond's.

Actually, it is highly likely that someone could be in the "interested in scientific phenomena" category (like me) and not in the "know who Grace is/was" category (also me) and hence, the further information would be (was, in fact) helpful. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

Among her other accomplishments, Grace Hopper gave us:

It's easier to apologize later than it is to get permission.

That is perhaps the most important practical advice I have ever received.

Her first compiler was for the A-x systems, long before COBOL. And it wasn't a compiler as we know them today; that honor goes to the Fortran guys.

It's one thing to know what it is that way, and another to know how that relates to the dimensions and events of real life, and I think Hopper did a nice job of that.

Explaining the nanosecond to someone who doesn't already know what a nanosecond is, and isn't in a 10th grade science class specifically to learn about it :-

"It's a very, very short period of time. Much shorter than you will ever care to think about, and incredibly shorter than you will ever need to measure."

Then I guess we'll just have to try something she hasn't beaten us to. She never did explain exactly what a second was, did she?

1 second = 1 000 000 000 nanoseconds.

There, I win. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

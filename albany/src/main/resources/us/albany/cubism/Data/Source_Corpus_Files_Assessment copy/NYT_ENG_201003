INDIA AND RUSSIA SIGN DEVELOPMENT PACTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
India and Russia signed a series of agreements on
nuclear, space and military issues on Friday, after a visit by
Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Putin's visit, and the warm reception he received here from his
Indian counterpart, Manmohan Singh, represent a warming
relationship between nations with a long history of friendship that
has been challenged by India's increasingly cozy ties to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The agreements pave the way to build at least a dozen more
Russian nuclear power plants for an energy-starved India, and to
funnel more Russian weapons to India's military.
</P>
<P>
The countries also reached agreements to work together on space
and fertilizer projects, two crucial areas for India, which has
sought to send rockets into space even as its farmers, who make up
about 70 percent of the population, struggle to coax subsistence
from the soil.
</P>
<P>
As a pioneer of the Non-Aligned Movement, India was officially
neutral in the Cold War, but in practical terms it had a much
closer relationship with the Soviet Union than it did with the
United States, a country it viewed warily for ideological and
geopolitical reasons.
</P>
<P>
In a post-Cold-War world, India and Russia remain important
allies. India buys the vast majority of its weapons from Russia,
and has invested in Russian oil and gas in an effort to guarantee
supplies to keep its rapidly growing economy going. The countries
also make up half of the BRIC Group of rapidly growing economies,
along with Brazil and China.
</P>
<P>
Putin met with top political and business leaders, speaking to a
group of industrialists in Mumbai, Bangalore and New Delhi via
videoconference.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation in high-tech is the priority for us," Putin told
his audience. "The Russian government is ready to directly support
this activity, with the help of additional financial assistance."

MCCAIN TAPS INTO BROWN ' S STAR POWER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHOENIX - US Senator Scott Brown, driving past neat rows of palm
trees and
haciendas, brought his political star power to Arizona yesterday to
join
his senior colleague Senator John McCain at a campaign rally that
featured
strongly worded denunciations of the Democrats' proposed health
care plan.
</P>
<P>
If the sight of a freshman senator from Massachusetts arriving
to burnish
the conservative credentials of the GOP's 2008 presidential nominee
was
somewhat jarring, so too were the swarms of Phoenix residents
seeking
Brown's autograph in a crush after the rally.
</P>
<P>
"I'm honored to be in Antelope country!" Brown told a crowd of
about
1,000 in the gymnasium of Grand Canyon University, a
nondenominational
Christian school whose sports teams are known affectionately as the
'Lopes.
</P>
<P>
"Wow. This is great," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If you told me five months ago that I'd be standing here in
front of you,
I would say, 'You're full of it."'
</P>
<P>
McCain is locked in one of his toughest reelection fights of his
career,
and is hoping Brown's two-day swing here can bolster his image with
irate
Tea Party activists and other conservatives. McCain's chief
opponent in the
Republican primary, former congressman and talk radio personality
J.D.
Hayworth, pulled close to McCain in a poll last fall after
criticizing
McCain as too liberal, although a January poll showed McCain with a
strong
lead.
</P>
<P>
There was nothing liberal about the message McCain and Brown
dished up for
the crowd, as the pair hammered the administration for the nation's
continued high unemployment rate and railed against President
Obama's
health care plan.
</P>
<P>
They also warned that Democrats are hatching plans to ram health
care
through the Senate using a process known as budget reconciliation,
which
allows for a simple majority vote in the Senate, and would get
around a
Republican filibuster.
</P>
<P>
"Scott and I just returned from trying to do the Lord's work in
the city
of Satan," McCain said. He called the health care plan "unsavory,
Chicago-style sausage making," and said, "We're going to fight,
and
fight, and fight."
</P>
<P>
Brown accused the Democrats of engaging in "political chicanery
and
parliamentary maneuvers."
</P>
<P>
Afterward, a crush of people approached the freshman
Massachusetts senator,
taking photos with cellphones and asking him to autograph McCain
campaign
stickers. One man presented him with a baseball, and Brown took out
a
marker and signed his signature along with .41, a reference to his
election, which gave the GOP 41 votes in the Senate, and stripped
Democrats
of their 60-vote supermajority.
</P>
<P>
Many in the crowd were star-struck by the politician they had
read about
and watched on TV, and who was making his first campaign appearance
outside
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
"I made sure my schedule was free," said Pete Leonard, a
34-year-old from
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
"Having seen ((the election)) and followed it, I wanted to see
this guy
and see what the hype is about. I just want to be part of the
action."
</P>
<P>
"Bless you!" a woman yelled to him.
</P>
<P>
"Save us, senator," another said to him, quietly. "Save us."
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know until I showed up that Scott Brown was going to
be here,"
said Mark Doebele, a 33-year-old high school teacher from Phoenix.
"I was
like: 'Holy cow. Scott Brown's here?' Don't tell Senator McCain
this, but
that was almost more exciting."
</P>
<P>
McCain was the first US senator to meet with Brown when he was
considered a
long-shot candidate running for the seat left vacant by the death
of Edward
M. Kennedy. Brown has since called McCain his political role model.
</P>
<P>
"He brings star power. Kinda like Sarah Palin does, you know?"
McCain
said in an interview. "He's a national figure. People react to him
in the
most positive way ... He comes in a position of significant
influence, in
our party and in the Senate."
</P>
<P>
The campaign swing to Arizona could also test Brown's
fund-raising ability,
although McCain and his aides would not say how much of a haul was
expected
at events at the home of a former McCain aide last night in Phoenix
and a
similar gathering today in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
With the rise of Tea Party activists, the Republican Party is
being divided
by some of the same antiestablishment populism that is afflicting
majority
Democrats in Congress. Brown has been able to bridge that GOP
divide thus
far, appealing to both independent-minded moderates and far-right
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's been really impressed with Scott Brown," said
former Arizona
attorney general (and McCain chief of staff) Grant Woods, who
hosted last
night's fund-raiser. "He could do great things for the Republican
Party.
More importantly, I think he represents the potential that maybe
things
could actually get done in Washington."
</P>
<P>
Brown is trying to perform a delicate dance. He was applauded by
Republicans for helping block a labor board nominee shortly after
his
swearing-in last month, but several weeks later some supporters
called him
"Benedict Brown" after he broke with most of the GOP Senate
caucus and
provided a key vote in favor of a $15 billion jobs bill that was
pushed by
Senate majority leader Harry Reid. This week, he offered an
amendment to
that bill that would cut payroll taxes, an idea that appeals to the
Republican base.
</P>
<P>
Brown told the Grand Canyon University crowd that during his
election
campaign he discovered that "people were hurting, they're angry.
They've
had enough."
</P>
<P>
McCain highlighted "out-of-control spending," and said
Congress was
"spending money like a drunken sailor, and the bar is still
open."
</P>
<P>
The pair flew to Arizona together yesterday morning from
Washington. He and
McCain are also planning to go to Tucson today, where they will
attend a
University of Arizona basketball game.
</P>
<P>
Brown's trip, however, will cause him to miss several basketball
games of
greater rooting interest to him. His daughter, Ayla, who plays for
Boston
College, is participating in the Atlantic Coast Conference
tournament in
Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
"When I scheduled it, I scheduled it obviously not knowing when
the ACC
tournament was," Brown said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to be there, but I get the tweets and the texts, and
everyone
keeps me informed. Spoke to her this morning, gave her a pep talk
... She
understands that I have a new role."

CARDINALS GET THEIR MAN IN PENNY, WHOSE RECORD HAS BEEN SPOTTY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JUPITER, Fla.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manager Tony La Russa coveted Brad Penny for
years.
</P>
<P>
And the right-hander felt the same way about the St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
"I grew up a Cardinals fan," Penny said. "I always told my
agent if I get a chance to play in St. Louis I'd love to."
</P>
<P>
Penny, an Oklahoma native, returned to the backfields of Roger
Dean Stadium this spring for the first time since being traded from
the Marlins in 2004. He signed with his favorite boyhood team for
$7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Penny, 31, is hoping the one-year contract will put him in
position for one more big payday.
</P>
<P>
St. Louis is his fourth team in just more than a year. After
starting 33 games, winning 16 and being named an All-Star in both
2006 and '07 with the L.A. Dodgers, a shoulder injury limited him
to 17 starts in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Penny signed a one-year, $5 million deal with Boston in January
2009, was released in August, and pitched the last month in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
"When a guy pitches against us and I'm really concerned that
he's going to shut us down, then I'd like to have him," La Russa
said. "Going back to when he was with the Marlins, I always
thought -- I hope we don't get this guy this series. That meant I
wish he was on our team."
</P>
<P>
Penny believes his struggles in Boston last season -- 5.61 ERA
and .299 batting average against in 24 starts -- had more to do
with the dimensions of Fenway Park than his stuff, saying foul
balls in smaller parks "aren't outs, they are extra pitches."
</P>
<P>
Yet his 5.45 ERA at Fenway was lower than his 5.79 ERA on the
road with the Red Sox and lower than his 5.91 ERA in two road
starts with the Giants. Penny had a 1.45 ERA in four starts in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Penny, who has relied on his fastball but has developed an
assortment of pitches, joined Boston after feeling slighted his
final season with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Yahoo! Sports last year, Penny said he was
upset that management questioned his injury and said third base
coach Larry Bowa talked behind his back.
</P>
<P>
Bowa reacted angrily.
</P>
<P>
"Is this the same Penny that never went to meetings, that came
late, left early, was never in shape, always had an excuse when
things didn't go right, didn't help the young kids at all?" Bowa
told The Los Angeles Times when told of Penny's comments.
</P>
<P>
The two spoke and cleared the air later in the season and the
Cardinals have said Penny enters their organization with a clean
slate.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good time in his career because he's right in
his prime and he's healthy and he's got some experience," La Russa
said.
</P>
<P>
Pitching coach Dave Duncan said Penny is "in shape (and) where
he should be at this point in the spring."
</P>
<P>
Penny will make his first start as a Cardinal on Friday at Roger
Dean Stadium against the New York Mets. He will concentrate on
locating his off-speed pitches.
</P>
<P>
"I had a year off of not throwing with my stuff," he said of
2008. "You come back and you have to control it again and it took
a little bit.
</P>
<P>
"I just have to get my innings and my work in, locate my
off-speed. For me, that's when I'm most successful."

HATRED AS A POLITICAL STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEWT GINGRICH had a nerve. No, wait. He hit nerves no one wants to
talk
about.
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week with the Washington Post, the former
speaker of
the House who led the charge to slash social programs during the
Clinton
presidency, said President Obama and the Democrats would regret
pushing to
pass the health care bill. Gingrich called the bill "the most
radical
social experiment ... in modern times," so radical that Obama and
the
Democrats "will have destroyed their party much as Lyndon Johnson
shattered the Democratic Party for 40 years."
</P>
<P>
The Post said the quote referred to civil rights bills enacted
under
Johnson. Gingrich said that was not what he meant. In a correction,
the
Post wrote, "Gingrich said he was referring not to the civil
rights
legislation but to Johnson overreaching on his management of the
economy,
the Vietnam War and the cultural divisions that emerged partly
because of
that war. Gingrich said Johnson erred on civil rights by supporting
busing
to integrate schools and by failing to take a firmer stance against
racial
violence in urban areas."
</P>
<P>
By clarifying, Gingrich helps us get why health care became the
most
divisive social-program debate since Gingrich's successful attack
on
welfare in the 1990s, an attack that had racial overtones. Health
care is
breaking the backs of millions of families of all colors, but the
Republicans chose to gin up the masses with unbridled fear, with
House
Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio declaring the vote
"Armageddon."
</P>
<P>
It was Armageddon all right, a battle between selfishness and
sharing.
Some Americans who believe health care reform represents a heist of
"their" resources for the undeserving betrayed their underlying
feelings
as Democratic congressmen were either called the N word or spat
upon, a
Latino congressman was called a "wetback," and Massachusetts
Representative Barney Frank, who is gay, was called the F word.
</P>
<P>
No Republican had the courage to remind the rabid that America,
at other
great crossroads, did put government into their lives. The wealth
of
countless white middle class families today stems from World War II
veteran
housing bills that too often, we conveniently forget, discriminated
against
black veterans along with housing segregation. Surely, more than
one tea
partier has Medicare or uses a VA hospital. Yet most Republicans do
anything they can to deflect responsibility for the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
None is more representative than Gingrich who, after saying
there was of
course no place for such behavior, told the Journal-Constitution,
"I think
the Democratic leadership has to take some real responsibility (for
choosing) to use corrupt tactics that bought votes, that bullied
people and
as a result has enraged much of the American people."
</P>
<P>
Some things just add up. The vast majority of tea partiers, at
least from
all the photos, are white and the nearly all-white Republican
congressional
delegation stood as a brick wall against reform. The rage around
health
care, going back to the disruptions of Democratic legislator town
halls
last summer, continues to raise the temperature not just on health
care,
but on the dangerous debate on who is a "true blue" American.
</P>
<P>
One cannot forget how, in a last gasp before Obama's election,
Republican
vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said of Obama, "I am just
so
fearful that this is not a man who sees America as you and I do."
One
cannot forget the level of disrespect shown to Obama in the "You
lie!"
outburst by South Carolina Republican Representative Joe Wilson.
Wilson has
been rewarded for his outburst with the most campaign contributions
of
anyone in the House, $3.4 million in the 2010 election cycle.
</P>
<P>
In the final stages of the health care debate, Palin and other
Republican
leaders resorted to telling their masses to "reload" or get ready
for the
"firing line" in November. Republican Congressman Randy
Neugebauer had to
apologize for shouting "baby killer" when anti-abortion Democrat
Bart
Stupak of Michigan gave his support for the health care bill. The
Republicans need to find someone with courage to disarm the
rhetoric,
before someone reloads for real.

TEXAS HOUSE MEMBER SAYS HE WAS THE ONE WHO SHOUTED ' BABY KILLER '  IN DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texas Republican Rep. Randy Neugebauer has 'fessed
up.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-term congressman admits that he interrupted Rep. Bart
Stupak, D-Mich., during heated debate over health care reform
Sunday night by shouting out an "inappropriate" comment about
killing babies.
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer's House colleagues said they heard a lawmaker shout
"baby killer" when Stupak -- leader of anti-abortion House members
-- was speaking against a Republican attempt to scuttle health-care
reform.
</P>
<P>
But Neugebauer, 60, said Monday that he had declared, "It's a
baby killer" -- referring to the Democrats' health-reform bill --
rather than describing Stupak as a "baby killer."
</P>
<P>
"Last night was the climax of weeks and months of debate on a
health care bill that my constituents fear and do not support,"
Neugebauer said in a statement. "In the heat and emotion of the
debate, I exclaimed the phrase 'it's a baby killer' in reference to
the agreement reached by the Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
"While I remain heartbroken over the passage of this bill and
the tragic consequences it will have for the unborn, I deeply
regret that my actions were mistakenly interpreted as a direct
reference to Congressman Stupak himself."
</P>
<P>
Stupak had angered Republicans by switching his position on the
Democratic health proposal after President Obama signed an
executive order declaring that the new law would not affect current
restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortions.
</P>
<P>
The unruly outburst was reminiscent of South Carolina Rep. Joe
Wilson's "you lie" comment shouted at President Obama during a
2009 health-care speech to Congress.
</P>
<P>
In the Sunday incident, Neugebauer quickly became a suspect when
colleagues said the heckler spoke with a Southern accent, while
Rep. John Campbell, R-Calif., declared that the utterance came from
a row "where the Texans sit."
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer did not confirm that he was the culprit until the
afternoon after the incident.
</P>
<P>
"I have apologized to Mr. Stupak and also apologize to my
colleagues for the manner in which I expressed my disappointment
about the bill," Neugebauer said Monday. "The House Chamber is a
place of decorum and respect. The timing and tone of my comment
last night was inappropriate."
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer was elected to Congress in 2003 after Texas
Republicans enacted an unusual mid-decade redistricting plan that
transformed veteran Democratic Rep. Charlie Stenholm's district
into a Republican bastion. One of the most conservative members of
the House, Neugebauer made news last year as a co-sponsor of a
House resolution seeking to require presidential candidates to
provide a copy of their authentic birth certificate.

U.S. DENIES PATENT EXTENSION FOR BLOOD DRUG
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reprieve from a billion-dollar blunder proved all too brief
for Medicines Co.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Friday again denied the
company's request to extend the life of the patent protecting its
main drug, the blood thinner Angiomax.
</P>
<P>
Medicines has been trying since 2001 to undo an error, when it
narrowly missed a 60-day window for requesting the patent
extension. Because the patent office would not accept the late
application, the patent has been scheduled to expire next Tuesday,
rather than in late 2014. That will cost the company hundreds of
millions of dollars or more in lost sales from earlier generic
competition.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, a federal judge ordered the patent office
to reconsider its rejection of the extension, suggesting the agency
had been too strict in interpreting the law's language regarding
the 60-day deadline. The judge, Claude M. Hilton of U.S. District
Court in Alexandria, Va., also told the patent office to keep the
patent in force while it conducted its reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
By Friday, however, the patent office had already concluded its
review, telling the company that it would stick with its previous
decisions and would not accept the company's application.
</P>
<P>
The decision, and especially how rapidly it was made, stunned
and infuriated the company.
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm at war; this is very disconcerting," Clive A.
Meanwell, the company's chief executive, said late Friday. Meanwell
said he thought the patent office would have taken more time and
would have talked to the company. "It's not even polite, you know
what I mean?" he said.
</P>
<P>
The patent office could not immediately be reached for comment
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwell said the company was considering its options, including
going to court again. The company, based in Parsippany, N.J., has
also been lobbying to have Congress enact legislation that would
allow the patent office to accept slightly late applications.
</P>
<P>
Angiomax had about $400 million in sales last year, of which
$383 million were in the United States. Sales of the drug account
for virtually all the company's revenue. Medicines Company shares
dropped 15 percent on Friday, to $7.88.
</P>
<P>
The patent office did honor Hilton's order to grant an interim
patent extension while it deliberated. So the patent will expire at
the end of the day on May 23, instead of next Tuesday, March 23.
</P>
<P>
The patent office on Thursday described this as a 60-day
extension. It is actually 61 days -- sort of the same mistake the
company made nine years ago. The patent office corrected its
mistake the next day.

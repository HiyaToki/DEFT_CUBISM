<P>
South Africa's national soccer coach Pitso Mosimane praised players Itumeleng
Khune and Teko Modise Tuesday for their performances against Sierra Leone over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Goalkeeper Khune made some crucial stops, while playmaker Modise, who was a late
replacement for the injured Steven Pienaar, also impressed Mosimane in the 0-0
draw in Freetown, according to Sport24 in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I do not like to single out players, but Khune made two brilliant saves that
kept us on the game while the much criticized Modise was superb for the full 90
minutes," Mosimane said.
</P>
<P>
The coach said  he always had faith in Modise. "Sierra Leone were dangerous on
the left and Modise's experience was brilliant in snuffing out the danger from
that area of their midfield."
</P>
<P>
Mosimane said Modise again showed he is a top quality player.
</P>
<P>
"I knew he would not let me down. If he can come through this tough 90 minutes
in Freetown then the PSL (South African Premier Soccer League) will be a piece
of cake for him. I am happy to see his confidence is back," added Mosimane.
</P>
<P>
Although Modise has twice been South Africa's PSL Footballer of the Year, he has
struggled for form since last year's FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa.

New book from Italian government official says convicted murderer
Knox is innocent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Eric J. Lyman
</P>
<P>
ROME, Oct. 19 (Xinhua) -- A key member of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's
government says he believes that Amanda Knox -- the 23-year-old American woman
found guilty in the grizzly 2007 murder of her British roommate Meredith Kercher
at the foreign university in Perugia -- is innocent.
</P>
<P>
In a book published on Tuesday and scheduled to hit bookstore shelves later this
week, the official said he interviewed Knox 20 times in prison and no longer has
any doubts about her innocence.
</P>
<P>
Knox is currently serving a 26-year prison term in the wake of a year-long trial
that concluded in December 2009. The trial brought international attention to
the sleepy Umbrian city of Perugia, because of the sexual and violent nature of
the murder and because of charges that the wide-ranging trial might have been
unfair.
</P>
<P>
Knox and her former boyfriend and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito have both
vowed to appeal the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
But Rocco Girlanda, a 44-year-old member of parliament from Berlusconi's People
of Freedom alliance, says he does not need to wait for the appeal to know that
Knox is innocent.
</P>
<P>
The book, written in Italian and entitled "Take Me With You -- Talks With Amanda
Knox In Prison," does not examine the evidence of the judicial case against
Knox, but rather focuses on her character, examining her childhood, her
religious faith, and her plans for the future. It concludes that Knox was not
capable of such a bloody crime.
</P>
<P>
"I found she was a very different girl from what I imagined and was afraid of,"
Girlanda said at a press briefing. "I thought I would meet a girl described as
sex, drugs, and rock and roll. But from our conversations a very different
person emerged."
</P>
<P>
Political leaders from the United States and other countries have spoken on
Knox's behalf, but until the publication of Girlanda's book, no high-ranking
Italian official has commented on the case.
</P>
<P>
In the book, Girlanda said he believes he has "a beautiful friendship" with
Knox, which he believes will continue even if Knox remains in prison and beyond
her eventual release.
</P>
<P>
Francesco Maresca, the lawyer for Kercher's family, blasted Girlanda's book as
"irresponsible" and "poorly thought out."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Maresca said the parliamentarian failed to take into
consideration the feelings of the victim's family, made no effort to look into
the merits of the bitter court battle, and put too much importance on his
personal relationship with Knox.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear Girlanda thinks Knox is innocent," Maresca said. " But it is
reckless for him to publish a book on the topic because he has not seen the
court files and he did not attend the trial."
</P>
<P>
Maresca noted that regardless of the nature of Girlanda's conversations with
Knox, they came three years after the murder.
</P>
<P>
"Three years in prison can change a person," he said. "People can appear
different, and maybe they can really change. But that is all after the fact and
it has no reflection on guilt or innocence."
</P>
<P>
Knox's appeal will get underway on Nov. 24. Her lawyers hope the earlier
judgment could be thrown out, or her sentence significantly reduced, as was the
case with another co-defendant, Rudy Hermann Guede, who had his sentence reduced
from 30 years to 16 in 2009.
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors have said they believed Knox is "cold-blooded" and
"manipulative," and they continue to insist on her guilt. They have said they
will seek a longer sentence for Knox.
</P>
<P>
From the United States, Knox's father, Curt Knox, said he hopes Girlanda's book
will help change his daughter's image in Italy, where he said she has been
vilified.

China's science ministry lambasts scientist in assault scandal,
denies payroll claim
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BEIJING, Oct. 13 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's Ministry of Science and Technology has lambasted a doctor at the center
of an academic fraud scandal who masterminded two violent attacks on his
critics, and denied he was still on the payroll of a medical research project.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued a statement on its website late Tuesday, claiming Doctor
Xiao Chuanguo had no respect for the law and disrupted social order.
</P>
<P>
It said Xiao should be condemned for his vicious misconduct and lack of
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Xiao, 55, head of the Urology Department of Wuhan Union Hospital, was sentenced
Sunday to five and a half months in detention by the Shijingshan District
People's Court of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The court found Xiao hired four men to attack two writers who had accused him of
academic fraud.
</P>
<P>
Xiao believed the accusation had led to his failing to become a member of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The victims of the violent attacks were Fang Zhouzi, a science writer with a
reputation for exposing academic fraud, and Fang Xuanchang, an editor at the
economic journal, Caijing.
</P>
<P>
The ministry denied claims that Xiao was still a chief scientist on a ministry-
sponsored science project.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Xiao used to be the chief scientist researching
neurological damage repair on the "973 Plan," a key national science project.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Xiao's program ran from 2003 to 2008 and that Xiao was no
longer responsible for any "973 plan" projects.
</P>
<P>
It said "chief scientist" was not an honorary title.

Hayward says leaving top post out of 'love' for BP
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, July 30, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outgoing BP CEO Tony Hayward would have liked to remain in his job, but is
leaving after a firestorm over his handling of the US oil spill because of his
"love" for the British firm.
</P>
<P>
In his first interview since resigning his post Tuesday, Hayward, 53, told the
Wall Street Journal that he was unfairly vilified for his handling of the
environmental catastrophe, the worst in US history.
</P>
<P>
"I became a villain for doing the right thing," Hayward told the Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
"But I understand that people find it easier to vilify an individual more than a
company."
</P>
<P>
Speaking about his planned October 1 departure from the helm of the company,
Hayward said he was leaving reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to leave BP, because I love the company," Hayward said, adding
that "because I love the company, I must leave BP."
</P>
<P>
"BP can rebuild faster in America without Tony Hayward as its CEO," he said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as the troubled oil giant worked to permanently cap the Gulf of
Mexico oil well, which was temporarily plugged this month after weeks during
which it spewed millions of gallons of crude into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
Hayward handed over day-to-day management of the crisis in June to Bob Dudley,
who has been named to succeed him in October and who will be the company's first
non-British chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Hayward was skewered over his gaffe-filled handling of the disaster, especially
after saying that he wanted his "life back" and downplaying the environmental
impact of the spill.
</P>
<P>
But he defended his actions in the Journal interview, telling the paper that he
did everything possible once the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank in
the Gulf, including taking responsibility for the spill and spending billions of
dollars to try to stop the flow of oil and clean up the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
Hayward will remain a BP board member until November 30 and has been nominated
as a non-executive director of Russian joint venture TNK-BP.
</P>
<P>
The Journal reported that Hayward was greeted with a standing ovation on
Wednesday as he held the first in a series of employee town halls at corporate
headquarters,
</P>
<P>
"If you keep clapping, I will cry," he said, with his voice cracking. "Having me
as BP's public face has become untenable," he said, adding that moving away from
the top post "a very tough decision."
</P>
<P>
At the same event, the daily wrote, BP's incoming chief executive Dudley praised
his Hayward, telling BP employees that "it's a measure of the man that Tony is
willing to step down, just when things are starting to go right."

US hit by new oil spill: officials
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CHIGAGO, July 29, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new oil spill is sullying US waters in the northern state of Michigan after a
pipeline leak sent more than a million gallons of crude into a river tributary,
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said the spill began Monday when a
30-inch (76-centimeter) pipe in Marshall, Michigan burst, spewing the crude into
Talmadge Creek, a waterway which feeds into the Kalamazoo River.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the pipeline belongs to the Canadian company Enbridge Inc.
</P>
<P>
The agency said it is directing and monitoring all aspects of oil spill clean-up
and containment efforts over 30 miles (48 kilometers) of the Kalamazoo River,
including marshlands, residential areas, farmland, and businesses.
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious spill that has the potential to damage a vital waterway and
threatens public health," said EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson.
</P>
<P>
"Staff from EPA's regional and headquarters office are on the scene and ensuring
the leaked oil is contained and cleaned up as quickly and effectively as
possible."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the environmental agency requested that the US Coast Guard make two
million dollars available for the federal response to the spill, and said the
money eventually will be reimbursed by Enbridge.
</P>
<P>
Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm however criticized both EPA and Enbridge
Wednesday for what she described as a slow response so far.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very, very serious," Granholm said in a conference call with
the news media, adding that oil could reach Lake Michigan if more intensive
containment measures are not put in place.
</P>
<P>
The Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge said in a statement that it views the
incident "very seriously."
</P>
<P>
"We're treating this situation as a top priority," the company statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to thoroughly cleaning up the site as quickly as possible. The
safety of people and the protection of the environment are our highest
priorities during the clean-up."
</P>
<P>
Enbridge said that the faulty pipeline has been shut down and isolation valves
closed, stopping the flow of oil.
</P>
<P>
An investigation is underway into the cause of the leak, it added.

N.Ireland's Paisley slams pope visit to Britain
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
london, July 2, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Northern Ireland leader Ian Paisley condemned Friday an invitation for
the pope to visit Britain later this year, while slamming child-abusing Catholic
priests as "anti-Christ".
</P>
<P>
The firebrand former Protestant preacher said the decision to invite Pope
Benedict XVI to Britain in September was a "mistake."
</P>
<P>
"I think he should not be invited to the country," the 84-year-old hardliner
told the BBC World Service, adding: "I don't know how it has been done because
they have had it all secret.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows who made the thing. You go and ask a question of any minister and
he says he doesn't want to have anything to do with it. The Queen is only
meeting them on Scottish soil, not on English soil."
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a mistake," he said.
</P>
<P>
The September 16-19 papal visit to Britain is the first by a pope since 1982,
when a six-day tour by John Paul II's drew huge crowds. He was the first pontiff
to make the trip for 450 years.
</P>
<P>
Benedict XVI will be received at the start of his tour by Queen Elizabeth II,
the head of the Church of England, in Edinburgh, before travelling to Glasgow
and London.
</P>
<P>
Paisley, who was Northern Ireland's first minister from 2007 to 2008, also
lambasted the Vatican's response to child sex abuse scandals which have rocked
the Catholic church in a number of countries, including Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a terrible happening in Ireland with the priests and monks and nuns
all taking part in acts of disgraceful behaviour with young people and we
haven't seen the Catholic Church taking a strong stand on this," he said.
</P>
<P>
And he added: "A person, like some of the priests we've had, destroying the
lives of young people and then going out and saying I can forgive sins, it's
only right that be called what it is.
</P>
<P>
"That is anti-Christ in teaching and in doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Paisley announced in March that he would not stand in May British general
elections, winding down a career as a key figure in the long-troubled province's
road to peace.
</P>
<P>
Paisley helped bring stability to Northern Ireland, dogged by three decades of
civil unrest known as "the Troubles" until the 1990s, by finally agreeing to
share power in the province with one-time arch-enemies Sinn Fein.

Germany slams jailing of Syrian rights lawyer

BERLIN, July 7, 2010 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Germany condemned Wednesday the jailing of a 79-year-old prominent human rights
lawyer by a Syrian court and demanded his immediate release.
</P>
<P>
The German government's human rights commissioner, Markus Loening, said he was
"shocked" by the sentencing of Haytham al-Maleh to three years in prison Sunday
on charges of "publishing false information".
</P>
<P>
"Mr Maleh is considered a leader of the Syrian human rights movement who has
committed himself for decades at great personal risk for the protection of human
rights in his country," Loening said.
</P>
<P>
"I call on the Syrian government to comply with its international commitments,
in particular in implementing the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights and, in light of Mr Maleh's advanced age and his precarious health,
release him immediately."
</P>
<P>
Maleh was arrested in Damascus on October 14 last year, and investigated by the
military court over articles he had written.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer had been imprisoned from 1980 to 1986, along with a large number of
trade unionists, activists and political opponents, for demanding constitutional
reforms.
</P>
<P>
He has worked with Amnesty International since 1989 and, in 2001, helped to
establish the Syrian Human Rights Association, whose activities have been frozen
for more than three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Wednesday called on Muslims to
fight the "blind and savage terrorism" fuelled by US and Britain, whom he blamed
for deadly bombings of an Iranian mosque.
</P>
<P>
"In our region... the blind and savage terrorism is born out of the evil
policies of the United States, Britain and their state and non-state
mercenaries," Khamenei said in a statement marking the seventh day of mourning
for victims of the bombings of a Shiite mosque in southeastern Iran.
</P>
<P>
"All Muslims are required to combat and confront this evil and sinister
offspring which is the epitome of corruption on earth and of waging war against
God," the all-powerful Khamenei said in the statement read out on state
television.
</P>
<P>
Two suicide bombers on Thursday blew themselves up at a Shiite mosque in
Zahedan, the capital of Sistan-Baluchestan province which borders Afghanistan
and Pakistan, killing 28 people and wounding hundreds.

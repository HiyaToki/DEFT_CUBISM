BACK HOME, A MOROCCAN RAPPER SHARPENS HIS WORDS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CASABLANCA, Morocco
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is treated like a prince in Hay
al-Mohammadi, the district of slums, markets, immigrants and
working-class Moroccans out of which he began to scramble as a
teenager, 15 years old, singing with one of the first rap groups in
Morocco, CasaMuslim.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad Bahri, now 29, is proud of the district, which was
central to popular resistance to French colonial rule, and the
people here are proud of him, a kid who made it out, an old urban
story. People slap him on the back, buy him coffee, ask him about
his parents and his recent marriage, and talk about their problems
-- poverty, the police, drugs in the neighborhood, their kids.
</P>
<P>
But it has not been such an easy ride for Bahri, who goes by the
stage name of Barry, printed on his yellow T-shirt. His political
songs, criticizing a feared former interior minister and the
police, have gotten him into trouble, and his performances at some
music festivals have been disrupted.
</P>
<P>
In one famous song, called "Driss," he took on Driss Basri,
who ran the Interior Ministry from 1979 to 1999, known here as
"the years of lead." Basri was considered King Hassan II's tough
right hand, his iron fist, keeping order through wide-scale
detentions, repression and prison torture.
</P>
<P>
"Driss was a farmer and became a policeman," Bahri sings. "We
told him to keep an eye on the stick and then he beat us with it.
Enough, enough, enough from that stick." Later, he sings: "They
gave him the keys to the safe, and he locked it in front of us."
</P>
<P>
"People were quite shocked by this," he said during a recent
interview, laughing, pushing his Ray-Bans up onto his forehead.
"But with each album I try to do a song that shocks the people."
</P>
<P>
Basri was dismissed by the current king, Muhammad VI, within
months of his accession to the throne in 1999, after the death of
his father. The former minister exiled himself to Paris, where he
died in 2007, at 69. He was buried in Rabat, but the only member of
the government to attend the funeral was the current interior
minister, Chakib Benmoussa.
</P>
<P>
Near Hay al-Mohammadi, in Derb Moulay Sherif, there is an
infamous underground prison, originally built by the French, where
conditions for political prisoners were said to be unspeakable
under Basri. The new king earned much respect from ordinary
Moroccans when he made a personal visit to the prison without
warning; it was later closed.
</P>
<P>
Bahri's grandfather, a poet, spent time in the prison, arrested
for opposition to French rule, Bahri said.
</P>
<P>
A song like "Driss" would have been impossible under the reign
of King Hassan, Bahri said. King Muhammad has loosened restrictions
considerably on the news media and popular culture, but within
limits that include criticism of the king and the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
Under King Hassan, Bahri said, it was difficult to say anything,
so musicians created a style, a kind of Moroccan popular music
called "chaabi," similar to Algerian "ra?," which plays with
traditional folk melodies. But now there are more modern blends and
stronger content.
</P>
<P>
"Here it is possible now to bark, but gently," Bahri said.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, when Islamic radicals set off a series of bombs in
Casablanca, killing 45, wounding hundreds and shocking Morocco,
Bahri was playing at a club 200 yards from one of the bombings.
</P>
<P>
The room was shaking, and we kept playing," he said. "We
thought it was an earthquake." He soon understood differently and
went into the street.
</P>
<P>
"I saw everything destroyed," he said, still astonished in the
retelling. "There were a lot of arrests, and a lot of people put
into jail who had nothing to do with anything, but we had a problem
of Qaida cells here."
</P>
<P>
His first response was to write a song aimed at al-Qaida called
"Who Are You?"
</P>
<P>
"Who are you?" he asks. "Who are you today?"
</P>
<P>
"You made terrorism, it was a present for Bush," he sings,
referring to former President George W. Bush. "Do you want peace,
or do you want the politics of the CIA?"
</P>
<P>
The song continues: "You start to wear big trousers, and you
grow your beard, and you wear tagia," a knitted cap. "You speak
of resistance but you are tamed monsters. If you understood the
Quran, there wouldn't be bombs."
</P>
<P>
But Bahri also wrote a song attacking the international politics
of Bush, called "Johnny Walker Bush, li man habbouch," or "the
one we dislike."
</P>
<P>
"The blood of every Arab is not enough for me," he sings.
"How greedy! We sent him to hell."
</P>
<P>
Bahri left the neighborhood five years ago, but he tries to keep
in touch with his parents and friends there, partly in search of
material that will make his songs resonate. "I always get my ideas
from these poor districts, I read the newspapers and follow the
news," he said. "I have the feeling I can influence things
through my songs."
</P>
<P>
Many of Morocco's poor are illiterate, and Bahri believes that
his songs can educate and inspire. "I see myself as an ambassador
or a journalist, and I try to reach people who don't read
newspapers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bahri's father was an excellent soccer player who made the
national team. Later, he became an engineer on the national train
network. He never made much money, but pushed Bahri to get an
education.
</P>
<P>
In Hay al-Mohammadi, where Bahri's parents, brother and sister
still live, there are signs of rebuilding and development. "Before
M6," as King Muhammad VI is known, "they forgot this district,"
Bahri said. But beyond the market and the nearby hovels for the
poor, there are some new and renovated schools, including a new
sports center and playground. There are some programs to send
children to seaside camps in the summer.
</P>
<P>
But poverty and illiteracy remain high here. "These people were
all in crisis before the crisis arrived," Bahri said. "If you
don't work here, you don't eat. If you stay at home, you die."
</P>
<P>
Muhammad Mardi, 66, a retired teacher, greeted Bahri and
congratulated him on his marriage. Mardi was supervising three
young men cementing broken tiles in front of a shop, to create a
more decorative walkway.
</P>
<P>
One of the men, Khaled al-Omari, 24, said he had little work and
lived with his mother, who sells vegetables at the market, and four
siblings. "When I can, I clean fish at the market," he said. "I
don't even earn 50 dirhams a day," about $6.25.
</P>
<P>
There is anger, too. In the market, near the fly-strewn stalls
for butchered meat, a bearded vendor said in Arabic to Bahri,
referring to the American journalist: "You take care of him. If
not, we'll slaughter him." It was not said in a lighthearted
fashion.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is also in the head," Bahri said, then began
laughing. "We all need psychiatrists."

CASTING DIRECTOR TWEETS AT TRYOUTS, TO NEGATIVE REVIEWS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Twitter becomes increasingly popular, this online
social network has infiltrated nearly all the cracks and crevices
of the arts world. But does it belong in an audition room?
</P>
<P>
That question isn't academic for several New York actors and a
casting director. A series of messages was posted on Wednesday on
the Twitter feed of Daryl Eisenberg, a casting director whose
company, Daryl Eisenberg Casting, has handled shows including the
musical "Altar Boyz" and the television series "Gossip Girl."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, while Eisenberg was conducting a casting session
for "Gay Bride of Frankenstein," which will begin performances in
late September as part of the New York Musical Theater Festival,
she was also tweeting about the performers who were auditioning for
her.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning actors by name, Eisenberg commented on
performances with messages like, "If we wanted to hear it a
different way, don't worry, we'll ask," or "If you are going to
sing about getting on your knees, might as well do it and crawl
towards us ... right?"
</P>
<P>
In later messages on Eisenberg's feed (which now has more than
1,800 followers), she also fired a pre-emptive strike at any
potential critics, writing: "There is NO rule/guideline against
Twitter/Facebook/MySpace/Friendster. Freedom of speech. Ever heard
of it?"
</P>
<P>
Within hours, actors were debating the appropriateness of
Eisenberg's tweets on message boards at theater Web sites.
</P>
<P>
As one commenter who uses the screen name CapnHook wrote on
BroadwayWorld.com: "I don't care that she twittered anonymous
audition feedback. As long as she didn't name names, I think it is
perfectly fine. It's even interesting to read. Some of her tweets
provided legit tips to actors." The commenter added: "I think it
is rude to be on your phone and/or on your laptop in the audition
room."
</P>
<P>
Another BroadwayWorld.com commenter called SporkGoddess wrote
that Eisenberg's tweets "aren't necessarily helpful hints,"
adding, "It's all her opinions and caprices."
</P>
<P>
In a post on Thursday BroadwayWorld.com reported that Eisenberg
had written similar messages at earlier auditions. For example, at
a casting session on July 22, she tweeted: "Seeing No. 70 right
now. I'm tired. My ears are bleeding," and "Holding your foot
above your head IN YOUR HEADSHOT is a BAD IDEA!"
</P>
<P>
Actors' Equity Association, the union that represents actors and
stage managers, was displeased with Eisenberg's actions.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Maria Somma, a spokeswoman for Actors' Equity,
said: "It's a very long road for an actor to get from seeing the
casting notice to getting that audition. To have it mocked is
unfair to the actors and to the other people who are working on the
particular project. It's very simply that there is an expected
level of respect and professionalism, and these values were
violated."
</P>
<P>
In an e-mail message on Friday morning Eisenberg offered
apologies to "those hurt by this" and wrote that she would be
"definitely considering the appropriateness and professionalism of
the timing and tone of my communication in the future."
</P>
<P>
She added that she would be meeting with Actors' Equity on
Friday "so that we can discuss Twitter's place in this industry
and how I can help put this behind us amicably."
</P>
<P>
In an interview Gary Zuckerbrod, the president of the Casting
Society of America, said Eisenberg's actions were wrong. Actors, he
said, "are exposing themselves in the audition process."
</P>
<P>
"They are emoting in a way that is not normal in any other kind
of interview," he continued. "What happens in an audition room
"should not be publicized, especially in a derogatory manner."
</P>
<P>
Zuckerbrod said the society would not take any formal action
against Ms. Eisenberg. "We're hoping that Actors' Equity solves
this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eisenberg met with representatives from Actors' Equity on Friday
afternoon, after which she and the organization each released a
statement. Eisenberg's said she was "happy to report that we have
agreed to both put this behind us."
</P>
<P>
She said there would be no more tweets "coming from the
audition room regarding the actors auditioning" and she offered an
apology to the actors "who put themselves on the line every time
they audition." She concluded with "I hope to see you all in the
audition room soon."
</P>
<P>
For its part, Actors' Equity said it "firmly believes that
Twitter is a valuable promotional tool for producers to reach a
wide potential audience, but that tweeting has absolutely no place
in the audition room, which is a safe haven for actors who are
seeking employment in this competitive market."
</P>
<P>
The statement added, "We believe this incident is now closed."
</P>
<P>
Billy Butler, the producer, composer and co-writer of "Gay
Bride of Frankenstein," said in an interview that he had scheduled
a new round of auditions for the show on Monday, and would allow
actors who attended the earlier Wednesday audition to attend this
session. Eisenberg, he said, would also be present.
</P>
<P>
"She is under contract," Butler said, "and though I don't
condone what she did, she is doing her job for me. We just have
some great talent that she's found."
</P>
<P>
Butler, a member of Actors' Equity, said that the newness of
social networks like Twitter means that users may not be aware of
the potential consequences of using them.
</P>
<P>
"It's a fine line with this whole Twittering thing," he said.
"It's a whole new world, and nobody expected this. I didn't expect
certain things to be said and done, and honestly, when it comes
down to it, I have a show to cast."
</P>
<P>
And at the next casting session, he added, things will be done a
little differently.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be running the audition," Butler said. "All cell
phones, and computers and digital watches will be left in our
bags."

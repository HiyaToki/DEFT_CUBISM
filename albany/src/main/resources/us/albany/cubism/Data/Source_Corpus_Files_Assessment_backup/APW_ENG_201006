<P>
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says his country and Syria both view the United States and Israel as enemies.
</P>
<P>
Chavez made the remark Sunday as Syrian President Bashar Assad concluded a visit to Venezuela. Chavez said "we have common enemies," describing them as "the Yankee empire, the genocidal state of Israel."
</P>
<P>
Assad praised Chavez for standing up to the U.S. and supporting the Palestinians. The Syrian leader condemned Israel's blockade of Gaza and said Syria wants peace in the Mideast but not "submission" on Israel's terms.
</P>
<P>
Assad also sardonically suggested Venezuela and Syria might form an "axis of evil" made up of "good governments." Former President George W. Bush once used that term for enemies such as Iran and Syria.

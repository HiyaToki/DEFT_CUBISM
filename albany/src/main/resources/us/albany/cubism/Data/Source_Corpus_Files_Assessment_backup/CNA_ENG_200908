President Ma Ying-jeou paid his respects Thursday to a deceased village
administrator who slipped to his death during a daring effort to save his
village in Yunlin County on a night when Typhoon Morakot was raging.
</P>
<P>
Ma visited the home of Miu Jung-tang, head of the Chinghan Village Office in
Yunlin County's Kouhu township, and offered his condolences to Miu's family.
</P>
<P>
Miu, 47, is survived by his wife, their four children and his 80-year-old father
who has been confined to a sick bed for years.
</P>
<P>
Miu braved strong winds and heavy rains on the night of Aug. 9 to climb onto a
drainage channel near the coastal area of Chinghan Village to close the water
gate and thus prevent the village from being inundated by waves kicked up by the
typhoon.
</P>
<P>
However, immediately after closing the water gate, he slipped and fell into the
channel where he drowned.
</P>
<P>
Praising Miu's efforts as heroic, Ma said Miu showed great courage in the face
of danger and was a national role model.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he will see to it that Miu's family receives good condolence
compensation from the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Yunlin County government in southern Taiwan presented a special
certificate of commendation for bravery to Miu's family Wednesday and renamed
the water gate as the Jung Tang Water Gate in commemoration of the late
administrator.

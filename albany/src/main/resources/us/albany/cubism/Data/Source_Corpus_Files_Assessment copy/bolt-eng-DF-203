I was just wondering who everyone roots for so I know who to hate when the playoffs are in full swing. <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-5.gif" alt="Wink"/> Some are obvious (BruinsBabe), but I know there are several of us.
I am a blue towel waving, Sid the Kid loving, Penguins fan.

I'm from Toronto with the inevitable legacy of being a fair weather Leafs fan. If (or shall I say, when) they don't make the playoffs, the Montreal Canadiens are my go-to team of choice. So basically this year I'm officially screwed. Other than the Leafs and Habs, I don't much care who wins as long as it's not the Ottawa Senators (bunch of uppity upstarts), and there is actual ice/snow in the city with the team that wins the Stanley cup (so Boston yes, Florida no). And yes I have been the hockey hall of fame and everyone should go, it's pretty awesome.

Amen to the bolded part! That is my biggest pet peeve. I always say that in order to have a hockey team, you should be able to play one game of hockey outside a year, at least.

Well, admitting you have a problem is the first step to recovery...
I'd give you my usual line of "come to the dark side, we have cookies," but we all know you're already on the dark side. So, I guess to you I say "Come to the bright side, we have cookies." Btw, your husband is a very wise man. You should listen to him.

Where should H and I go for vacation in late this month?
</headline>
<post author="mathgal102..." datetime="2012-02-02T07:26:00" id="p1">
We have the President's Day holiday and we don't work that Friday before so I can take my measly couple of days vacation I've earned since Key West in November and take about a week off. No other holidays til late May so I'm hoping to make the most of it. We have a $200 Southwest Credit we have to use too. I was thinking Panama City or actually driving to Charleston (9 hours but by the time we would drive to the airport, wait and fly it would be about the same and we love roadtrips) and do the SC low country.
We like nature stuff and we like the beach but not just a "lay on the beach" vacation. We like a good happy hour but not a "whole just drink vacay" like Vegas would be. Any other ideas or recs for Panama City or Charleston?
</post>
<post author="mathgal102..." datetime="2012-02-02T07:27:00" id="p2">
Oh and we would use BWI-Baltimore airport or the Philadelphia airport.

What about Savannah?
My family always went to Jekyll Island in Georgia (DH and I try to go every few years now). Its got beaches, and parks, and a sea turtle hospital. Its about an hour from Florida, 45 mins to Savannah...its one of my favorite places.

Or Disney!

What about the mountains somewhere? I might be partial b/c I live in NC but Asheville is beautiful and so far we have had a mild winter.
I also second the Disney suggestion. You could go to Universal and go to Harry Potter world. I haven't read the books and I still want to go there.

Don't do Disney that week. It will be a ZOO because of school vacation. You'll have a hard time enjoying it with how busy it will be.
What about Vegas and you could go to the Grand Canyon or Zion National Park? Even if you don't gamble there's great food and shows. You could do a few days there and a few days at one of the national parks. I've flown SWA into Vegas before, so I know they go there.

A girl I work with recently went to Savannah and said it was such a great city - beautiful, historic, but with lots of cool things to do (haunted mansions, bars, etc.) It's on our list of places to visit soon.

FI &amp; I get a 3-4 day vacation in Europe. Suggestions?
</headline>
<post author="lissadelso..." datetime="2012-03-17T20:23:00" id="p1">
So FI and I are getting married at the end of August in the US. Unfortunately, we can't do a honeymoon because we both have to come right back to the UK to submit and defend dissertations the first two weeks of September. Our next round of programs (moving to PhD from master's) begin the last week of September. That gives us 1 week break, and we've decided we're going to go somewhere in Europe as a mini-moon.
Which brings me to my question: any suggestions for somewhere that's nice in September and would be doable in 3 or 4 days (from London)? We were considering Paris potentially, but I'd like to go somewhere new.

Not sure what your interests are, but if it were me, b/w the xAtlantic travel, wedding, schoolwork, and general busy-ness of living in a large city (I'm assuming you live in London), to max my time off and min my logistics stress, I'd: 1) check sky scanner.net for DIRECT flights and 2) go somewhere in either the countryside or the beach.
San Sebastian, SP
Tuscany (fly into Pisa or Florence), IT (Lucca or Chianti, for the respective airports)

September is grape harvest/wine making time!

We just got back from a little town called Laguardia in the Basque Country, Spain.
It's just 16 km. outside of Logroño and two hours south of Bilbao. I loved our visit, it was a nice, romantic, relaxing weekend. The wine was good, and the pinchos (tapas/small portions of food) were excellent. Compared to the coast, it was cheap! You could fly into Vitoria, Logroño, or Bilbao. If you're interested, I can let you know more about the region and/or wineries there.

There are a million options! DH and I tend to book holidays based on price so we look for where we can get to cheaply whatever week we want to travel and plan from there. September is a great month to travel pretty much anywhere!
I am obsessed with Italy and love city breaks so I would probably pick an Italian city if you haven't been - I've been to Rome, Florence and Venice and love them all. Lisbon is fantastic too! On my list right now is Berlin and Barcelona - Barcelona would be nice if you're looking for a beach + city option.

Ireland. I've been living here for nearly two years and it is amazing.
If you are in Cork you'll be near Bunratty Castle which is awesome for kids (adults too). And you are not too far from all the sights in County Kerry which is the best part of Ireland. There is TONS to do

How old are the boys? If I'm right that they're pretty young, I think they'd probably love the castle, and I'd save Morocco for when they're older and can appreciate it more.

I think as a blonde my experience there was a little different. I drew A LOT of attention - both good and bad - but it made my time there a little weird. Even H noticed how different it was when he went out without me. I don't really know how to explain it, but people were watching me all.the.time and had already formed opinions on me before I spoke to them. It was really disconcerting and some things were said to me that made me really uncomfortable.

Speaking of vacations: KC MMers
</headline>
<post author="Brie2010" datetime="2012-03-27T11:58:00" id="p1">
DH and I want to do a short weekend getaway before the baby gets here. We don't want to take too much time off work because I'm hoarding it for my mat leave. Unfortunately, I'm kind of drawing a blank as far as desirable vacation spots within driving distance of here.

We'd prefer to drive somewhere because we like road trips and they're obviously more MM. I'm thinking anything &lt;6 hours is fair game. I have a shitton of Marriott points to use, too. We are not into hiking/camping/outdoorsy stuff, and our ideal vacation would involve lots of good food, museums, and time to relax somewhere poolside.

We did Omaha for our anniversary last year, and have been to St. Louis a million times as well (though not necessarily for touristy stuff).

Any suggestions?

It's about 4 hours from KC. Has lots of cute shops and art galleries and festivals from time to time. They also have a really cool wildlife reserve called Turpentine Creek with some big cats (tigers, lions, etc.) and bears that have been rescued from auctions/abusive situations.

Branson is cheesy, don't get me wrong, but there's also some normal-ish things to do.
They have The Landing, which is a new shopping/dining development on the lake, and some outlets if you like to shop. Branson also has a cool, old-timey downtown and Silver Dollar City is pretty neat.
If you end up going for the cheesinest, send me a PM or e-mail. I can hook you up :)

Branson sucks. I much prefer the Lake if you're wanting that sort of vacation.

I was actually going to suggest Denver - there is a lot more culture there than you'd think (don't mean that to sound bad - personally I always just associated it with skiing until DH took a trip there in the summer and came back raving about the restaurants and walkability).

What about Chicago? You could take the train if you didn't want to deal with having a car in the city.

DH grew up not far from the Lake, so he is not into that idea. I'll be in Chicago twice this summer to see family, so that's not really a vacation trip for us since I'm from there and we go all the time.

I am really liking the Denver idea though.

<post author="midwest07" datetime="2012-03-27T13:07:00" id="p11">
I was going to suggest Big Cedar Lodge (which is, yes, near Branson) until you said no outdoorsy stuff. You may still like it though, you should check it out online. Others already mentioned Denver and CHicago, which are potentially driveable. If you did the train to Chicago, I would actually drive to St Louis and then catch the train. Other driveable locations would be Des Moines (much cooler than you think, maybe someone from there can chime in), Boulder (a little further than Denver), Minneapolis, and Dallas. I haven't been to Eureka Springs, but know a lot of people who really like it there. Not sure if any of these really fit your desire for being poolside, I guess if you go early summer that would work.

<post author="cjeanette" datetime="2012-03-27T13:54:00" id="p12">
Big Cedar is a popular one.
You could stay near town and do The Elms in Excelsior or Chateau Avalon in KCK (I stayed there on my wedding night)
My parents honeymooned in Eureka Springs and loved it.

<post author="KristysRed..." datetime="2012-03-27T13:55:00" id="p13">
If you wanted to go a little further I'd recommend Shreveport. I spent some time there this past week and really liked it and am looking forward to going back that way in Dec.
Another suggestion would be OKC. Go through Hutchinson, KS and go to the Cosmosphere, it's awesome, go through Wichita, check out their museums, then go down to OKC.

Best west coast or west US destination?
</headline>
<post author="nmmsest06" datetime="2012-04-18T21:22:00" id="p1">
DH found out about a contest they're having where he works and three lucky people will win all-expense-paid trips to anywhere in the US. So we're daydreaming where we'd go if he was one of the lucky three. We can agree that we'd like to go to the western part of the country since we're on the east coast. He doesn't want to go anywhere he's been, which rules out California, although I'd love to see Cali since I've never been. (If he does end up winning, I will really push for Cali!) He says Vegas, but there are other places I'd rather see first.
So, humor me and tell me your favorite Western US destination! We are enjoying the daydreaming! <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile"/>

Seattle was another place I suggested, as I almost went there for my externship in Culinary School (didnt' because I met DH about two months before I was supposed to go!!).

This summer we are going back out to Seattle to visit my sister. We are all going out to the Olympic Peninsula for a few days, too, which is also supposed to be pretty. You could do Mt. Ranier, etc. My family has also done a trip out to the San Juan Islands (outside of Seattle) but unfortunately I was not able to go to that one.

I have to say DH is lucky IMO to get to travel some for work (usually 1-2 times a year). Its funny though that they'll tell him "hey you're going to Texas!" He thinks, "wow cool!" Then he finds out where he is actually going in Texas is some rinky dink tiny town with one Cajun restaurant and a bunch of tumbleweeds! When they told him about California he got all excited. He got to his hotel near Victorville and was hugely dissapointed. But I guess you gotta go where the clients are.

No,no, no. I love Claremont. The Village got me through undergrad. I was just wondering where the hell people could've been coming from for that rally. It was so out of the ordinary.
Op, I had a great time is Portland, Seattle, and SF. San Diego may also be a nice option.

I've only ever lived in WA State. When I was growing up we vacationed in Bandon, OR for 4-5 years in a row. It's on the coast right on the border of CA and OR. Tiny little beach town. I loved it and want to go back and take my H who has only ever driven through Oregon (and gone to a wedding) there.

REALLY??? he ruled out CA??
We live on the east coast, too and one of the best trips we ever took was a 10 day road trip down the CA Coast. (and that says a lot bc we've been all over the US and Europe!)
we flew into San Fran and spent 3 nights there (toured alcatraz, walked around the city, took a day trip to Napa Valley, hiked around the Marin Headlands)
We hiked in some of the Redwood Forests, drove along the PCH for some great scenery. checked out pebble beach golf course, walked on Hollywood Boulevard in LA, Huntington Beach, toured the Hearst Castle, Santa Barbara is a really cool town... and we ended up with 3 nights in San Diego ( did the zoo, hiked in Torrey Pines, hung out on the beautiful beaches, had some great authentic mexican food in Old Town :-)
I would buy some travel guides for that area ( there is one that is specifically for the CA coast road trip) and talk him into it :-)

You definitely can't rule out CA because of Victorville. I live in the low desert (going toward Palm Springs) which probably isn't much better but I'd definitely say visiting Victorville is not indicative of what Cali has to offer. Hehe, they call it Victimville.

Sandusky's wife issues statement
</headline>
<post author="RedheadBak..." datetime="2011-12-08T15:50:00" id="p1">
<a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8459203">http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8459203</a>
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. - December 8, 2011 (WPVI) -- About one month after her husband was charged with child sex crimes, and a day after he was arrested on additional charges, the wife of former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky broke her silence.

In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, Dottie Sandusky said:.
I want to thank our children, our family, our extended family of former Second Mile participants, and all our friends for standing by us through these difficult times. Jerry and I want to express our sorrow for all the hurt that has come to those who have supported us and our beloved Penn State and State College Communities.
I have been shocked and dismayed by the allegations made against Jerry, particularly the most recent one that a now young man has said he was kept in our basement during visits and screamed for help as Jerry assaulted him while I was in our home and didn't respond to his cries for help.
As the mother of six children, I have been devastated by these accusations. I am also angry about these false accusations that such a terrible incident ever occurred in my home. No child who ever visited our home was ever forced to stay in our basement and fed there. All the kids who visited us ate with us and our kids and other guests when they were at our home. Our children, our extended family and friends know how much Jerry and I love kids and have always tried to help and care for them. We would never do anything to hurt them. I am so sad anyone would make such a terrible accusation which is absolutely untrue. We don't know why these young men have made these false accusations, but we want everyone to know they are untrue.
I continue to believe in Jerry's innocence and all the good things he has done. Jerry's many success stories with his Second Mile kids and positive memories of those kids keep me going. I am asking everyone to please be reasonable and open-minded until both sides of this case are heard, and Jerry has the opportunity to prove his innocence.
I would like to thank all those individuals who continue to support Jerry and hope they will continue to support us through the conclusion of this very sad time in our lives.
Earlier Thursday, Jerry Sandusky left jail after posting $250,000 bail.
Sandusky secured his release using $200,000 in real estate holdings and a $50,000 certified check provided by Dorothy Sandusky, according to online court records.
The jail's warden said he was quiet and cooperative during his overnight stay.
A judge ordered the accused child sex abuser and former Penn State assistant football coach to be electronically monitored after he posts bail.
Sandusky's attorney says he will need to be out of jail to continue working on an aggressive defense against the allegations that he molested and sexually assaulted 10 young boys who were part of his Second Mile program.
RELATED: <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/feature?section=news&amp;id=8458482">WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT - Read the latest Grand Jury Report on Victims 9 and 10</a> (Mobile users: <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/uploadedFiles/Press/Sandusky-Presentment2-12-7-2011.pdf">CLICK HERE</a> )
At Sandusky's home Thursday morning the only activity was his wife, and a man who appeared to be his son, leaving.
There will be conditions to Sandusky's electronic monitoring. We don't know if he will be allowed to leave his home at certain times or to meet with his attorney.
"It will be the equivalent to house arrest," said Sandusky's attorney Joe Amandola. "Of course with the media people staked outside his house for the last 4 weeks, 5 weeks, he's basically been confined to his house except when he's come to see me."
We do know the judge ordered Sandusky to stay away from Penn State's campus and he can have no contact with minors or his alleged victims who are expected to testify in a preliminary hearing next week.
"My biggest immediate concern is for the protection of not only the victim who I represent but for the other victims who need to testify next week and preserving not only their identities but preserving their ability to lead normal and active full lives," attorney Tom Kline told Action News.
Sandusky was arrested Wednesday and charged with 12 new sex abuse counts involving two new alleged victims. He has maintained his innocence.
The latest accusers are the ninth and 10th alleged victims described in grand jury reports that claim Sandusky befriended and then molested boys he met through his Second Mile charity for troubled youth. A grand jury document released Wednesday echoed an earlier report, saying Sandusky gave the boys gifts while also making sexual advances toward them.
One of the new accusers said Sandusky kept him in a basement bedroom during overnight visits to Sandusky's home, forced him to perform sex acts and assaulted him.
"The victim testified that on at least one occasion he screamed for help, knowing that Sandusky's wife was upstairs, but no one ever came to help him," the grand jury report said.
Sandusky was charged last month with abusing eight boys, some on campus, over 15 years, allegations that were not immediately brought to the attention of authorities even though high-level people at Penn State apparently knew about them. In all, he faces more than 50 charges.
The scandal has resulted in the ousting of school President Graham Spanier and longtime coach Joe Paterno.

It's one thing to humiliate you in that way as a private citizen, it's another to do it in such a spectacularly public way. Also, it's one thing to have an affair, it's another to rape little boys.

He said, "we were 16, 17, 18 so maybe it's different because we were so much older". If it weren't 12 years ago, I'd make him report it to the school. At best, it's really, really creepy.

I think we need a guy to answer this, because their gym and showering experience is a lot different. In my high school, the girls had curtained individual shower stalls but the guys all showered together in an open room and the showerheads were arranged in pods.

DH told me that it didn't happen every day, but did happen from time to time if the coaches actually worked out with the team. However, that's a coach with an entire team- no one on one showers. And 10-12 year olds were not on a college football team, or wrestling team, or any other kind of team.

Right, I'm not trying to justify or lessen what he did at all. And I don't believe for one second that Sandusky just showered with the boys. I was just curious if showering with the team was normal or not.

To answer Sandsonik - I would much rather shower with a naked man than be raped by one, so there is a pretty big difference, lol. BUT I would much rather neither happened as both are repulsive.
My male Phys Ed teacher used to watch the boys shower very rarely. I never sensed that it was creepy - it only happened occasionally, and was usually because he wanted us to get out and go to the next class. But he never showered with us - that is a step waaayyyy to far. I don't think anyone would think this was okay. Then again, I am talking 11 year olds - 16 year olds. And in the UK. So who knows, maybe its okay in the USA? Seems unlikely tho.

Oh yeah, if it happens in phys ed, I would definitely think it was unusual. I could imagine there are high school team sports or college sports where it might not be beyond the pale though. A track or cross country coach is likely running right along with their team, maybe a high scool basketball coach gets as sweaty as the team.
Not saying Sandusky's behavior was normal, just that most of the people on this board are women and I don't think we're fair judges on what's normal male locker room activity! I would have loathed open showering, and TTT, we rarely if ever showered after PE in either middle school or high school. Guys were more likely to shower after PE - maybe were forced to, and team athletes of either sex were more likely to shower also.

Sounds like a bad edit job to me, too. I wouldn't put much past Santorum, but he was giving a speech here. To my mind, if he was going to drop the n bomb it would be more of a "spur of the moment" slip, not a planned speech.

Comment was around the 34 minute mark. I can't decide what to think. I want to say no way he was going to say that, but then I can't think of anything else that would make sense there, and why did he just stop mid-sentence and then skip to a whole new topic instead of finishing his thought?

I agree - bad edit job. I can't stand Santorum and he's said some crazy and aweful things before, but I do think he is disciplined enough to not make a gaffe like that during a planned speech. Truth be told, I can't see him dropping the N word even spur of the moment. He's been in politics way too long for that.

I am torn here. Like PP have said, I really can't imagine him saying it - if for nothing else, he has been in politics too long and knows too well the repercussions of using that word in any context or forum.
But I just can't figure out what else he would have been about to say that he apparently decided he could NOT say and so started an entirely new sentence.

I'm not a SAntorum fan at all, but I don't think he was going to use the n-word there. I think he called Obama a government-nik, like a peacenik, trying to invoke Communism more than anything. If for no other reason than that is a word that wouldn't come first to most people's minds, especially a non-Southern politician who needs to win people over.

Wouldn't surprise me based on the tone of voice he sometimes gets when he starts talking about blah people. It's like you can hear that every time he talks about them, he's picturing Al Sharpton wearing a bikini and wiping his butt with pages from the Bible while handing out guns to gangstas.

Yes. And this is the verse that Tim Tebow writes on his eye black. It was a "sign" last week because he passed for 316 yards, averaging 3.16 yards per throw, etc. <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-43.gif" alt="Confused"/>

They unquestionably have the right to say it. But listeners have the right to question, mock, disagree with, and judge the content of their speech, as well as the people who agree with, fund or merely support what has been said.
FOTF supports an enormous number of things that are incredibly harmful to a gigantic portion of this country. We can avoid same-sex marriage and still talk about a long, ugly and hateful list of things they stand for.

Marketing and advertising, actually. I have a BS in Marketing and I'm working on my masters. I'm sure some FOTF employee is going to have a great time reading this Monday. They got what they wanted, a response, a reaction, web traffic. They hit two target markets with one ad!

Yes, my opinion would change. I despise any and everything FOTF does. You say it was a cute ad. That doesn't change the fact that it was an AD, meaning they were ADVERTISING something.

If Tebow's fan club had did it, I probably would have just rolled my eyes.

See, here's the thing. You didn't need to point out that FOTF has a right to air the ad. Why? Because nobody said it didn't! They simply said they didn't like it. Because nobody argued that FOTF didn't have the right to air it, your reference to that right defended nothing.
You like the commercial. Other posters don't. The end. Leave the First Amendment out of it.

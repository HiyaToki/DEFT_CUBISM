Roundup: Colombia may face stiffer FARC opposition
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BOGOTA, June 24 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major Colombian rebel group blamed the election of former defense minister as
new president for instigating more conflicts in the country, local media
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) said in a statement published
by the Nueva Colombia News Agency on Thursday, that there will be an eventual
"radicalization of the political fight" following the election of Juan Manuel
Santos, a tough fighter against the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
"With the illegitimate triumph of the continuity political system, repudiated by
the abstention of the people, the country has entered a radicalization process
of the political fight, where the people are the main character on the front
line," the rebel group said.
</P>
<P>
"We are in for another four years of oligarchy offense against the people, in
all the orders, besmeared with official sweet and tricky promises around a
military victory as they have told us without stop for 46 years," said the FARC.
</P>
<P>
The group slammed the government's "Democratic Security" program for  enabling
it to "choose as president the defense minister who has boosted more (of) these
crimes against the humanity."
</P>
<P>
It was FARC's first public reaction since the former defense minister was
declared winner of Sunday's run-off of the 2010 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Santos was elected to replace outgoing President Alvaro Uribe, after
surpassing opposition candidate Antanas Mockus. Manuel Santos will take office
on August 7.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing Colombian president said Thursday he would request French President
Nicolas Sarkozy to help him re-capture Rodrigo Granda, a member of the FARC, who
was released in 2007 due to a petition from France.
</P>
<P>
"We accepted President Sarkozy's request to release Granda; tomorrow (Friday)
during the G8 meeting I will ask him to help me to re-capture him ... I will
tell Sarkozy that I have released that bandit, but it worked for nothing," Uribe
added.
</P>
<P>
Granda was detained in late 2004 in Venezuela by Colombian agents. The incident
of cross-border arrest aroused a diplomatic impasse between Caracas and Bogota,
which was later ironed out with the mediation of Cuban Leader Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
Granda was released to work as a mediator for the release of Colombia's former
presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, with both Colombian and French
nationalities, who had been taken hostage by the FARC.
</P>
<P>
Granda is accused by the Colombian justice and investigated in Paraguay for
kidnapping and murdering former Paraguay President Raul Cubas' daughter.
</P>
<P>
Invited by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper,President Uribe will attend
the G8 Summit scheduled for June 25 and 26 at Huntsville, Canada.

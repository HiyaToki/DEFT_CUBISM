SPORTS COLUMN: BEST OF RIVALS AND FRIENDS, THEN AND ALWAYS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"That's a woman thing," Chris Evert was saying the other
night.
</P>
<P>
Evert was talking about the bond between her and Martina
Navratilova, which grew only stronger as they played each other an
incredible 80 times.
</P>
<P>
Eighty times. Between the two best players of their age. This
sense of awe goes way beyond nostalgia into a sense of wonder over
glory days when two charismatic giants graced the courts.
</P>
<P>
There has probably never been a friendship between rivals to
match the one between Evert and Navratilova. Their relationship has
been touchingly captured in a documentary, "Unmatched," for the
ESPN series 30 for 30,which will be shown Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. Open begins Monday, both women remind us to see the
big picture, to acknowledge our colleagues and even our
competitors, to tap our racket over somebody else's shot, to
respect the other, whatever the other may be.
</P>
<P>
Chatting before a preview in New York, Evert said the "woman
thing" came from Billie Jean King, who convinced younger players
they had a stake in building women's tennis. Evert does not take
credit, but she also brought the ethics of her family into the
locker room, where she smiled (maybe to intimidate, but also to
greet) at the newcomer from Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
At that first tournament, in 1973 in Akron, Ohio, Evert looked
through the recently acquired pounds and saw the athlete who could
beat her. In the documentary, Evert takes a deep breath and
confides to the camera that Navratilova, at her best, was better
than Evert at her best. It takes Evert-like guts to make that
admission. She also won 37 of their 80 meetings.
</P>
<P>
They are constantly in touch -- sometimes in the middle of the
night, when either needs a supportive ear or shoulder. The
documentary does not mention that Navratilova recently had a bout
with breast cancer or that she is training for a December hike up
Mount Kilimanjaro; it alludes to Evert's three divorces.
</P>
<P>
These two peripatetic women always promised each other that they
would sit down someday and have a glass of wine and open up to each
other. To a very satisfying degree, the producer Hannah Stormand
the directors Nancy Stern Winters and Lisa Lax (twins who grew up
idolizing both players) popped the cork and let the cameras roll.
</P>
<P>
Some of the revelations are touching. Navratilova looks at Evert
and recalls that as she came to grips with her sexuality, Evert
was, in her words, gay-friendly. Navratilova thanks her.
</P>
<P>
On Sundays, they were often the last women left, dressing in the
same locker room, arranging practice together, lunching together --
and going out to play a final, 60 times in 16 years. Afterward, the
winner would be careful of the loser's feelings. For many years,
they would then travel together to the next tournament. Imagine
that.
</P>
<P>
"Before I even met her, she stood for everything I admired in
this country: poise, ability, sportsmanship, money, style,"
Navratilova said in her autobiography, "Martina," published in
1985. In the book, which I co-wrote, Navratilova raved about
Evert's mother, Colleen: "From the first time I appeared on the
tour, I got the feeling she honestly felt bad when I lost and happy
when I won."
</P>
<P>
The two players recall the time in the early '80s when Nancy
Lieberman, the great red shark of women's basketball, convinced
Navratilova that she had to feel hostility toward her major
opponent. They got through it.
</P>
<P>
Male athletes, by contrast, are much more catty. Witness the
disdain between Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe and the way Andre
Agassi dissed Pete Sampras in his recent book. Bill Russell and
Wilt Chamberlain did stay respectful, even when Russell won the
titles, but Joe Frazier still hates Muhammad Ali for calling him a
gorilla in the flammable rhetoric of their time.
</P>
<P>
I used to think the two women were wise enough to know they
needed each other in their athletic old age, which, in a fractious
world, is no small thing. But the documentary convinced me that
Evert and Navratilova were closer than I had realized. They drive
around autumnal eastern Long Island in a convertible, an athletic
Thelma and Louise, telling good stories on themselves -- or each
other.
</P>
<P>
In her sardonic burlesque-queen tone, Evert recalls being single
and ogling Dino Martin, handsome son of Dean. To Evert's chagrin,
Dino asked her if he could get a date with Martina because he liked
her buff physique. They eventually went on a double date, where
apparently nothing happened; Navratilova explains that she was
still figuring herself out. Evert rolls her eyes, suggesting that
after a chaste date with Dino, her pal could have figured it out.
</P>
<P>
Evert then tells how Navratilova returned the favor by
introducing her to a handsome skier named Andy Mill, who escorted a
panicked Evert down a steep trail in Colorado. He was so gallant,
Evert married him -- for 18 good years, she adds. Evert also thanks
her buddy for lending her Aspen bedroom for Evert's first tryst
with Mill. That's what friends are for, right?
</P>
<P>
The documentary also shows artful passing shots and acrobatic
volleys, steely glares and emotional meltdowns, all over the tennis
globe. "Unmatched" takes nothing away from today's tennis, while
acknowledging that there was never anything quite like Chris and
Martina.

      Ford pays


      back its


      chairman
</P>
<P>
Bill Ford Jr. collects $16M in salary and stock options earned
over past two years
</P>
<P>
By Alisa Priddle


      The Detroit News
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co., in another sign of its financial comeback, is
writing Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. a big paycheck to make up
for some of the five years he declined to take a salary.
</P>
<P>
The automaker announced Friday that Bill Ford will get $4.2
million in salary and stock options of about $11.6 million. That's
what he would have gotten, had he been paid from 2008 until now --
minus a 30 percent pay cut that the company's top executives agreed
to swallow for 2009 and 2010.
</P>
<P>
"Executives are there to contribute and be rewarded in an
appropriate manner," said auto industry researcher Rebecca
Lindland of IHS Automotive in Lexington, Mass. "This shows Ford is
back on track and being run the way a company should be in a
capital market.
</P>
<P>
"It's a return to normalcy."
</P>
<P>
Despite the big payday for Bill Ford, it could still be some
time before the automaker is convinced its financial footing is
firm enough to resume paying dividends to its stockholders.
Dividends were cancel ed in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Bill Ford sold $28 million of his shares Friday; some will go
toward repaying loans he took out in the dark days of 2004 and 2005
to buy $14 million in Ford stock, as a show of faith in the
company. Since then, crosstown rivals General Motors and Chrysler
declared bankruptcy, received government bailouts, shed debt and
regrouped as new companies.
</P>
<P>
Ford, however, won public favor for declining government
assistance. Buyers have embraced its vehicles, which continue to
improve in quality.
</P>
<P>
"Even during the difficult times for our company and the
industry, I never doubted that our efforts at Ford would be
successful," Bill Ford said in a note to employees obtained by The
Detroit News.
</P>
<P>
"I continued to invest in our company's future by purchasing
Ford stock, at times, taking out personal loans to do so."
</P>
<P>
Ford's success, he said, "is my life's work, and I am fully
confident we are on track for sustained profitable growth through
our commitment to building great products, a strong business and a
better world."
</P>
<P>
In his note, Bill Ford announced he is donating $1 million to a
college scholarship fund for employees' children.
</P>
<P>
The great-grandson of founder Henry Ford announced in May 2005
that he would forgo compensation until the company showed sustained
profits. The automaker was restructuring, and jobs and costs were
being cut at all levels.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Bill Ford held the top three positions: chairman,
president and chief executive officer. He felt an obligation to
participate in the companywide sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
"It was a more prolonged downturn than anyone thought it would
be when Bill made the pledge," Ford spokesman Mark Truby said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The company's compensation committee decided in 2008 that when
the company met certain profitability conditions, Bill Ford's
compensation would be paid retroactive to Jan. 1, 2008. He will not
recoup the millions he could have earned from 2005 to 2008.
</P>
<P>
When the four-member compensation committee met this week, it
decided that after four profitable quarters, it was time for Bill
Ford to get some back pay, Truby said.
</P>
<P>
The details were released in a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing.
</P>
<P>
"The company is clearly performing well enough that the board
felt comfortable doing this," said analyst Joe Phillippi of
AutoTrends Consulting Inc. in Short Hills, N.J.
</P>
<P>
Bill Ford and CEO Alan Mulally, who made $14 million in salary
and $17.9 million total, could have their 30 percent pay cut
restored when the committee meets at the end of this year to
determine 2011 salaries.
</P>
<P>
Ford made $2.7 billion in 2009, its first annual profit in four
years. It earned $2.6 billion in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
But the automaker has said it won't resume stock dividends until
its credit rating climbs back to investment grade -- which will
reduce its borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
It's moving in the right direction: Fitch Ratings on Friday
upgraded Ford and Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC to BB- from B.
</P>
<P>
But that's still three notches below investment grade, said
Stephen Brown, Fitch's senior director of corporate finance in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
On Monday Standard &amp; Poor's raised Ford's credit rating by two
notches, to B-plus, the fourth-highest junk rating, and said the
company could be upgraded again over the next year. Ford's S&amp;P
credit rating is at nearly a four-year high.
</P>
<P>
"It will take time to get up three more notches," said Fitch's
Brown.
</P>
<P>
Progress will come faster, he said, if the auto industry as a
whole continues to improve, and Ford keeps prices up and costs
down, enabling it to break even with lower sales.
</P>
<P>
Ratings agencies want to see Ford pay down more of its $27
billion in debt. At the company's annual meeting in May, Bill Ford
confirmed the focus was on paring its debt. The automaker repaid $7
billion in the second quarter.

DU QUOIN, Illinois (AP) -- Things got hairy for parody singer "Weird Al" Yankovic as a flock of unwanted fans rushed onstage during his performance at a state fair in southern Illinois.

Green moths swarmed Yankovic, some nesting in his trademark long curly locks.

"My band asked me if I could find a concert where we would be attacked by insects," Yankovic told his audience Wednesday at the Du Quoin State Fair. "I said I would see what I could do."

Yankovic didn't seem bugged by the uninvited guests, though, as he plugged along with songs and costume changes during his self-described "rock and comedy multimedia extravaganza" to support his recent album, "Poodle Hat."

Weird Al Yankovic
» A Complicated Song

Uh huh... extra cheese
Uh huh, uh huh... save a piece for me

Pizza party at your house
I went just to check it out
Nineteen extra larges
What a shame
No one came

Just us eatin' all alone
You said, "Take the pizza home"
"No sense lettin' all this go to waste"
So then I faced

Pizza all day
And every day
This cheese 'round the clock
Is gettin' me blocked
And I sure don't care
For irregularity

Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make me so constipated?
'Cause right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated
In the bathroom... I sit and I wait and I strain
And I sweat and I clench and I feel the pain
Oh, should I take laxatives or have my colon irrigated?
No no no

I was feelin' pretty down
'Till my girlfriend came around
We're just so alike in every way
I gotta say

In fact, I just thought I might
Pop the question there that night
I was kissing her so tenderly
But woe is me

Who would have guessed
Her family crest
I'd suddely spy
Tattooed on her thigh
And son-of-a-gun
It's just like the one on me

Tell me
How was I supposed to know we were both related?
Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin we never would have dated
What to do now? Should I go ahead and propose
And get hitched and have kids with eleven toes
And move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated?
No no no no no no no
No no no no no no no
No no no no no

I had so much on my mind
I thought maybe I'd unwind
Try out that new roller coaster ride
And the guide

Said not to stand
But that's a demand
That I couldn't meet
I got on my feet
And stood up instead
And knocked off my head, you see

Tell me
Why'd I have to go and get myself decapitated?
This really is a major inconvenience, oh man, I really hate it
Such a drag, now... Can't eat, I can't breathe, I can't snore
I can't belch or yodel anymore
Can't spit or blow my nose or even read Sports Illustrated

Oh no
Why'd I have to go and get myself all mutilated? (yeah, yeah)
I gotta tell ya, life without a head kinda makes me irritated
What a bummer
Can't blink, I can't cough, I can't sneeeze
But my neck is enjoyin' a pleasant breeze now
Haven't been the same since my head and I were separated
No no no

I know at least timber is a fellow Packer Backer, but I think I've seen mention of a few others. The Pack have been soooooooo fun to watch this year, and as playoffs loom, I'd love to talk about 'em.

Wasn't yesterday's game great?? The commentators kept saying how boring it was, but I loved it. 13 degree windchill old fashioned Lambeau football. With occasional flashes of brilliance.

The sozlet has been duly indoctrinated, and yesterday said, unprompted, "Brett throws the football to Donnie!" She also loves yelling "Bubbbbbaaaaa!" when Mr. Franks does something noteworthy. That's in addition to doing the "touchdown" signal, "holding", and a few others. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/>

Anyway, do you think they can make it to the Superbowl this year? I think they can if they get homefield advantage, but not sure if Tampa Bay or Philly will be accommodating.

I only watch one or two football games per season. But I root for Green Bay ( Los Empacadores de la Bahía Verde ).

I'm with them, since I watched how they turned over a game against the Rams, in 1967-68.

I was a Packer when Bart Starr was QB.
A Packer when Bret Favre is QB
And, yes, a Packer when David Whitehurst was QB.
Count me in.

That's a Packer of long standing! Good for you. I'm not exactly fair-weather but I got on board at just the right time; namely, one year before the appearance of Brett. (Had moved to Madison in '89, retained a stubborn Vikings allegiance for a few years, realized the Vikes sucked and I didn't even like 'em much, switched over when it was still Majik [remember him? oy].)

I own stock, too. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/>

The Vikes played beautifully two or three seasons ago. Now they are where they should be.

His eyes are glued to the T.V. screen when the Packers play.
The Pack is back again! I imagine they will be in the playoffs.
The Superbowl? Only time will tell. There are a few other great teams out there.

They call themseles "cheeseheads", not packerheads.
I've never put anything orange on my head.
Another thing that is big here in packerland is tailgating at football games.
Is that popular everywhere else too?
I' m by no means a diehard Packers fan. I haven't even made it to one of their home games. We did manage to go to one of their inter squad scrimages awhile back.
It would be much easier to bundle up and take the drive to see a Badger game, then a Packer game.

jjorge, I groaned! Loud! Long! (I actually had a cheesehead for a while in the Superbowl season, but I admit to getting rid of it -- the stuff they make it out of smells funny.)

Goldie, Green Bay is just a nice little Midwestern community, which is awfully proud of its Packers for good reason. Not sure if I would want to live there, but glad it exists.

Keeping everything crossed in hopes that they beat the Jets -- REALLY want homefield advantage...

I could never live there the winters are to cold. I should note that for children growing up it is a great place to live. There are all sorts of activities for the young. Many of which I understand are sponsored and supported by the Packers.

You can forget about that home field advantage, and so can the Packers.
They sure didn't play very well today. The Jets on the other hand had all the spark, and had something to play for, which they did, and did it well.

I love 'em anyway. Sad, but love 'em. Donald Driver getting knocked out of the game so early didn't help one bit. Brett always starts out jittery then settles down, especially when he has favorite targets like Donald around to help him. I think everyone was really thrown by that.

Hi all,
I visited SF for the first time last Fall. I stayed w. my brother David and his family for two days and three nights. Because we spent so much time gabbing and catching up, and because my bro and his wife have two pre-schoolers, we only got out and about a little bit. Nevertheless, I saw and did enough to realize what a great city it is to visit.

I'm not sure if competing plans will allow me to go to SF this year but if you have a gathering I'll give it some serious thought.

Ah, SF is a lovely city. Went there on the tail-end of our honeymoon, plus I was there to audit (well, I was in Oakland, but the CPA and I went to SF for dinner and stuff). Oh, and I went with a female friend a couple of years ago, when I had an enormous amount of vacation time and frequent flyer miles to burn, and Mr. Jespah had no vacation time.

SF is fun but it's an expensive place. Hard to find decent lodging and food for cheap unless you're willing to sacrifice safety and taste, respectively. It's not impossible, but it isn't an easy task.

I have crossed the GGB dozens of times and it is always spectacular. But here's another suspension bridge I have crossed only twice (once each way). It is much larger than the GGB, five miles long in all, and the suspension portion is approximately 30% larger as well. This is a picture of Big Mac, which connects Michigan's upper peninsula to the lower, crossing the straits of Mackinac (say "mack-in-naw"). It has a grated road surface so you can look down at the water below you (scary).

Kinda feel like the other bridges around SF get overshadowed by the Golden Gate. Lots of other bridges around there, and the Bay Bridge is probably the greater engineering feat.

cjh and Piffka, Those photos of bridges you provided look more contemporary, but it shrinks in its majestic stature to the Golden Gate Bridge.

PD -- Yes, but (a yes-but sentence!) it is the suspension bridges that get all the glory. It's unfair to steel plate girders, deck trusses, and cantilever bridges, but they just don't get folks excited. That Oakland Bay Bridge should surely be getting more PR -- it has TWO suspension bridges.

chjsa -- A small world... GH is where I was raised &amp; still live. I've been across the Narrows Bridge thousands of times and walk my dogs on the beach below the span. They love it!

Thanks for pointing out the Big Mac bridge. Gosh, that must be a fabulous drive.

CI -- I'm sure you're right -- the Golden Gate is the most photographed.

As a very old fetus, the Golden Gate was apparently my bridge of choice. I was among the last to cross it, firmly enscounced in my mother's womb, on the day when it was first closed for high winds. My mum was so worried that she nearly had me prematurely! Apparently it was swinging wildly in both directions. But she held off and so did I, not making my appearance until a couple of weeks later.

I was so disappointed (later) to find that it was NOT golden colored. Nearly distressed, I was. Orange? It's a stinkin' orange color? Oh well, here's a good shot. Most of the pictures don't do it justice because it IS so big:

I plan to be there for any get together. Worry a little about the date, as we have our gallery openings at the first sat evening of the month, and I don't know when that falls re the date.

The drive to SF from where I live is about five hours and beautiful. I suppose we need to stay in the city. I stayed two years ago at the Galleria Park hotel, one of SF's renovated oldies...at 109 a night for a single. Long story how that happened, but it was a place of relief and respite, and only a couple of blocks from Union Square. Actually, I typed the story here but lost it, my computer cursor froze and I had to shut down and reup, and here I am again, sans the story.

I really loved the location, and doubt we could find a lot better.

On the other hand, I stayed in Inverness in Marin County, near Point Reyes, last summer, a glorious place, and that was cheaper, since I stayed in a quite tacky-wonderful hotel there by the name of the Golden Hinde. A friend and I, he from another city, shared a suite including kitchen, for $144. a night.

Point Reyes is out toward the ocean from Petaluma...one absolutely gorgeous drive. And the tacky/ok motel is right on an inlet waterway....

On the other hand of the other hand, when my business partner and I go to SF from our town 300 miles north - for example to the shipping yard of Au Pottery in Oakland, or to a supplier of ironwork in Petaluma...we stay either at Day's Inn in Rohnert Park (around 37.00 a night for two queen beds) or a Travel Lodge type place near by, which is less, but, y'know, less.

This would only work if people rented cars...and one of the beauties of San Francisco is that you can take city transport. M'self, I like that Galleria Park, or one of the many other renovated oldie hotels. I think Beresford Arms (or some name like that) is another one. I think they are all pretty well located and run around a hundred a night...which sounds like a lot of money until you check what it costs to stay in the great hotels.

Hmm, you want me to check what it costs to stay in the great hotels?

The first week of April, 2004, in San Francisco is certainly something to think about. I'd suggest that the first order of business would be to find a host who can accomodate the gathering. With people coming great distances to meet and visit with other A2Kers, it is important to have some quiet central place where talk can go on for hours at a time. I doubt that many restaurants, even in San Francisco would suit our purpose. Where will the gathering be centered?

Once that is out of the way, acceptable hotels in the vicinity can be scouted. San Francisco rooms are expensive, but transportation there is very reasonable and accessable. If Natalie and I are able to come over for the gathering, our youngest son would probably be able to find a place for us. Finding an acceptable restaurant in San Francisco shouldn't be difficult at all. The Empress of China in Chinatown used to serve outstanding meals, and there are so many other great locations that the difficulty would be in just choosing one. Drinks at the Top of the Mark would be very nice.

Side trips down to Big Sur, or up to the Woods would be great, but if the Albuquerque experience is any indication, most folks will end up sitting around the Gathering's central location in discussion. There were nine in Albuquerque, but San Francisco may draw twice that many. Someone on the ground there should begin planning very soon.

The cooking forum from another site I frequent does an annual get-together on the west coast - they seem to alternate between Seattle and S.F. They usually book their rooms through Priceline.com. Last year they got rooms at one of Seattle's 4-star hotels for $40/night, split between 2 people. They're planning this year's get-together right now. 4 to 6 months lead-time seems to work well, with the bookings happening in the final 2 months. One of the women in the group is taking a course at the C.I.A. - that took a booking a year in advance!

Asherman, All wise suggestions, and I hope you'll be availble for consults. I'll start looking for quiet Gathering place(s), but it would help a great deal if we knew how many plan to attend. I agree with ehBeth's 4 - 6 months lead-time for bookings for most venues, hotels, and such. Most venues will not accept reservations any earlier. However, the SF Culinary Academy requires much more lead time, and that'll be impossible unless we have a head count. We can plan side trips to Big Sur, Carmel, Sausalito, the Sonoma/Napa Wine country (many good restaurants), Muir Woods, and the Jelly Belly Candy Factory for those interested. As for finding good hotel rates, try several web sites such as "priceline, hotel.com, AAA, AARP, and travel magazines. I"ll post more options for finding good prices on hotel rooms in the future. Finally, I need assistance to prepare for this gathering. Somebody out there needs to volunteer. c.i.

Just a quick thought. For those of us who aren't retired or self-employed, one of the factors in terms of committing to the trip is vacation scheduling. I won't know until mid-January next year, at the earliest, whether I'd be able to get time off at the right time (and i wouldn't travel that far without making at least a week trip of the whole adventure).

Cicerone,

Another option for side trips you might consider is brunch or tea at the Sheraton Palace garden. That is always a wonderful experience for visitors to The City.

Another spot of interest might be City Lights Bookstore. "City Lights (261 Columbus Ave. near Broadway, 415/362-8193) is perhaps the city's most famous bookstore. Owned by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the store was a hangout for the members of the Beat Generation in the 50's and 60's, with many Beat poets giving readings there. Ferlinghetti is still the owner, and City Lights is still a good bookstore, especially for poetry, contemporary literature, politics, sociology, and philosophy. "

The Palace of Fine Arts and Exploratorium would also be of interest to the arts and science minded folks.

No sequence of thought here, just riffing.

Perhaps we could rent a suite at some great hotel. I think the Sir Frances Drake is still kicking and the St. Francis certainly is. But by definition, that might be biggy bucks.

I have my own peculiar needs, in that it is hard for me to park in downtown sf, being nightblind, I can't drive into garages. But never mind, I can spring once a year for a valet. Not cheerfully.

I am not interested myself in meeting at some airport hotel. This is one of the great cities of the world, we can't do that, imho. There are, as I mentioned before, at least one set and perhaps several more sets, of renovated oldie hotels, not lux but not horrible - pretentions to suave, like wine in the lobby in late afternoon - and fairly centrally located. The one I mentioned before that I stayed at was right in the heart of things, and completely congenial.

Restaurants, top of the line at any level. Don't get me started. I have the last four years' worth of the SF chronicle reviews of best restaurant summaries in my travel file at work. Just ask.

My main question to all is -- do you want to meet outside of town for less expensive and possible also beautiful, like the strange and wonderful place, but not necessarily that one, that I stayed in Inverness last year, and make SF a day trip,

or

stay in SF at a moderate hotel in city, as in one of those I just mentioned,

or an expensive one, trip of a lifetime, and some of us could stay in the lesser than swankos....but if some were in the greats, then we could perhaps meet off and on in the bar/restaurant of one. I for one like the breakfast cafe at the St. Francis. And, the good part, the food was good and I was almost alone in the restaurant with my sunday edition of the NYT when I went there on a short walk from my Galleria park hotel, around ten on a sunday morning.

Or at a Days Inn or travellodge away from town, like Rohnert Park or similar places an hour out of town, and group for trips to the city. That runs for about $37 a night and is perfectly clean, freeway close, not gross.
I have stayed there about five times, fine. I suppose we could gather by the pool-ette.

There is one more place that can be booked and often is, called Asilomar. University types often meet there, it is in Pacific Grove, I think....not an easy access to sf, exactly. But it could be rentable, I think, if I would only look it up, as a site for all of us, and we could get group transportation going to the city.
Asilomar is, I think, beautiful, and one can do lots of gorgeous walks. I think it is by the Monterey aquarium and the 17 mile drive. People go there to talk philosophy, great books, etc. This is Steinbeck's area, albeit more pricey now.
Finally, we could meet at some airport hotel, like I just slammed. Well, I think that is easily as expensive as some charming renovated place in town but they would surely be convenient to SFO...which could be really useful.

Which brings up...would everybody come into sfo...there are good airports in San Jose and Oakland as well.

Complicated subject, this, good we are starting to talk relatively early.

A friend and I took a cross-country trip recently. We spent at least two hours on the internet trying to find the best deal for where we were going. We finally ended up booking through expedia.com. It was $200 lower than the next highest site we looked at (I can't remember which one that was). That was for airfare and 4 nights hotel. You can get hotel prices only, airfare only, or a combination. You travelers might want to check that out.

osso, All good suggestions. I think San Francisco might be affordable right now, because of the high vacancy rates experienced since 9-11. If people want to opt for a more economical location, there are plenty between San Francisco and San Jose. If people are interested, I can contact several hotels in San Francisco to see if we can get some group rates. I think San Francisco would be a good home base, because many optional day tours up north or south would be readily available. Parking in San Francisco is not recommended, because it'll cost an arm and a leg, and part of your torso - and that's if your brains survive. Millbrae through San Francisco, and up and down the East Bay has Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). San Jose to San Francisco has Cal Train. San Jose has the Rosecrucian Egyptian Museum and Winchester Mystery House. Santa Clara has Great America. Vallejo has Sea World. We need to get some feedback on what your desires are concerning 1) cost and location of lodging, 2) number of days, 3) day tours, 4) and interests. San Francisco also just opened a new Asian Art Museum. Pier 39 has a seaworld where you walk in plastic tubes, and you see the fishes, sharks, and other sea life all around you. Sorry about the disorganized manner in which this is presented, but I'm typing as I think of them. Any volunteers? c.i.

I know Sf moderately well, or somewhat well. CI, am trying to figure out what others might want too. I did stay once a couple of years ago at some big pink motel in Milbrae that was airport related, did have a bus to town. It was the exact same price as that room at the Galleria Park, just over $100./night. Where people might want to stay will depend on where their planes land, and their own inclinations, plus perhaps where the main group is gathering. Me, I will (I am thinking now, way ahead) will probably try to stay in the city.

The thing about that motel in Milbrae was it could have been anywhere...on the other hand, it had a certain efficient convenience.

Natalie and I will want to be either in, or close to San Francisco. Our youngest son is there and we've been promising a visit for several years. If we were to begin listing the enticements of San Francisco at 20/day we wouldn't exhaust the list between now and next June.

Our recent experience is that the attendees far prefer sitting around in a large circle talking for hours to even the best side/day trip. Folks here saw little beyond their hotel rooms and Corazon, yet I don't think anyone was too disappointed. It is the opportunity for direct interaction that draws participants together, and everything else is secondary. We tend to be older people, so quiet venues that make hearing less a problem are preferable. The Corazon group couldn't get through an hour without lighting up, so the ready availability of a place to smoke while carrying on conversation would be a big plus. We probably overdid the snacks and food, but cold drinks were very popular. The most popular drink was tea. Diet sodas and ice water were much more in demand than alcoholic drinks. I think that during the entire event no more than five beers were drunk, and a wonderful bottle of tequila brought by Frbaezer is still unopened. Usually our guests belly up to the bar for a shot of single malt Islay, but not the A2Kers. Sitzkreig was the order of the day in Albuquerque, and I believe that's likely to be the group's preference for the San Francisco gathering as well.

If those of you in relatively close proximity of San Francisco would get together either here, or by PM, it may be possible to figure out some central venue that meets the basic criteria for a central gathering place. That is the sine qua non, in my opinion, for successfully planning the April '04 event. Get that set and everything else will fall into place.

I know the frustration of trying to plan without knowing how many to provide for. Unfortunately, getting a good count is probably impossible. Many folks want to attend, but as the time grows shorter the obstacles increase in size and number. At one point we expected the number of attendees for the Western Gathering to be between 12 and 16. We ended with nine, and three of those were "in-town". Of course, we are further off the beaten path than San Francisco. On the other hand, the cost of coming to Corazon were miniscule compared to the costs of spending 3-14 days in San Francisco.

Asilomar is quite nice but for those who don't know, it's a bit spartan. There are very nice motels &amp; B&amp;B's that border Asilomar, which offer more amenities. One thing I'm always after is a hot tub. We like to bring our bikes as it's a great place to ride.

One time though, I was walking the beach below Asilomar and there was this horrid smell. Then I realized that the large rock in front of me wasn't a rock at all - it was a dead elephant seal. Blech!

Well, I hadn't advanced to the idea that we would all stay at one place as a group. The more I think about it, the more I can see that is a good idea. People may have different needs...and given the tremendous number of wonderful things to do in SF, including places to eat...there may well be free time demands. (I am apt to split off and do some galleries, for example, well, let me not even get started on stuff to do.) So...if not one hotel for all, the hotels should be real close, or we'll all be in town individually at the same time.

Maybe we should try to nail down a place for a basic number by some reasonable date and later people to join in could at least have it as a central place to get to, if not stay at.

I agree about the need for quiet, and I am hard of hearing too, and one of my funnier meetings with online friends was when three of us met in a previously known to be quiet place and had to write notes for the first part of the lunch. At least the core place should be quiet, the city outside doesn't have to be.

I am apt to have a scotch or a glass of wine, hope there'll be someone to join me!

Here's some guidelines on rates at Asilomar, but remember these are for 2003: Singles $136.21 - $282.41; Doubles $89.17 - $140.75; Triple $70.46 - $93.71; and 4+ $69.05 - $69.90.

Here's the place I stayed in Inverness on Tomales Bay. It is closer to SF than
Monterey...it is out on the coast via a beautiful drive from Petaluma. So this represents a type of alternative to the main City.

What is good about it...there are a few suites, I stayed in one. The living room and kitchen of one could be our main place, and we all get individual rooms.
Also, area is gorgeous. Very good restaurant nearby, at Manka's Inn, where my friends' wedding was held. (Monka's Inn would be a neat choice, but it is 185.00 a night and up up up. Also, quite small.)
Is near Point Reyes Station and Point Reyes...lovely.

What is bad about it...a tad on the ticky tacky side. And distance from SF, re time...people would have to have cars.

Here's where we can't stay....Manka's Inn. On the other hand, maybe some could. It is wonderful..sigh.

Plus the bridal party dinner the night before the wedding was held at yet another wonderful restaurant, about three miles south. Sigh again.

As a matter of fact, I prefer north of San Francisco over south of. Even Mendocino is a fantastic area with many rustic B&amp;B's and towns. It has a relax feeling to it that never leaves you even after you depart the location. My wife and I stayed at Elk Cove Inn some years ago, and I still rememer the comfortable room and surroundings, and the excellent food they served. The Guest Book at the Elk Cove Inn shows visitors from all corners of the world, and they have expressed all positive comments. When you walk down to the beach, their dog will walk down with you, and keep you company. c.i.

I would be up for Mendocino, easy for me to say...but it would be harder for others to get to, being further from SF.

Look at Manka's - I was saying it was too small and expensive, but the prices seem to have gone down since my friends' wedding, or else they had grown in my mind, and it isn't that much more pricey relative to what people often pay for hotels. It is just high for me. The site does explain about group events though. And, damn, the food is good.

I suppose it would be undemocratic to have a two tiered economic get together..people in my financial set could stay at tacky but comfy enough Golden Hinde, and the highendbrigade could stay at Manka's and we could all visit them and their decks in the trees. Manka's is just a few blocks up the hill in the town of Inverness. If people are really watching the bucks, I have stayed at Days Inn in Rohnert Park and Motel 6 or similar in Petaluma, they're at least ok, and position you in between Inverness/Point Reyes and the Big City by the Bay.

I'm going to explore for an area map, back soon.

And people could get to SF fast enough (1 hour usually) together or separately.

And we can keep looking. I just happen to be off today, and had my eyes dilated at the opthamologist's, so I am not out in the sunshine or doing errands.

I guess I should explain why I am eyeing Pt. Reyes and Inverness and that area so closely...

Once you go north on highway 101 out of SF, and turn west at Petaluma, housing and towns fall away. The land is under some trust/state park, and so it is just one good drive through land, something like a half hour to get to Pt. Reyes Station/Inverness. You can then turn north, should you wish and go up to Tomales and Dillon Beach, but they are of course further.

Here's a Marin County Planning Guide that lists a large number of possible meeting sites. I like the closeness to San Francisco, and know from past experience that it is a beautiful area. There appears to be a pretty good selection of area hotels, though we might find acceptable accomodations at the central site. There are at least two items that need to be checked: prices and transportation to/from Oakland Airport (29 miles, but closer and probably less expensive to fly into than SFX) and San Francisco.

Re: airports (posting out of nostalgia for NorCal, mainly) -- it's been my experience in recent years that it's easier (and sometimes cheaper) to fly into Oakland than SF, but that rental cars are generally cheaper in SF.

San Jose's a bear to fly in and out of these days, but there's an off-chance that fares or cars will be cheaper than either Bay Area airport.

Cicero,

We are probably too far out to get any reliable numbers. Its hard to make a commitment that far in advance. At best you may survey to determine interest for the event. To get useful responses you will need to have the time/place pretty well nailed down. Factors important in dividing those who "want to attend" from those who "actually attend" are: schedule availability, will they be "free" at the chosen time; cost/affordability, many of us are retired living on pensions and must carefully budget just to get through each month, and; closely related to cost is distance, short distances are easier and less daunting to those nearby who are most likely to attend.

You may want to concentrate your early efforts on those who live in, or near the Bay area. If you can locate a local group, they will be invaluable in putting together the affair. That will establish your minimum expected group. Those who can attend by driving for 8 hours, or less, comprise your second most likely group of attendees. The next most likely group will be able to fly into Oakland from surrounding and adjacent States, or western Canada. Beyond those are the continental visitors who have to fly considerable distance, and who may need to go through the Customs game. Those who come the furtherest, on the other hand, need the greatest lead time to prepare and make their decisions.

To survey the group, I believe, you will need to first send personal messages to those you can identify in the various zones surrounding the meeting site. That is much more managable and effective, than trying to contact everyone within the total set. The more solid information you can supply in that first contact, the better the chance you will get usable results from the survey. When, where, and how much will it cost are absolute minumums you will need to offer early on. There will be some for whom the initial "plan" won't work, so some flexibility needs to be retained over the next few months. Refinement of the process can take place later.

You might also want to poll the principals of earlier gatherings to determine how many attended, and for "lessons learned".

Hope this helps.

Ashman, Your input is always welcome. Trying to concentrate on costs is going to be difficult; it's difficult to project the cost of transportation and lodging this early in the game. Most lodging places don't even have 2004 rates published or unpublished. Airfare is another biggie that seems to roller coaster from one week to the next. We might have about 15 people somewhat committed to come next April, but alot can happen between now and then. (I'm just trying to be realistic.) Maybe, it is too early to try and establish anything this early, and we should just keep it open for the people interested to decide on venues. I'll wait for more suggestions. c.i.
</post>
<post author="Asherman" datetime="2003-06-06T17:38:00" id="p126">
Correct, costs will almost certainly change over the next ten months. However, finding a venue is vital and prices are unlikely to vary much within the planning time-frame. Marin County seems a pretty good alternative to the high costs in the City, but those of you on the ground there are in a better position to scout the possibilities. Let us say that you, or a local committee if you feel the need to spread the decision-making, decided to use the Marin Suites (wholly hyothetical, of course). You can be reasonably sure that rooms can be had for between $150-$255 for a 2-3 night stay. You can also easily project the transportation costs between the Oakland Airport and the hotel. Count the number of meals, and estimate the cost per meal. The sum of these figures will give you a reasonable estimate of what it would cost an out-of-town participant to attend. Airfare can't easily be estimated because you don't know where the participants might come from, so leave that entirely to the potential participants to arrange.

The first step, I think, is to see who is interested and lives in the Bay area, or its immediate environs. Those folks will be your core group, and most likely participants. They can help in finding a low-cost central location for the event. Probably you will want to find a reasonable hotel where most of the participants will opt to stay. Renting a meeting hall adds costs that would have to be born by the participants, thus driving up cost. Find a hotel whose accomodations will make it possible for the group to meet in one, or more, of the participant's rooms, and you will have solved that problem (that's one of the reasons I sorta like something similar to the Marin Suites, hotel rooms that do double duty). By involving others who live in the immediate area, you have a much better chance of finding the "best" value available.

Ten months isn't a long time, and as the time grows short difficulties will inevitably arise. The more you have things lined up well in advance, the fewer nasty surprises that get out of control are likely to occur. Much of the pre-planning/decision-making can, and should, be done on the ground by the sponsor(s). The more people you expect to attend, the greater the planning challenge. Having the next door neighbors over for dinner on the patio is easy, but if you are catering a blacktie dinner as a fund raiser for a political candidate the task is just a little more complicated.

Survey outward from what you expect to be groud-zero. In the closest zone your probability of getting firm commitments and actual attendance is greatest. Those probabilities steadily decrease as the distance increases. You can't control the statistics much beyond insuring that the venue is affordable, easy to reach, and attractive to potential attendees.

Don't put off beginning the planning process. Once you made the decision to hold an event, the process DID start. Don't drop the ball, and everything will go well.

BTW, personally I still would find it better for Natalie and I to stay with our youngest son in the City. If we are able to come, I expect we will stay for upwards of a week... perhaps two. I always like to visit the Hudson River collection of paintings over in Golden Gate Park. We've gone east to visit the older boy and his family a number of times since retirement, and we don't want the youngest son to think we are tilting more toward the East Coast than the West. Of course, if they'd just get married and start having grandchildren to lure us, we'd spend more time in one of my favorite cities in the world.

One thing to consider is that homeowner's associations and large apartment complexes often have a community meeting room they rent out for parties. That could be a cost-saving alternative to expensive hotel meeting rooms if someone local has access to that option.

You might be able to add a barbecue to the site and have a pot-luck picnic or two.

Speaking of picnics, there are also quite a few public and private sites often used for company picnics. Tilden Park would be a nice one.

My daughter was born in SF in 1989, and we left almost immediately thereafter. It would be good to go back -- and between now and next April I can probably shovel a bit of money together. I'm a cheapskate, tho, and would probably stay at a hostel... wherever this meeting is, please let there be some public transportation in the vicinity!

I will not be able to devote full time, because I may be impaneled this month to the Civil Grand Jury, but am willing to extend myself as much as I can to make your trip here pleasant and memorable.

I have explained from early on, very early, that I can't be there until late on the fourth. I am still interested in helping, even though I am out of the newly described area of immediate helping zone.

I think Asherman's links are useful, and I do agree that we need to figure out whether we are staying in the city or surroundings.

I plan to be there. Because of my own detailed needs, I will try to link up with the group on the days I can, if it isn't over when I get there, and may go off wading around some dunes after that.

Otherwise, I am glad to meet people between my home on the other side of the redwood curtain, or closer, in Napa, or Sonoma, etc.

osso, I posted a hotel link on page 13 of this forum. As for dates, we need to consider the 'long' weekend for folks that might have a difficult time getting off from work. Most of the respondents so far opted for the first week of April 2004, so we just sort of tied it down to April 2 through 4 with some staying for more days before and/or after those dates. Downtown San Francisco makes more sense, because there's more access to the city from the airports in the area. Once in San Francisco, public transportation is available to venture out to the 'hot spots' day or night. I'm sure many will want to ride the cable car to Fisherman's Wharf from Union Square for the restaurants, Pier 39, and Ghiradelli Square. c.i.

c.i. Don't forget Alameda on an island in SF Bay
c.i. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_2cents.gif" alt="2 Cents"/>

Everyone seems to forgotten the City of Alameda, the city in S.F. Bay, where I used to live before moving to New Mexico.

<a href="http://www.ci.alameda.ca.us/community/introducing_alameda.html">http://www.ci.alameda.ca.us/community/introducing_alameda.html</a>

I have lots of contacts there to help planning a SF gathering. Public accomodations are plentiful. And Alameda would be tons less expensive than most of the surrounding cities, with the possible exception of Oakland.

Alameda is in the center of the greater SF Bay area. It is less than 15 minutes from the Oakland Airport, which is the easiest airport to fly in and out of in the greater Bay Area. A direct freeway link from Alameda to San Francisco is a car trip of less than 1/2 hour. The Bart rapid transit trip is even less.

Lodging and rates: <a href="http://www.metrotravelguide.com/hotels_nearby/Alameda/CA/USA/0/Alameda_Museum/?&amp;radius=5">http://www.metrotravelguide.com/hotels_nearby/Alameda/CA/USA/0/Alameda_Museum/?&amp;radius=5</a>

My continuing contacts with my previous employer, one of the largest homeowners associations in the state, would make it possible to rent very inexpensively a large meeting room with a full kitchen, tables and chairs, on the beautiful Community of Harbor Bay Isle lagoon for get togethers. It is also a bird sanctuary.***

Harbor Bay Isle (where I lived) is on a second Alameda island called Bay Farm Island. There are two draw-bridges to cross to get from Oakland to Alameda. Actually, there is a third bicycle bridge. There are walking paths along the SF Bay shoreline where the San Francisco skyline seems only a few miles away. Or you can walk the paths along the meandering lagoon systems crossing the wooden bridges to get to the other side. There are grassy areas for lounging and chatting and parks and picnic areas, too. There is a unusual shopping center with several excellent, but not too expensive restaurants, a deli and an ice cream parlor. There are basketball courts and a baseball field along with several tennis courts. And, Ash, there also is a swimming pool. And for football fans, the Raiders officers and training field is less that two miles away. There also is a golf course across the road from Harbor Bay Isle near the Veteran's Park, a large, beautifully landscape park overlooking the estuary where the brown pelicans play. All of these ammenities are open to the public and won't cost you a dime.

If you are interested in Alameda as a home base for the SF Gathering, let me know and I can obtain more information for the April 2004 dates.

I'm getting homesick just telling you about my wonderful former home town. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad"/> ---BumbleBeeBoogie

***The Lagoon at Harbor Bay Isle: It's For The Birds
By BumbleBeeBoogie

From my corner office window, one can see a lovely stretch of lagoon where animal and bird life abound. Squirrels romp across fence tops and up the trunks of pine trees. Occasional opossums and raccoons make nocturnal visits under the arching Alder trees.

But its the bird life on the lagoon that never ceases to enthrall and even amuse me. One day as June was drawing to a close, I was distracted by loud noises outside. What made me look up from my work and out the window was the raucous honking and screeching of a flotilla of iridescent blue-green-feathered geese, white ducks and dark gray mudhens all frantically paddling in the same direction.

I walked out to a balcony to see what all the fuss was about. Up stream and across the lagoon, a father and daughter were seated on a dock, their dangling legs reflected in the sparkling water, throwing food to their bird audience.

Clouds of gray-white seagulls swooped through the air catching bits of food in their beaks while the geese, ducks and mudhens paddled in the water in pursuit of the bits of food floating on the water, bumping into each other and scolding furiously.

The approaching bird flotilla from down stream appeared around the bend, honking and screeching loudly to announce its arrival as if to demand "save some for me".

In the late afternoon sun dozens of tiny bird wakes spread across the lagoon as birds neared the dinner spot. Fortunately, there was enough food for the late comers to join in the feast.

I've always wondered how the birds at one end of the lagoon know that someone, out of sight several hundred yards in the other direction, is providing a feast?

However they do it, one handful of birdseed can truly draw a standing room only crowd on the beautiful lagoon.

The Bumbling Bee is an resource for this event that slipped my mind entirely. She may also want to attend as part of a trip to see her children, check on her cats and assure herself that the place didn't go completly to the dogs when she retired.

As mentioned above, Natalie and I intend being in San Francisco at least a week, and perhaps two. We had originally just planned to visit in the early Spring, but now we have April 2-4 as a touchstone to our planning.

I lived in San Francisco, briefly, in 1965. I had just gotten out of the Navy and had a real craving for the fried rice I had grown to love while overseas. I lived on - I think - Bush Street because it was so near Chinatown. I spent a lot of evenings at a place called The Coffee Gallery, because they had a terriffic folk singer there who loved Bob Dylan just as much as I. I have been on a destroyer by the San Francisco Bay Bridge a lot more often than on top of it.

c.i. I'm not sure of what you are asking to me inquire about. The only thing we could rent at Harbor Bay Isle is the meeting room with kitchen, tables, chairs, etc. I'm not sure you would want a room that big. Besides, there are so many free open space to the public facilities at HBI that there is no need to rent anything just for sitting around chatting.

If you are looking for sleeping accomodations, one of the links I provided has the major hotels, motels, and their rates. You will find most Alameda places on page 3 of the site.

Please clarify if I'm not understanding you correctly.

I am not opposed to staying in Alameda or Petaluma (etc) or intown. As we all know, I will get there late, and may just stay with friends. Or at one of those fixed up old hotels in town. But I still care where the main group stays.

I just re-read this entire thread and continue to be interested in attending.

C.I. and others are putting a lot of energy and thought into this.

Asherman makes many good points eg. using 'lessons learned' in previous meetings, the various sub-sets of prospective attendees
(like concentric circles from the local to the regional etc) and the probability of attending being related to distance from SF.

Given the different budgets and other considerations, it seems unlikely that we will all be able to stay at the same venue but that isn't necessarily a calamity. I can envision people clustering in a couple of sites -perhaps one intown with nicer ammenities and one nearby that is more suitable for budget travellers (like me).

I don't mind hanging out in your intown digs and going later to sleep in my low cost locale! :-) particularly if the 'budget travellers' all use one comparatively low-cost place. We could then travel together to link up with the main group, perhaps share a cab, have breakfast together etc.

I personally have another option ie. to stay with my brother and his wife in SF itself. (in fact I'm likely to stay there at the end of the meeting for a day or two anyway) I prefer not to stay at my bro's the whole time though since I think that it would diminish for me the feeling of group sharing. This is from a guy who went to both college and grad school while commuting from my parents home. I always felt I missed so much when I went home at night and my classmates got to stay up late in their dorms having bull sessions. :-)

PS
I am still thinking of flying in to Seattle as I did last Fall and taking Amtrak down the coast to SF. Maybe a few of the Wash/Oregon based A2k'ers could be enticed to join me in an A2K 'rapid deployment force'* to link up at the SF meeting!

* hmmm.... it DOES seem a little absurd to use the word RAPID in any context involving Amtrak!!

jjorge, With consideration to all, we're trying to provide info on many different options - locations and price - close enough to the central venue with easy transportation. 1. Oakland International Airport is probably cheaper than SFO, and less crowded. 2. Trains run from the east bay into San Francisco on a regular schedule. 3. Alameda accommodations will probably be more economical than any in San Francisco - or at the very least, better for the same or cheaper price. (I'm rather stingy on paying premium for hotel rooms, but don't mind spending above average for a good meal.) 4. Driving in San Francisco is not recommended, because parking is very expensive, and difficult to find. BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) is the train system used in the greater San Francisco bay area. BTW, how long does it take to take the train from Seattle to SF? c.i.

...how long does it take to take the train from Seattle to SF?...
</quote>

The Coast Starlight leaves Seattle at about 9am. it was supposed to get into Oakland 23 1/2 hrs later. the day I went there was a problem on the track however. A union-pacific freight train had de-railed so we were side-lined for 8+ hrs. in the mountains of Oregon. Then when we started up again we had to pull over and wait several times to let other freight trains pass us. As a result we arrived in Oakland 12 hrs late. The conductor told me that on the pacific coast run Amtrak is at the mercy of Union-Pacific which owns the track. Nevertheless it was a very pleasant scenic trip. The dining car food was more than acceptable, the company was good etc.

I learned one thing however... If I have a connection to make at the end of an Amtrak trip I would have to allow 12 hrs. leeway or I wouldn't take the chance. (even though it was Union-Pac's fault)
There were several people who missed connecting flights to Hawaii, Texas etc!

Well, I tended to pick small boutique places for about a hundred a night, less being better. One or two had meeting rooms. SF is such an idiosyncratic place, I hate to just stay at a best western myself, but I will if that is where everybody else is. Remember, I am figuring that I am arriving just as most are leaving.

But the name that I remember as verrrry interesting was the most expensive of the small hotels I looked at, around Union Square...it was the The Hotel Rex.....bookshelves in the lobby. I would forgive a lot for bookshelves in the lobby.

Ashman, Thanks for bringing this forum back to the forefront. Out of sight, out of mind. We have about 18 planning to attend - so far. Some people have provided some good links for hotels in and around San Francisco, so people will need to make their own plans on transportation and lodging. BART now has a train service from SF International Airport to the city and the general bay area. I'm still trying to locate a venue for the Gatherings.

Well, I suppose I should do what I said I would weeks ago, which is list those hotels on the list you supplied, CI, that are near Union Square and intrigue me. There are some I skipped since they seem to be in a slightly iffy spot, but I might be wrong on that. I picked for "charming" as opposed to many star amenities. And I'll re-mention one I stayed at, it was fine...

I may stay in Days Inn (etc) in Rohnert Park or Petaluma for about 40. a night, if I am driving, for one of the nights. But then I have to find a place to put the car in SF near the hotel there for a day or so. I will have to check out if I could leave the car in Larkspur and then take the ferry.... Hmm, I have a friend in Larkspur, and love a pasticceria there...

that would mean I just pack a duffle bag. You will see me perhaps in wrinkles.

Or I may fly, and take shuttle to Market Street and walk to hotel, among those on the list.

My own trip is complicated by late arrival re everybody else, and my nightblindness. So, we'll see. I'll go ahead here and list those hotels in the City that interested me a month or more ago.

I know there are more neat hotels...I have heard off and on of people renovating oldies and making them spiffy at accessible prices, and think some of those are missing on this list. But this is a fair idea of a certain type of in town lodging.

I didn't look into Ramada's etc. This is more my metier(!) no matter that I can't pronounce that. But a union square area Ramada might make good sense.

Here's the latest info on a place to meet. I couldn't find any freebies in San Francisco. When I asked one of my friends, she laughed, and said we could use Golden Gate Park for our meets. The other suggestion she made was to meet at a huge coffee shop where we order drinks, then sit around and talk. One other option is for some of us to make a 'donation' towards rental of some small hall at a hotel or nonprofit or office. I'll wait for other suggestions. c.i.

<post author="Asherman" datetime="2003-07-23T22:30:00" id="p192">
Golden Gate Park might be a good venue, if the weather cooperates and people unfamiliar with the park can find the particular corner we used. Coffee shops and bars may not be a good idea for those of us who are pretty deaf and need quiet environments if they are to hear what's going on. If we make it, I suppose we could contribute to some sort of rented venue. Hotels often have spaces that can be used by their guests to meet with small groups, perhaps that might work.

I don't understand "24", and we aren't interested in sporting events.

Well, who knows how many of us this is, at this point. It will be silly to rent a small hall if we have six in total. It if is six, maybe a lobby will be fine. Or an extra room, depending on the price.

My "24" post is in error. "Twenty Four" was the name of the restaurant that opened at 24 Willy Mays Plaza (his number, and the address of Pac Bell Park), on the first opening day.

It since has gone under, and was replaced by the Acme Chop House. I knew this, but had forgotten.

Taking an impromtu trip to San Francisco next week with the family.
Me, Hub, and two teenage sons. We're staying near Fishermans Wharf, hanging, chilling doing the tourista thing.

I'll be happy if I can get some good food. Looking for good places with great food, price no object, not touristy, but must be casual dress and atmosphere. Any kind of food is okay. Any suggestions for the total San Francisco experience?

I can't think of a better group to ask!

Fealola, this is one of my all time favorite restaurants

WHERE TO FIND THE BEST SOUFFLE RESTAURANT IN THE U.S.
By BumbleBeeBoogie

If you are ever in San Francisco, and want to enjoy the best authentic French souffle in the U.S., make a reservation at Café Jacqueline, 1454 Grant Avenue (at Union Street) in North Beach at the edge of China Town. Café Jacqueline, with its classic French country in décor, is one of my favorite restaurants.

The locally famous Café Jacqueline is a tiny store-front restaurant where entree and dessert souffles reign---the only items on the menu---accompanied by simple salads, the best French onion soup you will ever taste, and wine.

Allow sufficient time because this is not a fast-food restaurant. Each souffle is made to order. Sometimes you can chat with the chef (which I've done on a number of occasions) while her electric beaters create her lovely "runny in the middle" souffles. For example, entrée souffles may include black truffles, wild mushrooms, or just Gruyere. The dessert souffles are glorious.

Top off the evening with a concert or a play for a memorable San Francisco evening.
Make reservations by calling (415) 981-5565

I have the last four years worth of SF Chronicle surveys on best restaurants of lots of diff types, but they are at work in my Business Travel File, heh, heh.
Nag me if I forget to bring them home and post tomorrow.

Will you have a car or will you use bus and cabs?? Will try to center attention on areas that are reasonable to get to..

Give me a hint of what you might NOT be interested in, lest I go on and on in the wrong direction...

<post author="fealola" datetime="2003-08-13T22:16:00" id="p201">
We'll be using public transpo or cabs or walking. Probably a trip to Sausalito. Could use a suggestion there for lunch or dinner. Interested in anything where casual dress would be appropriate in the City. Upscalish or dive. Just good food!

Osso, I'll nag you! You're not in San Francisco are you? I don't think you are, but if you are, I'll come to your gallery!

I'd forgotten about the SF Gathering! I'm about four hours drive away and could attend... is there a date set yet?

In the next couple months it's easier, after that who knows?

PS -- I see the Amtrak train every day from my window.
I can confirm that when it comes from San Francisco (190 miles away) it's usually on time, but when it comes from Chicago (1,960 miles away) it's typically 5-14 hours late. Trains are best when you have plenty of time and no connecting deadlines.

Fealola, if you get a chance, take the ferry boat from San Francisco to Sausalito. It's been more then a decade since I've been there so don't feel comfortable recommending anything other then Scotts Seafood restaurant if it is still there. There used to be one near the ferry terminal on the Sausalito side. If not, the original one should still be down on Lombard Street in San Francisco enroute to Golden Gate Bridge.

Here's a website with some Sausalito restaurans that might help you.

You might try Hunan Homes chinese cuisine at 622 Jackson St. There's a spinoff in the south bay that I frequent, and it is some of the best chinese food I've ever tasted.

OK, I'm pretty sure the place I'm thinking of is Sam's Grill and Seafood at 374 Bush St. It has an old, worn around the edges feel, kinda sorta east coast, menu printed daily, great seafood selections in addition to the meats. Try it for lunch or dinner.

The souffle place bumblebee mentioned is good to know about too.

This is great guys. I'm taking this all in. Thank you.

I didn't respond sooner, because I was out a good part of the day and when I got home I found out about the Black Out and that my husband was stranded at JFK in NY.

He had a flight to LAX leaving somewhere around 4 and the lights went out sometime around then. Never took off. Missed it by minutes!

We've been dealing with it for the last 4 1/2 hours. He's now in a hotel near JFK. No lights. Pretty chaotic. He's on a flight tomorrow AM. (Yeah, right.) What an adventure!

Thanks for all the suggestions. He's really gonna need that mini vacation now! (Not in a good mood!) So I'm still up for San Francisco tips!

For the student/backpacker/socializing crowd, Hostelling International has 3 hostels in San Francisco ( <a href="http://www.hiayh.org/hostels/california/sf.htm">link here</a> )
Plus, I've stayed at the one at Marin Headlands ( <a href="http://63.70.211.212/cfdocs/hostels.cfm?CITY=Sausalito">link here</a> ) which is only 20 minutes north of the city, across the Golden Gate (near the beach at the Marine Mammal Rescue Center -- sad but very cool tour!). The one at Montara Lighthouse ( <a href="http://63.70.211.212/cfdocs/hostels.cfm?CITY=Montara">link here</a> ) is also incredibly scenic, 25 miles south of the city.

They have dorm lodging ($15-22) or private rooms ($45-60), but what I like most is that people from all over the world mingle in the kitchen and lounge areas. Great place to get local info, trade stories, play Scrabble and make spontaneous friends from five continents. So many languages being spoken in one place! The hostels have organized trips into the city a few nights a week, group activities and such, for anyone who happens to be around. Friendly outgoing people!

I have no affiliation with H.I., but just like 'em.
When driving, looks for the signs with the little house on it:

So do we. We've been promising to visit our youngest son for a long time, and I need to visit the Hudson River painting collection up at the Palace. We seem to be running back to the east coast on a regular basis to see the grandchildren, and we don't want the youngest son to feel that we are tilting more toward his brother. Of course, if Kris and his lady friend would fomalize their five year relationship and start having grandchildren the tables would be nicely turned. Drop the boy a hint, why don't you. He sure doesn't listen to his august parents. Oh well.

Today they tore out all the cabinetry down-stairs. We believe that the furniture refinishing has begun. Sunday someone is flying in to evaluate the damage to our Japanese woodblock prints. I believe that at least some of them might be sent to Chicago and restored. All of the undamaged books from our library are in storage, and the garage is filled to bursting with paintings, drawings, mirrors, and etc. Though the insurance will cover most of the losses and costs of restoration, we expect this thing to set us back several thousand. We are holding our breath in anticipation of a rate increase in December as a result of the flood. Oh well.

They tell us that the lower level should be completed in six to eight weeks. I'm not holding my breath. Today we got telesion cable restored to the large television, which has been moved up into the Great Room. Everything is out of order. Oh well.

Nah. Natalie is my wife of 38+ years. Born and raised in Newton, Ma. We met in a coffee house in San Francisco in 1961. She was with the Actor's Workshop and I was in a Buddhist monastry. We moved in together up on Telegraph above North Beach. No electricity, but we did have gas lights and could see Alcatraz by leaning out a window. We were among the last of the Beats and the first of the Hippies. Moved up to Haight and formed one of the first communes there. Left when the scene began to become really crazy. Lived for awhile in the same building as Erik Hoffer, and wrote a song that made the Sopwith Camel an overnight success before they fell back into obscurity. We started toward Mexico where the light was good and the living inexpensive enough that I could paint. We ended up on L.A. with a couple of sons, Shannon (career Army officer, married with two children) and Krishna (sells commercial real estate in San Francisco, and lives with his lady friend for years). Natalie worked for the Post Office to help support us while I finished my two BAs, law school and various grad schools until I got my Masters. Natalie's BA (drama) was from the University of the Pacific. Once our finances got better, Natalie did an M.S.L.S at USC. We both worked for many years in city and county government until retirement a few years ago.

Bumblebee, is an old friend that I met years ago on another internet BB. Aunt Bea was connected for many years with the labor movement, and then became one of the officials running Alameda, an exclusive and closed neighborhood located on an island in the San Francisco Bay. Bumbles retired a year ago, and influenced by my enthusiasm for Albuquerque moved over onto the west bank of the Rio Grande. She has totally rennovated what was already a fine house, and changed the landscaping considerably. She now lives with her pooch, Madison. Maddy is her baby who likes to make a nuisance of himself with visitor's shoelaces and a hyperactive need to jump and run. Beeeee's other familiar is a handyman named Henry. Henry recently was diagonsed with Nile Virus, but is well on the road to recovery. Bea remains a good and close friend, even if she is a wet-back living over with the savages on the west bank.

Does that explain the relationships.

Best in 3 Days Itinerary

Day 1

In the morning explore Fisherman's Wharf and its jumble of tourist shops, street performers, and artists. Pier 39 is a consumer extravaganza, where a double-decker Venetian Carousel shares space with touristy shops and Underwater World, a fascinating walk-through glimpse of ocean life. Don't miss the antics of the hundreds of sea lions basking in the sun. Hop on a cable car (the Powell-Hyde line is the most dramatic) at the wharf and take in sweeping views of the bay, Alcatraz, and the Golden Gate Bridge as you rattle your way to Union Square, ground zero for sophisticated shopping. The charming cafes and boutiques of Maiden Lane are worth a look. Later, head to the area south of Market Street (SoMa) to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to see works by local, European, and Mexican masters. Then take in an evening of culture on Geary Street's theater row, or quaff a cocktail and watch the sun set at one of Union Square's sky-view lounges, such as Harry Denton's Starlight Room at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel.

Day 2

Begin the day with a walk on the Golden Gate Bridge, then head to North Beach, the Italian quarter. Join locals from the old country for breakfast Italian style: an espresso and pastry at an outdoor café along Columbus Avenue. Allow an hour or two to wander this small area filled with tempting delis, bakeries, and pasta houses. You'll see such beat-era landmarks as City Lights Bookstore and reminders of the city's bawdy past in the steamy shops and clubs of Broadway. Be sure to walk up Telegraph Hill to Coit Tower. You'll be rewarded with breathtaking views of the bay andthe city's tightly stacked homes. Spend the afternoon exploring labyrinthine Chinatown, where tea and herb shops, fish markets, and exotic-produce stalls spill onto the street. Then take the California Street cable car up blue-blood Nob Hill and top off the evening with a cocktail at the Crown Room, the Fairmont Hotel's skyline bar. Or back in North Beach take in Beach Blanket Babylon, the quirky musical revue of San Francisco, at Club Fugazi.

Day 3

Take a morning ferry from Pier 41 to the infamous prison on Alcatraz Island. Or if you are drawn to the bucolic vistas across the bay, take a ferry north to Marin County's Tiburon or Sausalito for a stroll through town and lunch overlooking the bay. (Ferries to both towns depart from Fisherman's Wharf, and those to Sausalito only from the Ferry Building at the Embarcadero.) When you return to the mainland, head to the epicenter of 1960s counterculture, Haight-Ashbury, where the streets are lined with excellent music and book shops and groovy vintage-clothing stores. Join the in-line skaters, runners, and walking enthusiasts in picnic-perfect Golden Gate Park - the city's most glorious green space, with more than 1,000 acres of greenery stretching from the Haight to the Pacific. Among the gardens, lakes, and playing fields you'll find the serene Japanese Tea Garden and the California Academy of Sciences, the city's famed natural-history museum. Spend the rest of the afternoon sightseeing or strolling in the park, around Stow Lake. Don't miss the Dutch Windmill on the park's coastal edge. Head up to the Cliff House for dinner or a drink and a view of the Pacific sunset.

And also this (the website listed below has some intersting search features for lodging there):

<quote>
For the hotel industry in San Francisco, things have rarely been so bleak. But for travelers looking for a hotel bargain in a city that is often ranked in polls as America's favorite urban destination, there may never be a better time to visit.

Battered by chronic low occupancy that began with the collapse of the dot-com economy in 2000 and that continued in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks and the Iraq war, many of the city's boutique hotels now routinely offer rates of $100 a night or less for a double room, before taxes.

Several major luxury hotels around Union Square, in the heart of the city's shopping and theater districts, have offered promotional rates this summer from $110 to $125 a night for a double room, about half what many were charging in the boom years at the end of the 1990's.

''These are the lowest rates that we've seen since we went into business in 1986,'' said Eric Gustavson, a partner in Topaz Hotel Services, which runs a popular Web site ( <a href="http://www.hotelres.com">www.hotelres.com</a> ) that specializes in discount rates at major hotels in San Francisco and the Bay Area.

Examples abound on his Web site for travel this fall, including the Westin St. Francis on Union Square at $129 a night, the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf and Donatello at $109. (All these rates are for double rooms, before taxes, which add 14 percent to the bill.) The best bargain may be the King George Hotel, a newly renovated boutique hotel one block from Union Square and the Powell Street cable-car line, with rates beginning at $65 a night; the usual undiscounted rates start at $145. The newly opened Hotel Cosmo off Union Square is offering rates beginning at $85 a night this fall.

I am going to miss the main tours CI is giving, since I will get there late. Besides, I know those places, mostly, and would be along mainly to be with a2kers. Once I get there, I'll try to meet up, wherever anyone who is left is (if you follow that...). Myself, I love walking the city, just looking around.

I've never taken the ferry, I might get into that. It lets off in Larkspur, I think, and I know an absolutely wonderful italian bakery/caffe there (Emporio Rulli).

On my own, I'd probably check out some art. And food, SF has incredible restaurants. Food and talking, that is my idea of getting together. Hmm, can't remember which day the street market down by the embarcadero is...but it's pretty neat, in a neat area.

PDiddie, the Conservatory of Flowers sounds like heaven to me. Like Osso, we prefer to do lots of talking in comfortable surroundings, so we probably won't be going to very many arranged tours.

The ferry to Sausalito sounds lovely. I lived in SF for a couple of years in the 60's and always loved puttering around in Tiburon and Sausalito.

Golden Gate Park is a must--just hope for good weather. Coming from Tucson, AZ, the coldest winter I ever spent was during a San Francisco summer. Hopefully April will glow with sunshine.

What about the Embarcadero, c.i? Is it worth a trip?

When you enter at street level, you won't see "lobby". You have to go up to the second floor. It's pretty incredible. This pic doesn't do it justice, it's a 19 story indoor open air atrium.

For the Corazon Gathering we planned a host of outside activities. There were multiple short to day-long things for attendees to do if they wanted. Trips to nearby reservations, Madrid (a local Arts Community), and to places like Santa Fe/Taos were available. Nature walks ranging from very easy to moderately difficult along the Rio Grande and into the foothills of the Sandias were mapped out. Locally we had tours of museums, the Old Town Plaza, art galleries, and shopping ranging from inexpensive to pricey. We compiled a list of restaurants, and went and "test drove" the ones we weren't familiar with. There was even horse-back riding, if anyone wanted.

Without leaving Corazon, guests could swim or lounge around the pool. We had Scrabble, Trivial Pursuits, jig-saw puzzles, Dominoes, cards &amp; poker chips, Checkers and Chess available.

What did the participants end up doing, you might well ask.

They sat on our patio drinking iced tea, eating chips and dip, smoking and mostly talking. Dys and Di did drive one afternoon to the top of the Sandias, but the weather that day wasn't clement. Talk is what folks wanted to do, and they did it from early each morning until late each evening. We thought of trying to format at least one evenings discussion, but the group really preferred unstructured conversation that ranged from obscure quotations from long-dead thinkers to what their cat's favorite toy once was. The Corazon group tended to shy away from public restaurants because so many of us are to some degree deaf. Bars, nightclubs, saloons and casinos didn't seem to tempt any of our guests as far as I know. Though some of our members are sensitive about having their pictures taken, that didn't seem to matter in the relaxed atmosphere.

The San Francisco gathering has a ton of wonderful things to do, after all the Bay Area is rich in attractions. Participants will almost certainly end up at a variety of hotels and accommodations. No "in-house" dinners, drinks and snacks are likely, so eating and drinking "out" will be probably be the norm. Not having a central location where everyone can "flop" for up to 16 hours is a handicap, if the participants desires and expectations of what the Gathering should be are the same as we experienced. Folks want to talk and have extended interchanges with internet friends. I believe people want the chance for their acquaintances to deepen into a warmer friendship. It takes a bit of shared time to appreciate how deep, or I suppose how shallow, our companions might be. I think we look forward to sharing some experiences, like a trip to &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;, but mostly we want to talk and hear how our site correspondents think and "fit into" a more "normal" conversation.

I hope that some sort of hospitality suite can be arranged where the group as a whole can regard as "home", and where extended conversation is possible.

<post author="cicerone imposter" datetime="2003-10-17T10:16:00" id="p282">
Ashman, You make a good point about a "home base." I've asked around about "free" venues in San Francisco, and they all laughed at me. The next q is whether people are willing to "donate" into a fund to rent a place - say 10 percent (only a suggestion) of what you're already spending for lodging. We can find a 'central' location in the downtown area that will accommodate most of our participants. Just a thought.

The link provided by PDiddie is excellent. Here it is again if any of you missed it:

<a href="http://www.hotelres.com">www.hotelres.com</a>

The prices have really gone down! A few examples:

Chancellor, 433 Powell St., at the foot of Nob Hill, $79-99, $20 nght offsite parking.

York, 940SutterSt., lovely picture, built in 1925, $79-89, $16 self-parking

Ramada Plaza, 1231 Market, Civic Center, $89.95, $20 parking.

King George, 334 Mason, 1 blk Union Sq. and Powell cable car, $75-115, $21 Parking.

The Nob Hill Motor Inn, 1630 Pacific Ave., $74-124, free parking.

Now I need those familiar with SF to tell me if you know anything about the particular hotels.

I called the number given on the link and was told that many of the hotels don't take reservations this far in advance.

Diane, I am posting in a hurry but many of the hotels you mentioned on PDiddie's link were also on mine, which I think was also around page nineteen, or maybe I just looked and looked and wrote up a list. What I do remember is that a bunch of the hotels I looked at did have pictures...

I made reservations at the Rex for February 12, because we're going to see The Lion King at the Orpheum, and I don't want to drive home at night. It'll also give us a chance to have dinner in the city, and make it a whole day affair. We're paying $150 (plus tax comes to about $175) for the Rex, but they have free parking, so it's worth the extra few dollars, since parking is very expensive. The $129 price listed by Diane is a decent price for the Rex.

Turner, I know about the financial part. Still, some of these hotel rates are better than they have been in years. Hope you can make it.

Osso and c.i., maybe both of you can look at the lists and tell us which of them are in decent locations--particularly the Nob Hill Motor Inn at 1630 Pacific Ave. The price, $74-$124, with free parking, is almost too good to be true.

Nah, that's not the problem. My sister lives in Fremont (East Bay), and I got family that lives out there, so I could crash at their place.

It's the taking time off of work and flying out there. Sure, there are cheap airfares, but it would be 7 tickets, as my wife and kids would come along as well... Unless I convince her to divorce me between now and then...

Thanks for the offer, JD. I appreciate it.

Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it out. Maybe next summer...

Ah, Bezerkley... my dad used to work as a contractor at UC. Long long time ago...

I really must stop reading this thread... it's making me homesick! <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad"/>

Ah, well, nothing I haven't felt for the past five years.

I'm trying to remember what else is out there, it's been a while. Chinatown used to be good to eat, but my mom said they had a problem when SARS was big earlier this year. I don't know if they've recovered from that yet, but some of the best chinese food I've ever eaten was in San Francisco.

Ah, that reminds me of the street vendors with the hot dogs on Market Street. Those were always good. I used to love Market Street at lunchtime... all the people. So many people, doing so many things... makes my mind wonder, it does.

I think we used to eat at No 9 Grotto when I was a kid. Really nice resturant, actually it sits over the bay on Fisherman's Wharf. I also remember it being pretty expensive. And the Bay Tours were pretty cool too. Red &amp; White and Blue &amp; Gold. I always liked the Blue &amp; Gold better, myself.

Oh, and there's an aquarium in Peir 39, where you actually go under the tank, and the fish swim around you. *That* was always pretty cool. And they had the 'petting' zoo on one of the levels, the kids got to hold starfish and stuff like that, pet baby sharks. Talk about power... those sharks are nuthin' but muscle. A definate see, if you can. I don't recall what the pricing is, but I'll see if I can dig up a weblink to it.

edit:

Okay, It's called <a href="http://www.aquariumofthebay.com/">Aquarium Of The Bay</a>, and it looks like it's $12.95 for adults, $6.95 for kids. We enjoyed it, even tho it was a bit more than we wanted to spend.

There's also <a href="http://www.pier39.com">Pier 39</a>. There's a lot of links for touristy stuff to do there. Pier 39 is also next door to Fisherman's Wharf, so you can park at one and go to the other, if you're driving. The Chili &amp; Chowder Sourdough bowls I was talking about can be found at <a href="http://www.boudinbakery.com/">Boudin Bakery</a>. And San Francisco Sourdough is unlike any other sourdough I know. I heard once what makes it different, but I don't recall now.

Turner, Fisherman's Wharf doesn't change all that much, so a revisit will make you feel right at home. (Gotta increase the temptattion.) SARS was only a scare, and not a reality. All is back to 'normal' in Chinatown.

Turner, I live in Silicon Valley, and we have several shopping malls that are exclusively Chinese. Their parking lots are always packed during lunch hours, because they have about a dozen or more Chinese restaurants, and we have Hewlett Packard and several other high tech companies (goes without saying, heh?) in the neighborhood. My wife loves to go shopping at their supermarket, but I refuse to go, because the parking is so bad.

Yeah.... I remember when they first put the Red Lion there out by Dixon Landing Road in Milpitas. Last year (early 2002) we were out there and I was amazed at how it grew! Didn't like driving through it either... the smells were too distracting. I almost had to stop at every restaurant! As I recall, that whole strip was Oriental too. Isn't that Sun Micro out that way?

I tried and failed to post just the map, but this whole article is interesting anyway.

Now I'm going back and look up some hotels, see what attracts me this week. I think I liked some on both my and pdiddie's lists.

Need to find where Diane's mentioned hotel is.. (Parking the car is particularly attractive...)

Also, I want to see if there are any Days Inns, etc. in Novato, for example.
close across the golden gate.

I can stay myself at some friends places, e.g., in Larkspur (Marin County) or Kensington (near Berkeley) and have another friend moving to the city soon. But I'd rather be with at least some a2kers if I can swing it.

Anyway, back later after I noodle around some more. First I will try to find and link pdiddie's and my old hotel lists...

Have been meandering for an hour or more now on ci's Hotels.com site, the one where I found about 7 hotels I liked well enough before. Had trouble finding the prices this time around and have been looking, somehow, at TripAdvisor, and found more...ay yi yi.

But, I stopped in the middle to post this little honey... right by Fort Mason park (Green's restaurant, good shops, jogging, dog walking), which is right along the bay. (see picture on a2k gallery of osso and pacco under Pets). The description says that the NYTimes called it the best value for the money. It intrigues me because of the very SF style - 65 - 95/nt.

Found another one on Pacific perhaps near the one Diane mentioned, where car parking is free, called the Nob Hill Motor Inn, $69 - 199.

Also saw an expedia thing (or one of those, for the St. Francis at 119. That's one of those places we could take over the lobby or the grill room or one of the bars.. or the breakfast room... if some people stayed there.

More time meandering around on Hotel.com, this time off of google.com.

I am split seconds away from signing up for Hotel Savoy, at 89.95 a night. Parking is extra, but I might not be taking a car, and it is real close to an airport shuttle stop.

Tap, tap, tap.....

OK, I did it. 89.95/a night, which of course is more with city taxes, for three days it comes to $314. I seems to be, according to the map a few posts back, just into the tenderloin area, but it isn't far from Union Square, I think it will be fine.

I only mention all this for other people, as I am an old inhabitant of gang territory and am not particularly chary of any place I've driven through many times near Union Square in SF.

Actually, I think it is just up from the John Pence art gallery and is in a perfectly fine area.

Anyone else interested, check Savoy Hotel, Hotels.com.....

the Nob Hill is 4 blocks from Geary. Working on the other co-ordinates. Expedia can get me a not bad deal on a flight and 4 nights in a deluxe room at the Nob Hill (about $100 less than for 4 nights in a standard room in the Savoy - gotta look into the neighbourhoods a bit further).

If no one wants to splurge and stay at the Ritz, you might consider eating there instead. The Dining Room at the Ritz Carlton (as it is known) is one of the best places to eat in the city. Of course it's not cheap.

This place and Gary Danko are currently the two top tables in town. An hour or so drive to the north will take you to The French Laundry in Yountville, which is probably the best restaurant in the U.S., but you have to know how to get reservations (months in advance), and you have to be able to find the place (it has no sign).

Wow, cjhsa, the restaurants sound loverly, but too expensive. If I win the lottery, dinner is on me at either of those restaurants.

I contacted the Nob Hill Hotel because they weren't showing up when I put in the April dates. Their site states that parking is $20.00 a day. I guess free parking is not to be found--at least in decent hotels.

I've been a fly on the wall on this topic now and again. I love San Francisco. Hubby will be there on business and I'm going along for the ride, but that's not 'til next October.

I've been wondering, I know that some of you have already met on other occasions and have had a great time together. Have you thought of renting a house or a condo and splitting the cost between a few of you?

VRBO (link below) has a number of weekly rentals, anywhere from a studio, sleeping 2 to a 7-bedroom, sleeping 12. The group would have a place to get together.

I've rented vacation homes a number of times from owners who advertise on VRBO, as well as Cyberrentals, and my experiences have been very positive.

CI, I have been on this thread from the very beginning, literally, and have always been arriving the fourth. My room at the Savoy is (within reason, and perhaps past that, open as a meeting room. In fact, if we make my room a place to meet, then if I happen to need surcease I can go to various of friends' places, including the friend I just mentioned who just moved to the Marina area.

I am perplexed about whether to invite her to join us.
I would rather she know you all from discussion, and will
see if she will engage here.

In the meantime I prefer to stay at the Savoy. Geez, I have a mixed (trust me) and desultory and sometimes exciting set of memories in SF, and will get a kick out of staying right near Union Square.

And to reaffirm, CI, doesn't my room look like a central place???

This idea may be superceded but is comfortable for me.

Anyone remember my meandering about eating breakfast at the St. Francis?

I had a car breakdown in... the really dreaded summer of 2001, at 19th and Ocean, in SF. I left the #### car at the gas station (there aren't any Volvo dealers nearer than the Moon) for the weekend and took a taxi in the dark (adventure for me, I am nightblind) to the Galleria Park Hotel, which a friend did the elevators of (friend's husband = engineer = elevator company), so I remembered the name for the taxi driver. The good news was I had the money in my wallet to pay the fare, unusual in itself, just because I was on a Trip.

Whiled away the weekend walking downtown. Bought one thing, a pair of light pink satin chinese slippers.

Ate breakfast at the St. Francis. Swear it was under ten dollars and I was among the five people in the room. Totally comfortable.

mmmmmm, not far from the Savoy. or similar places.

osso, It would be great if somebody else stays at the Savoy during our gathering dates. A central location would make it convenient for the participants, and people will have the freedom to go in-and-out at will. Any volunteers out there? **Please invite your girlfriend.

Hooray!!! Dys and I found a small (96 rooms) hotel for only $79.00 a night with parking for $16.00--the York Hotel, 940 Sutter St.
It has a coffee maker in the room, so we don't have to spend a fortune on breakfast.

Here is a description:

<quote>
European Style Hotel built in 1925 is rich with History. Bright sun lit Lobby in a pale terra-cotta hue. Corinthian Columns and Marbled floor. In addition to the hotel's superb location, guests enjoy all the amenities of home. Spacious and elegant accommodations, thoughtful amenities and a friendly staff to serve your every need.

Nice to hear all the updates on reservations; I'm really getting excited now. I talked to my brother-in-law yesterday about staying over at his place, and he said "okay." Things are really building up for our A2K San Francisco Gathering. I hope more people chime in about their dates and reservations. I'm going to start making up a 'hard' list of people that's going to attend, and perhaps develop a simple "program" of events with some background on our attendees. How about it?

Fealola,
It is not all so weird meeting friends from a forum like this online, in my experience. I met Piffka and Seattlefriend and PeaceandLove when I went through Seattle (on purpose, to see them, plus I had never been to Seattle, but that was waaay second) on my way to and from my aunt's memorial
service in Idaho a year and a half ago. And then this last June, I went via Seattle when I went to NY city to see the museums (for the first time in decades) and visited P and SF again (they could still stand the sight of me) and in NY, met with Diane and Roberta and a few other online friends. These people are now very dear to me, and I liked them to start with.

I want to go back to New York. There are people at a2k who live in/near there that I like a lot and missed meeting, plus I want to see my pals again, plus, I want to spend more time in New York. (Send money to...)

You might think I have no friends in real life... hah, not so.
But I am if anything more secure with my online friends, that they can take whatever I might say and talk right back to me... a certain comfort level. Meeting is a little strange, you know them but you don't. But that passes.

I think your sons might get a kick out of your meeting us.

Yaaay, Pdiddie.

I'm not afraid or weirded out, but when you have kids that were raised in the Instant Messenger and Internet culture, all they've heard all their live is be careful! But I'm cool with it in this case. I think I can figure out a way if it comes to that.

I think it would be a lot of fun!

The only time I've metioned it was when I got a recipe idea from Cav which Mr. F. loved! I told Mr. F. that I found a place where you can communicate with a real chef and get ideas!

I need to get some feedback on whether I can excuse myself from the San Francisco Gathering in early April. Here's what happened. We had a 49 day memorial service at our home for my mother-in-law who passed away last month. The minister came from Sacramento to perform the service. He informed us today that he is taking a small group on a trip to Japan for 12 days beginning on March 25. My wife asked if he still had space for others to join his trip, and he said "yes." This is an opportunity to travel with somebody that lived in Japan and speaks excellent English. He will be our guide. I will also need to get an excuse from Grand Jury service, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel in a small group with a Buddhist priest. The group will also visit Himeji Castle, where my mother-in-law's grandfather served under the shogun, and their family crest is in that castle which my wife wants to see. How about it? Will you excuse me? c.i.

Oh, gosh. I haven't looked at this thread for a while. April in SF would be a treat! My daughter was born there but we moved up here to Seattle three months later... It would be really cool to go back for a visit, especially to meet the people I've been thinking of as friends for so long.

I'm currently unemployed, tho, so coming depends on getting a job soon (I'm hopeful) and saving enough for travel/lodging/etc... It sounds like a good goal!

PDid, I'm really feeling bad about all this, but I've been promising my wife a trip to Japan for many years, and told her we would make the trip when she retired at the end of 2004. But this opportunity popped up out of nowhere, and it's really something I've been planning for my wife for many years, because she enjoyed our trip to Japan so much since our first visit in 1982. Your post made me feel a little better, but I'd like to hear from more A2Kers planning to come to San Francisco. I've heard from several people that were planning to attend, but will not, because of other plans. pueo will not be coming, because he's having a family get-together in Hawaii, and he's one guy I've always wanted to meet. Even promised him a dinner, but that wasn't enough. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"/> The good news is, Saddam has been captured.

It might be a good idea to put out a call for all who definitely plan to attend to post that intention, c.i.

Your graciousness in asking our permission not to attend is not lost on me. Please don't think that any here are so selfish in our desire to meet you that we would ask you not to take your wife to Japan.

For my part, I hope someone else onsite (or close) can step into the semi-coordinator role you staked out for this Gathering; it always helps if there is someone to assume responsibility for things like contact at arrival, preparing an activity roster and other minor logistics.

I'm sure this will be a wonderful trip for your wife and yourself; and we will, likewise, have a great Gathering and anticipate meeting you at the next one.

Of course we understand, CI. I myself regret a trip I didn't take to Japan with a small group and a teacher from Japan who is now a good friend - that was a lifetime opportunity I couldn't afford at the time. A quarter century later I now wish I'd put it on a Visa.

On coordinating, PDiddie, why don't those of us who are going to be there for sure keep in contact? I am not getting there til sometime on the fourth (have made hotel but not plane reservation yet).

CI, can you tell us more about who you know isn't coming? It would make figuring out the For Sures, the I Hope So's, the Can'ts a little easier.

PDiddie, do you have plane reservations already? Diane has made a hotel reservation I think but might be able to change it, and so could I.

Only made a hotel reservation at this point, so if the date moves around I could probably shift a bit, but would need to coordinate with Ms. PDiddie's vaction schedule, which may or may not have flexibility, depending on her co-workers' vacation schedule.

After April 7 works for me. In fact I would prefer it if it means that you'll be there.

As a practical matter it probably shouldn't be immediately after your return as you'll need at least a little time to recoup from your japan trip.

Maybe the SF gathering could be in the latter half of April.

I'm at the tenderloin edge, and so are/were diane and dys and pdiddie, sort of tenderloin adjacent according to the Chronicle map. I like the St. Francis as everybody knows, neat lobby or used to be, and I wonder about some other local places, like the Sir Francis Drake or even the Raddison to just meet. I mentioned my hotel earlier and that's still a possibility but I have no idea right now if that makes sense.

Well, we can pick something when it all gets closer. The Hyatt is a walk but not all that far... she says confidently. (Diane and I walked Forever in New York City.) and the Embarcadero is an area people probably want to see.
How shall I put this, I don't mind walking long on the flats but am a complete wimp on the hills.

Oh, I thought of another restaurant. We'd have to have cars though** - depends on where people are going.. Greens in Fort Mason. <a href="http://greensrest.citysearch.com">http://greensrest.citysearch.com</a> It's in the marina area, right by a long concrete waterfront where people walk dogs by the water and the golden gate bridge is in view. (see a2k Member pictures p3 for osso and pacco on bench there). Greens is a vegetarian restaurant in congenial surroundings w/glass front to the "dining room" and the restaurant ia accompanied by some shops nearby as well. There's a Green's cookbook out. It wasn't horribly expensive but not nothing - I am remembering $10. for my lunch dish, and wasn't the best food I've ever had, but I liked the surroundings. Aaaack. There are hundreds of places to meet and eat in SF.

We'll have to figure out if people will want to do some things together - maybe people will want to split up and meet for pre-dinner/dinner. CI has already suggested some tours. And I want to write up a possible list of places people might be interested in.

I probably want to go to some art galleries, but I may stay longer than others and do that on another day.

On food and drinks, what a selection SF has. Some people like to drink beer and others tea and others wine or booze, and some will want to eat this and that. Some of us can't hear if it's noisy and like to walk a lot and others might not.

Cjhsa has already mentioned some cafes on this thread and I know some.

Ah, and then there was a good place I've been to just to have a morning dolce in North Beach. Lots of tables, good pastry.. (ahem).
Long walk though.

** - I see there is a bus, #28, but from where? Maps, maps, we need maps.

Making a note of the window of opportunity. I'm keeping an eagle eye out for the holiday and vacation schedules at work. I'm going to try to nab it as soon as I can. I have to check with my 'buddy', to make sure he has nothing planned around then.

Oh, yayyyyy, and hoping.

Also, my friend who was up here on Dec. 26th to bring one of my paintings and have dinner w/me said, when I told her about this and that Cav might come, well, tell him I'll get the supplies and provide the kitchen if he'd cook a dinner...

I didn't inquire much further, as we were mid meal at the 301 and it is a little hard for me to hear in there (hi, diane!!). I presume that would be for her and her husband's friends at their house, which is presently in mid renovation. (but - she is managing it and she has credentials in construction management, and besides, the kitchen is not being renovated just yet, still a fifties type kitchen). These are the people I gave knives (serious forged knives) to for their wedding a year and a half ago).
It might be amusing for Cav. Further inquiries pending. I didn't explore re some of us who weren't elsewhere coming, or whether Cav has a fee, it was just a leaping thought. But Lynn can make things happen. Alternately, they may be in Turkey in April, so this is ephemeral.

Anyway, I who lives at the other end of the financial range, if not the edge, am going to look in the next couple of days at the Savoy and Nob Hill Motor Inn, one more time. I still think I am flying vs driving...

Good, CI. Personally, i just hope to meet and hear about your trip. Will your wife come meet with us? I am probably not coming on the tours myself, but it depends, maybe I'd love to catch a ferry with friends... Lynn tells me that the early market around the embarcadero, which she took me to and where we had breakfast before when we spent two days going around galleries, has moved into a building and is bigger and better, will have to find out the particulars. When you line up who wants to tour and the rest of us, maybe we can meet at the launch or somewhere on the way.

Osso, you were right when you mentioned that there were two hotels named Nob Hill. The Nob Hill Moter Inn does have free parking, which makes it MUCH cheaper for Dys and I.
The early market at the Embarcadero sounds wonderful--I also want to find that museum some friends and I went to when we lived there in the 60's. The memories were 'enhanced,' making it harder to pinpoint the location. The fog, the statues seeming to move as the fog wisped around them--ah, magic.

I think the only painting we ever bought in San Francisco is a small oil by Sumner. I think we paid $200 for it several life time ago. On a visit to the Hawaiian islands one summer, we visited a art gallery that had Sumner paintings, so I asked the lady how much a similar sized painting was priced. She said $2,000.

<post author="ossobuco" datetime="2004-01-01T19:42:00" id="p430">
Hmm, maybe if you took the train, I could drive to Redding and catch it... (it doesn't go through Eureka). Course then you'd not see Eureka, unless we rented a car for a one way trip. I'd invite all to my house, but there aren't that many beds. But there are lots of motels.

I'm still thinking of flying - I'd better check on ticket prices. They rise and fall quite horribly. But I don't drive my Volvo big distances anymore, after a horrendo trip to LA a few years ago, a five time breakdown trip with at least three or was it four visits to mechanic - one Chevron, three Volvo dealer - involving giant sums of money and stress. So I have to consider the cost of car rental when I look at flight prices. Plus time consideration. Plus me' eyes, hard to predict where'll I'll be with that, re driving, as my left one should be all better and my right one worse by April (cataracts have to be a certain thickness before they do the operation, and the right one isn't bad enough right now.) It might be fine, as that eye's regular vision isn't as bad as the left's alway has been, and one keeps changing prescriptions to keep up with the eye change until the cataract gets thick enough (watch dollars fly out window).

Also, way back earlier in the thread, Ehbeth mentioned - or was it you, Piffka, possibly getting a mixed flight and room deal (at the Savoy?).

Complicating things, I am going to try fit in seeing some nona2k friends while I'm there (hoping I can get them to come to my hotel, maybe even meet some a2kers.)

Hmm, I think I'll go on a little hotel and ticket hunt. Will report back!

Wy, SF is pretty good on public transportation. Besides, parking is too darn expensive in the city if you can find it. Forget it during commute hours.

Osso does still plan to come to SF then - it's been in doubt lately so I hadn't posted until I decided to "go for it".
That friend I mentioned - who knows if she will be busy that week, we'll see. I had been planning to stay some extra days to see different people, and now I have a work project to check out in Napa Valley so I probably won't stay extra in SF. So personally I might prefer to see a2kers only, rather than try to arrange friends in the area meeting too... too distracting.

Now that my vision is normalizing, I still hope to do at least a little gallery looking and would love to have company.

JJorge has said several times he'll be there.
Mikey seemed to think he would too.

I don't know about Dys and Diane. I do very much hope they'll go for it too.
Fealola had mentioned she might try to come up, possibly deciding at the last minute.

I hope to figure out where I'm staying in the next day or two. Maybe I'll try to stay where pdiddies are booked.. or where I'm already booked (but for the wrong weekend), or where dys and diane have picked, if they are still going. Plus whether I'm driving or flying. Stay tuned...
Anyway, back on that in the next few days.

Yes, she got Bill into trouble with her putting down "cookie baking housewives" and then atoned for it by becoming "cookie baking Hillary" That phase lasted a few months as I recall. She dropped Rodham to show that she was willing to play the "good wife" after she became widely seen as out of control, too independent a person to be a good First lady.

M Obama needs to show that she is willing to play the "good wife" by shutting her mouth, just has Bill has recently decided to do the same thing. You know Bill hates it, M would as well I am sure, but they do it for their mates, because being elected president is important to their mates.

Hillary did it to herself. She did not know about what her husband was doing because she did not want to know, there is no other plausible explanation for how an otherwise intelligent woman can be so ignorant for so long. The sympathy that Hillary gets for Bill screwing around on her is misplaced. It shows a lack of good judgement on her part, which should be a negative quality in a person who wants to be POTUS.

If so then Barack picked poorly, for that would make her an unsuitable wife for a politician. Politics is a game with rules, if the wife is not willing to play those rules then that candidate needs to either get a new wife or play a different game.

That's absurd! Laura Bush is the wife you probably speak of, and look

With Eleanor, so far as I know (not having studied her much), her husband's political needs come before her desire to do good work and run her mouth in public. She did have a way of pushing hard enough that her husband's staff became unhappy with her though. Eleanor and her husband had a private deal though, and her wants/needs for a public life never were allowed to get much in the way of his much more important public life.

Please refer to the comments about personal life not being the same as public life. Controlling a spouse in the campaign for public office says nothing about how the person maintains their private life, or their views on gender or use of power in personal relationships. It does say something about the spouses willingness or unwillingness to be supportive, as well as the candidates ability to be persuasive. You don't suppose that Hillary took a whip to Bill do you?? No, she most likely convinced him that he was hurting her, and that he needed to knock it off. If Barack can't convince his wife to do the right thing how is he going to convince other world leaders of anything, especially after Bush has done all of the damage he has done??

McCain will have a feast on Barack by way of his wife if he does not wise up soon. Barack is a great politician, but he has a blind spot when it comes to his wife. This is forgivable, but he must adjust.

Just WHO is asking her to tone it down and what makes you think your opinion is right? If nobody has asked her to tone it down, why do you accuse her of "not even doing that for her husband"???

Maybe she thinks she IS helping him - what do you know of her reasoning and their relationship anyway?

How do you defend your statement that she's putting him at risk? Maybe he ASKED her to be "extremely outspoken"?

That would be the parts that tend to come off as her putting Barack down or in his place, as well as the impulse to speak her mind fully on everything. If she does not have some idea of how the words she is about to put into the public space will help Barack fulfill his mission then she should not be putting them out there. This run for president is primarily about him and his mission, not about her, and she does not seem to understand that.

She seems to take calls for her to tone down as calls for her to be a submissive wife, when it is not at all. I am sure that some of the women who have been quietly supportive of their husbands in their public life have been exactly the opposite in the private life that is their marriage. She and Barack can do what ever they want in their marriage, no body cares unless problems in their marriage cause problems outside of the marriage as is has for the Clinton's or unless it shows a lack of character on the part of the candidate as it did for say Giuliani.

I don't think she hurts Barack in the primary, after all the other spouse is Bill and he has been even more mouthy. She will against McCain though, and everything that she is saying now can be used against barack by McCain.

Face it, you can't deal with the fact that there could be occasions in life, even in 2008, where a woman keeping her views to herself and supporting her man would be the right thing to do. Neither can Michelle, so maybe this is a wider problem that needs to be explored.

I insist that I am right because i believe that I am right and no one has presented any evidence that I am wrong. Emotional reactions to my point of view are not only irrelevant but those who suffer from the affliction also suffer from clouded judgement because their emotion gets in the way of perceiving reality.

The challenge on the table is to argue how I can be a misogynist if the same rules apply to bill. Nobody has made any argument, all you have to offer is emotion, personal attack, and trying to hound me into silence. In other words nobody has offered anything. I believe this is because you have no counter to my argument because I am right.

If you don't think I am right then kindly grow up, and present an argument that makes some sense.

I am never into male bashing, hawkeye. Male chauvinists on the other hand,
will receive what they have coming to them, and it seems, I am not the
only one who has the same opinion of you. Almost everyone is opposing
your point of views and your way of thinking, hawkeye. Doesn't that
make you stop and re-think that you might be wrong if the majority of
people are telling you so?

I don't think it has anything at all to do with anything Michelle said. I think his point is that Bill spoke his mind and got his head handed to him. He's asking why the rule isn't the same for Michelle. Unfortunately, he's going about the asking in an awkward way that puts everyone immediately on the defensive rather than willing to discuss the issue.

My answer would be that in most cases cited in that article, Michelle is talking about herself and/or her relationship with her husband, while Bill was talking outside himself and his relationship to Hillary and was denigrating Obama. I'll admit I only skimmed the article so there could be more substance to it than I noticed. For the most part it was just a bunch of rehashed quotes and soundbites obtained from other articles mashed together to construct a strawman.

Go back to the original piece, it was about how Michelle refuses to tone down her personality. Overall it is not the words it is the tone and message behind the words. SOme have taken offense because they assume that I am apposed to strong women, after all so far as Michelle is concerend all she is doing is being herself, which is a strong woman. I have argued that this race is about her husband not her, that her role is to support him, that she does not have a good political radar, and thus she needs to tone it down. SHe needs to put as much of herself into the public space that she needs to to accomplish the goal of helping him, but no more.

What as Calamity and the rest in a tizzy is that they can't get their minds around the reality that some times (in 2008-oh my!) the roll of the wife is to to support and assist the husband, full stop. This should not be such a difficult concept... sometimes the wife helps the husband get what he wants, sometimes the husband helps the wife get what she wants. That's marriage, you know, teamwork.

Please don't play all innocent here. Let's rehash what you said:

<quote>
Michelle seriously needs to wise up. Her job is to be supportive and help her husband can get elected and do good work, what she thinks about anything is irrelevant, and being mouthy makes her husband look bad.
</quote>

<quote>
M Obama needs to show that she is willing to play the "good wife" by shutting her mouth...
</quote>

<quote>
If so then Barack picked poorly, for that would make her an unsuitable wife for a politician. Politics is a game with rules, if the wife is not willing to play those rules then that candidate needs to either get a new wife or play a different game.
</quote>

<quote>
....her husband's political needs come before her desire to do good work and run her mouth in public.....
</quote>

<quote>
The fact that he never had a chance does not alter the reality that his wife hurt him, and that his inability or unwillingness to control her hurt him.
</quote>

<quote>
If Barack can't convince his wife to do the right thing how is he going to convince other world leaders of anything, especially after Bush has done all of the damage he has done??
</quote>

<quote>
ut if she continues to put her desire to speak out ahead of her husbands mission she will hurt him much more than she helps. It strikes me a selfishness.
</quote>

<quote>
Barack is the candidate, Michelle is not. Her role is to support him, period.
</quote>

<quote>
I also agree that a good dose of Michelle serves to humanize Barack....she can be very good for him if she stays in her lane.

No, a few people have had an emotional reaction. I do pay attention to emotional reaction, but I am holding out for you to move beyond emotion and to support your point of view.

I have been alive for 46 years, you act like I have been in a cave for most of it and have no clue. At some point you are going to need to question that assumption, for not only do I have a very firm understanding of who I am, I also have a wide range of experience in life and have a well thought out and a well felt out perspective on what my experience in this world has shown me to be true.

It might be that this year will prove my wrong, it might me that the point does not matter because Hillary is the candidate not him. I am arguing a position, which people have said that they disagree with, but which no one has made any case against. So I stick to my position.

Yes, Michelle is Barack's wife, and as his wife, she has a role to play in the Nomination campaign. I'm sure they discussed it before and during the campaign to date, and in fact, have likely been advised by their strategists who likely pore over media reports and opinion polls.

According to you, however, you are naively contending that Michelle is so self-absorbed that she is willing to risk her husband's political future by doing and saying whatever she wants, ignoring polls, media and politico's opinions, her husband and his strategists. Now, sit and think for a moment. Is that what you are truly suggesting? If so, what is your proof?

A cheerleader for male bashing? How so? How does bashing one sexist pig (you) constitute being a cheerleader for male bashing? No. Sorry. It doesn't. My position that you are wrong and that men have no right to superimpose their will over that of their wives is indicative of a belief that men and women are completely equal in respect to their inherent right to their own self determination. Only a sexist pig could interpret such a position as taking something away from men let alone cheerleading for male bashing. That you are unable or unwilling to recognize the inherent flaw in your own position is a product of your own shortcoming. Hawkeye bashing is a simple matter of calling a spade a spade. Real men don't think like you do, so Hawkeye-bashing most certainly doesn't constitute male bashing.

In a meeting with the press earlier today on his campaign plane, Barack Obama spoke to about the snapshot of the race, today:

...

 Q: Is there one defining moment that brought this campaign to where it is right now?

OBAMA: It was when Michelle started campaigning more actively. That turned it all around.

Here's another argument against your assertion:

<quote>
As the clock ticks toward Election Day in Ohio and Texas, BARACK OBAMA takes time out of his hectic schedule to talk to our JANN CARL about the people who keep him grounded during this crucial time in his life.

"If I ever get puffed up, she punctures me, knocks me down a peg," he says of his wife MICHELLE. "[She] asks me about stuff I was supposed to do around the house that hasn't gotten done. And my girls do that. Because whether I've had a good day or a bad day, if I'm talking to them and they tell me something exciting about a field trip they took or a play they're in, it reminds me of what's important."

Barack says that his 9-year-old is a chatterbox while the 6-year-old is a comedian. "They're better than TV," he says of his girls. "You just sit there and they can just amuse you all day long. And they're still at that age where they actually think you know what you're talking about. I'm sure that will fade very soon!"

He says so far his daughters have been pretty well protected from the spotlight, but have learned that him running for president takes some adjusting. So he and Michelle have made a deal with them. "After the campaign -- win or lose -- they will get a dog," he says. "Sometimes I worry that they're rooting for me to lose so that they can get their dog quicker!"

With a former First Lady making a highly credible effort to reoccupy the White House, and, this time, the Oval Office as well, it makes sense for American voters to take a good look at the wives of the current male candidates. If Hillary is any example, voting her husband into the office will be providing Michelle with "the experience" she may (with profound irony) rely upon when she makes her own run for the presidency.

This is but one reason to take seriously her public comments and published opinions.

Another, is that spouses are, in one way or the other, a reflection of each other.

If someone's spouse enjoys setting fire to stray cats, public expressions of love, and support would, correctly, reflect that person's attitude about torturing animals.

Before some of our more hysterical posters fly off the handle, obviously Michelle is not someone who enjoys setting fire to stray cats. I am using exaggeration to make a point.

Of course one's reaction to her words and deeds are essentially one's opinion expressed. So what? One's vote for a candidate is one's opinion expressed.

That's what candidates count on, and none more than Obama.

It is ridiculous to suggest that someone's take on Michelle Obama's comments are immaterial because they are merely an expression of opinion.

It seems clear that Obama loves and respects his wife -- good for him. It also seems clear that he is hoping that his being married to her will help people form a favorable opinion of him.(It's naïve to think that Michelle has not in some way factored into Obama's strategy for running against a woman).To the extent that it works he succeeds; to the extent that it doesn't, it's at best disingenuous to cry foul. (Which, to his credit, he, unlike his supporters, doesn't seem to be doing --- but them maybe he's counting on his supporters to scream in protest.

It's hard to imagine that many people will not vote for Obama because a belief that he can't "control" his wife, simply because there is nothing at all to suggest that he is trying to do so. Instead it is much more reasonable for people to craft their opinion, in part, on what she is saying and doing since it seems clear that if he doesn't endorse it, he at least is OK with it.

She, and her comments, are not off limits.

BTW---It's hardly a truly feminist position to insult John McCain's wife because she chooses not to insert her opinions into the public debate or because she is attractive and younger than her husband. When you self-professed feminists what to decry hypocrisy, look to yourselves.

The same garbage was thrown out here about Fred Thompson's wife. Anyone who took the time to check Mrs Thompson out beyond her looks and cleavage would have found she is an intelligent, educated and articulate individual That she happens to be "hot" makes Thompson all the more lucky.

It is laughably ironic when a so-called feminist choses to judge a sister simply by her looks.

No, because I have agreed that michelle can help him, and have not said that she has not. I also have said that Michelle being so outspoken will not hurt him against Hillary because Bill has been even worse. It is also true that Hillary can not throw Michelle under the bus because you women like to stick together and there would be an emotional response against Hillary if the did that to Michelle. I have said that McCain will use everything Michelle is now saying against Obama, which will come later. His own wife putting him down and publicly running over his personality with her own when so many already question if Obama has the balls to do the job of President will come in very handy for McCain. Michells words will reinforce a perception of Obama as weak that is already fairly strong.

Read all of the stuff that has come out in the last few days about Obama being willing or not to go balls to wall with Hillary now that she has demanded it. Almost everyone agrees that if he will not do it he will lose, and there is no clear sign that he is willing and able to do it. Hillary has challenged Obama's manhood, and he needs to step up. What Barack is getting from Hillary is nothing compared to what he will get from McCain.

I want Obama to win, he does not belong to just Michelle, my hopes and dreams for our nation for the moment ride with Barack. If she screws this campaign up I am going to be pissed, and it will not matter to me what Barack agreed to or why he did.

I am suggesting that the tone of her mom's comments are correct, that Michelle will not stay quiet for anyone for any reason. It is a character flaw. Yes, it is self absorption, though there is zero chance that she sees it that way.

With a former First Lady making a highly credible effort to reoccupy the White House, and, this time, the Oval Office as well, it makes sense for American voters to take a good look at the wives of the current male candidates.

So we should judge every spouse of a politician as if she was running for office. That is downright stupid to even suggest such a thing. Spouses aren't running for the office.

This is but one reason to take seriously her public comments and published opinions.

Another, is that spouses are, in one way or the other, a reflection of each other.

If someone's spouse enjoys setting fire to stray cats, public expressions of love, and support would, correctly, reflect that person's attitude about torturing animals.

Before some of our more hysterical posters fly off the handle, obviously Michelle is not someone who enjoys setting fire to stray cats. I am using exaggeration to make a point.

No need to go hysterical about the exaggeration. The concept is silly. Yes, husband and wife may share some ideas but that doesn't mean they do. To use another silly exaggeration. If a man likes sleeping with women does that mean his wife also likes doing that? Public expressions of love and support really show nothing about attitude for personal foibles of one's spouse. No one is perfect and loving someone doesn't mean you love everything they do.

Finn,
I didn't notice anyone complaining that Michelle was criticized for being outspoken. I certainly have no issue with that. Like many, however, I do disagree with the criticism. For that matter; I see nothing unreasonable about Hawkeye's belief that political spouses should tow the line, though I find it more than a bit presumptuous and frankly naïve (as he subsequently admitted; he can't know anything). Neither Obama nor his staff need agree with everything she says for her to be an asset. IMHO, she is a very likeable figure in her candor and if I were advising Barack; I wouldn't advise his asking her to limit her discourse to canned PR friendly phoniness. It is only my opinion, of course, but I think a sincere 95% PR friendly Michelle is far more valuable than a Stepford wife would be unless she has some ingenious ability to present a manufactured self as genuine, without losing a lick of her candid charm. That's a pretty tall order for most people (Bill Clinton being a notable exception).

I haven't heard her say anything ill-advised enough to offset the positives (by my reckoning) she brings to the table. People will all, of course, judge her differently, but that goes without say.

 Q: Is there one defining moment that brought this campaign to where it is right now?

OBAMA: It was when Michelle started campaigning more actively. That turned it all around.

That enough of an argument against the case you are making against Michelle's tone? Is it enough for you that he is okay with and thankful for it?
</quote>

No, because I have agreed that michelle can help him, and have not said that she has not. I also have said that Michelle being so outspoken will not hurt him against Hillary because Bill has been even worse. It is also true that Hillary can not throw Michelle under the bus because you women like to stick together and there would be an emotional response against Hillary if the did that to Michelle. I have said that McCain will use everything Michelle is now saying against Obama, which will come later. His own wife putting him down and publicly running over his personality with her own when so many already question if Obama has the balls to do the job of President will come in very handy for McCain. Michells words will reinforce a perception of Obama as weak that is already fairly strong.

Read all of the stuff that has come out in the last few days about Obama being willing or not to go balls to wall with Hillary now that she has demanded it. Almost everyone agrees that if he will not do it he will lose, and there is no clear sign that he is willing and able to do it. Hillary has challenged Obama's manhood, and he needs to step up. What Barack is getting from Hillary is nothing compared to what he will get from McCain.

I want Obama to win, he does not belong to just Michelle, my hopes and dreams for our nation for the moment ride with Barack. If she screws this campaign up I am going to be pissed, and it will not matter to me what Barack agreed to or why he did.

Publicly running over his personality with her own? When was that?

I think the "failure to secure the bread" comment may be at the heart of this.

I agree a political spouse should watch out about going wading in a pond at two in the morning, nekkid or semi, drunk, alone or with another... (that's a oblique reference for some oldies). A political spouse contradicting policy points? of course they may, but preferably not on Sunday morning news. Talking about failure to secure the bread from going stale? That's fondness talking.

What is downright stupid is to take what I have written and turn it into a declaration that we should judge every spouse of a politician as if she was running for office.

We have seen in the past dynastic families in American politics. Up until now they have tended to involve the male lines of a family, and certainly this has been the case with the presidency. Hillary Clinton in this election has set a precedent that we can expect to be repeated.

It makes sense to consider the spouses of candidates if they demonstrate any potential for seeking elected office, in one's estimation of the candidate. It also makes sense to consider any other family member with actual or potential political aspirations.

As has been demonstrated time and time again, the election of one member of a family opens the door for the election of other members - including spouses. As a result it has always made sense to consider the possibility that electing one member of a family might pave the way for the political career of others. By no means should it be the only consideration, nor even one of the most important, but despite the fact that almost no one actually thinks about, I would argue they should.

Only now do we see an example of a spouse using a stay in the White House to springboard her political career. Do you really think she will be the only one that does?

It seems pretty clear that Laura Bush loves and supports (both privately and publicly) her husband George, and yet if she believed of him what you and so many others in this forum think of his character one would have to question her own character if not her sanity.

I suppose there are a few people who think they can be a normal person and still love a monster, but it is clear that, in such cases, their understanding of normality and/or love is warped.

If you believe that Michelle's public pronouncements and personal positions are not only reasonable but accurate, then you are probably going to see his marriage to her as positive rather than even neutral. If you think they are merely foibles, then you are not likely to allow them to influence your opinion of him, however if you find them troubling and/or objectionable, it makes sense for them to influence your opinion of him.

Clearly, you are not of the third group which is of course fine. You may be able to make a good case why her pronouncements and position should not be troubling or objectionable (although I doubt you will change anyone opinion on this), but it is something altogether different to suggest that someone who does find them problematic should not consider this as a factor in their estimation of him.

There is every reason to believe that Michelle Obama will be a trusted and influential advisor to a President Obama. I have no problem with this and even if I did it would make no difference, but while she may not end up another Edith Wilson serving a Regency, her beliefs and opinions will have a not so inconsequential impact on this country.

The very recognition and consideration Obama gives to his wife's intelligence and abilities which most of his supporters find endearing is reason to concern ourselves with the nature of the influence she will have upon him.

On the premise we are arguing -

What is it? That this man running for office needs to control this wife who is running her mouth off?

I didn't notice proof of that, or, never mind proof, cause for that he needs to.

Is Hawkeye using Collin's mildly wondering sentences as his point of view?

That he is the one who is running? Yes, there is no question of that, and so?

And that is a perfectly reasonable position. After all, you support the man for the presidency, and the people who judge his wife differently than you, probably do not.

In the case of Mr and Mrs Obama it is unlikely that there will be many who find her pronouncements and positions troubling, but are A-OK with his. Similarly, it is unlikely that anyone who disagrees with Mr Obama's proposed policies and stated opinions are going to be A-OK with hers.

But it does matter what she says. You and others may not have had a problem with her stated lack of pride in America, but others did, and if they did, it makes perfect sense for them to impute that problem to him.

Personally, I find his association with a church led by someone with the opinions and beliefs of Rev Jeremiah Wright to be a little troubling, but I think he has made it clear where he diverges from those opinions and beliefs. I'm not sure I understand how he is able to compartmentalize and separate the embraced notions of his spiritual leader from the offensive ones, but it's his faith.

Can we expect him to similarly approach the things his wife says and believes? I seriously doubt it, and not so much because he is incapable of doing so (after all its his marriage too), but because politically he never could.

Simple:

You figure Michelle has "some" influence on his "refining" of his take on things.

(Wow, now that is a truly dramatic endorsement of the significance of Michelle's role in their relationship!)

But, you figure that is in the realm of "presentation."

(Forget substance, she is only able to influence him on whether or not he puts his hands in his pockets, or chews gum while on the stump)

He has advisors up the kazoo (should be wazoo, but that's another thread) so why would anyone think that his wife might be one?

(Wow again. Even the advisors dangling off of his kazoo (wazoo) are of more importance than the insignificant Michelle. Why would he need his wife as an advisor, he has them up the "kazoo?")

If he had a relationship where he thought Michelle approximated an equal partner, it might be a worry.

(Wow, yet again! No need to worry about Michelle's nuttiness because Barrack has made it crystal clear she's around for sex and raising the kids)

Osso - You, generally, make fair sense, but take another look at what you wrote. If it's an accurate reflection of your belief then I'm either more of a feminist than you or I have a much higher opinion of marriages.

There are only two ways a spouse of a candidate deserves to be judged:
a) the candidate on his/her choice of a spouse (relates to making good choices)

b) the spouse on his/her ability/willingness to be supportive of the candidate should they win

Opinions, beliefs and policy positions of the spouse are in every other respect irrelevant.

Apparently, common English now accepts "kazoo" as "the buttocks or anus" and so your usage was academically acceptible.

On the other hand, "wazoo" has no accepted definition other than "the buttocks or anus."

So corruption of a perfectly defined term can lead to accepted usage, but no pride should be taken in its employment.

There is no need for a third choice. "Kazoo" is ambiguous; "wazoo" is not.

If it has not already arrived, at some point I expect the corrupted use of "literally" to be accepted by Websters. At that point you may feel ratified by asserting that Obama has numerous advisors, literally, up his kazoo.

After losing Texas, Ohio, Rhode Island and his mojo, and getting whipsawed around by Hillary and his own chuckleheaded coterie of advisers, he will now have to come to grips with something he has always skittered away from: You can't be elected president unless you prove you're tough.

Hillary's undeniably tough, as even admiring conservatives admit. The Wall Street Journal op-ed page dubbed her Ma Barker, saying she had tapped into the angst of blue-collar women who know they have to ignore their "moping" men and "suck it up and hold the house together."

Ma Clinton knows where Obambi's soft spots are; she knows he likes being petted on his pedestal, that he's unnerved by her, and that he can never fully accept how shameless she is. What could be more shameless than suggesting to Democrats that John McCain would make a better commander in chief than Obama?

The Obama campaign seems naïve when it keeps reacting with hurt feelings and play-by-the-rules protestations to the Clinton modus vivendi of grabbing the slightest slip and ripping it open. Hillary's kneecapper Howard Wolfson compares the goo-goo Obama campaign to Ken Starr with a straight face.

The superdelegates are watching to see if Obama can stiffen his backbone. After seeing their candidates lose races they should have won in 2000 and 2004 because they flinched at Republican political waterboarding, Democrats do not want to watch the bully swipe their lollipop a third time.

Apparently, common English now accepts "kazoo" as "the buttocks or anus" and so your usage was academically acceptible.

On the other hand, "wazoo" has no accepted definition other than "the buttocks or anus."

So corruption of a perfectly defined term can lead to accepted usage, but no pride should be taken in its employment.

There is no need for a third choice. "Kazoo" is ambiguous; "wazoo" is not.

If it has not already arrived, at some point I expect the corrupted use of "literally" to be accepted by Websters. At that point you may feel ratified by asserting that Obama has numerous advisors, literally, up his kazoo.

I figure Michelle Obama has some influence on Barack Obama's refining of his takes on things, but I expect that is in the realm of presentation. He has advisors up the kazoo. He and she are not the same person, and I'd be very surprised if he is not clear on that.

I'll acknowledge that can be a worry with some couples, but I don't see it going on.

FINN
Simple:

You figure Michelle has "some" influence on his "refining" of his take on things.

(Wow, now that is a truly dramatic endorsement of the significance of Michelle's role in their relationship!)

But, you figure that is in the realm of "presentation."

(Forget substance, she is only able to influence him on whether or not he puts his hands in his pockets, or chews gum while on the stump)

He has advisors up the kazoo (should be wazoo, but that's another thread) so why would anyone think that his wife might be one?

(Wow again. Even the advisors dangling off of his kazoo (wazoo) are of more importance than the insignificant Michelle. Why would he need his wife as an advisor, he has them up the "kazoo?")

If he had a relationship where he thought Michelle approximated an equal partner, it might be a worry.

(Wow, yet again! No need to worry about Michelle's nuttiness because Barrack has made it crystal clear she's around for sex and raising the kids)

Osso - You, generally, make fair sense, but take another look at what you wrote. If it's an accurate reflection of your belief then I'm either more of a feminist than you or I have a much higher opinion of marriages.

in reply -

Well, we probably do have a different idea of what equal partners means.
I grant each person in a marriage - or in a conversation between friends over coffee or in a conversation between people who don't know each other in a forum - their own mental autonomy. I'm not particularly interested in getting others to change their minds on anything, and wasn't with my husband either. I think I only did that once in something like 25 years, and that wasn't about politics. We did often think alike on a lot of issues. We did express opinions zillions of times. I remember no tones of 'advising' the other person in some kind of instructional way, from either of us... more an expression of our own developing thoughts.

That is how I try to be at a2k too, though of course I flub up; there are posts in my cumulative awk history (er, that's more word play) that I'd be glad to take back My interest is my own curiosity, my working out of what I think.

Whether the Michelle and Barack Obama marriage is anything like mine, re "advice giving", I've naturally no idea. What I read is that he is interested in her help on how the presentations are going. Perhaps I missed more information than that.

Yes, I think a spouse could have a deleterious effect on a partner who is in some office because of pushing some agenda. Oh, astrology, for example, re decision making. I think it is useful to know the extent of the spousal "expertise" and its influence.

At present, I'm not worried by what I read of Michelle Obama.

With a former First Lady making a highly credible effort to reoccupy the White House, and, this time, the Oval Office as well, it makes sense for American voters to take a good look at the wives of the current male candidates. If Hillary is any example, voting her husband into the office will be providing Michelle with "the experience" she may (with profound irony) rely upon when she makes her own run for the presidency.

This is but one reason to take seriously her public comments and published opinions.

Another, is that spouses are, in one way or the other, a reflection of each other.

If someone's spouse enjoys setting fire to stray cats, public expressions of love, and support would, correctly, reflect that person's attitude about torturing animals.

Before some of our more hysterical posters fly off the handle, obviously Michelle is not someone who enjoys setting fire to stray cats. I am using exaggeration to make a point.

Of course one's reaction to her words and deeds are essentially one's opinion expressed. So what? One's vote for a candidate is one's opinion expressed.

That's what candidates count on, and none more than Obama.

It is ridiculous to suggest that someone's take on Michelle Obama's comments are immaterial because they are merely an expression of opinion.

It seems clear that Obama loves and respects his wife -- good for him. It also seems clear that he is hoping that his being married to her will help people form a favorable opinion of him.(It's naïve to think that Michelle has not in some way factored into Obama's strategy for running against a woman).To the extent that it works he succeeds; to the extent that it doesn't, it's at best disingenuous to cry foul. (Which, to his credit, he, unlike his supporters, doesn't seem to be doing --- but them maybe he's counting on his supporters to scream in protest.

It's hard to imagine that many people will not vote for Obama because a belief that he can't "control" his wife, simply because there is nothing at all to suggest that he is trying to do so. Instead it is much more reasonable for people to craft their opinion, in part, on what she is saying and doing since it seems clear that if he doesn't endorse it, he at least is OK with it.

She, and her comments, are not off limits.

BTW---It's hardly a truly feminist position to insult John McCain's wife because she chooses not to insert her opinions into the public debate or because she is attractive and younger than her husband. When you self-professed feminists what to decry hypocrisy, look to yourselves.

The same garbage was thrown out here about Fred Thompson's wife. Anyone who took the time to check Mrs Thompson out beyond her looks and cleavage would have found she is an intelligent, educated and articulate individual That she happens to be "hot" makes Thompson all the more lucky.

It is laughably ironic when a so-called feminist choses to judge a sister simply by her looks.

A lot of us choose mates who are in many ways opposite ourselves, though we must of course share some core values. So, you cant tell very much about Barack from looking at his wife. I care that he picked a interesting, smart, and caring person for his wife and that tells me something about Barack, but that is as far as that goes.

Sure, the wife will counsel the president, so will countless others. The person we elect will be responsible for what he/she chooses to do while in office, not those who they take advise from. If you don't trust the person you are looking at to make good choices while in office, if you think that you need to evaluate what their spouse will advise, if you think he will take the advise of his wife over the advise of all of the professionals in the field that he has available on any given subject, then keep looking. This candidate is not the one for you.

At one point we looked at spouses to see if we thought that would do a good job of carrying out the duties of First Lady, but the First Ladies now do pretty much what ever they want to do, or not much of anything at all, and most people don't care anymore. I am sure Laura Bush has a staff and does something with her time, but I have never heard of any of it being consequential

Then perhaps you should educate yourself? Laura Bush has been very active in many different circles of importance.

She helped organize "Helping America's Youth". She has been an advocate for women's health issues and is the ambassador for "The Heart Truth" campaign. Not to mention her work in Breast Cancer awareness. She has also been helping the women of Afghanistan. Not sure what all is going on there, but she's helping them to get the education that has been denied them for years and years. She's heavy into making sure our children have accessible to them, books that might inspire their life. She has traveled a lot to the Gulf Coast to check on the rebuilding after Katrina. I don't believe any of that has been for "show". I believe her heart is genuine. Women and children have benefited greatly by having her as the First Lady..... as well as others.

I think those are all consequential. She is very low profile, by nature, though. Perhaps that is why you think she has done nothing significant. ( Or could it be that a lot of her stuff has been geared towards women, and that makes it inconsequential to you?) Just wondering.

She's done a lot of good things as first lady IMO.

She has been low profile in large part because the Bush's hate entertaining and doing the social stuff that Presidents usually do. I have no doubt that Laura Bush is a fine person with good intents, and it might be that I don't pay enough attention to what she does to know that she does worthwhile things with her time. However, I suspect that 7+ years into an administration if the First Lady was making any difference that someone somewhere would be singing her praises. I don't hear any of that in the public space.

Obama's Wife, Clinton To Campaign In Pittsburgh

POSTED: 1:21 pm EDT April 1, 2008
UPDATED: 1:53 pm EDT April 1, 2008

PITTSBURGH -- The two Democratic contenders are criss-crossing the state in hopes of winning your vote, with both campaigns holding events in Pittsburgh on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, the candidates concentrated on the eastern part of the state. Sen. Barack Obama stopped in Wilkes-Barre and then Scranton.

Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton started in Philadelphia. She then also stopped in Wilkes-Barre and will head to Erie for an event Tuesday night that's creating some controversy.

The Roman Catholic Bishop of Erie said he will boycott Mercyhurst College's graduation in May in protest over Clinton's visit to the campus.

In a written statement on Monday, Bishop Donald Trautman said he was disappointed in the Catholic school for not reflecting the Roman Catholic Church's stance on abortion. Clinton favors abortion rights.

Trautman said he notified Mercyhurst of his decision and is open to meeting with school President Tom Gamble to determine how to better ascertain the school's Catholic identity.

Meanwhile, Clinton will be back in Pittsburgh on Wednesday for an economic summit at the IBEW Conference Center at 11 a.m. The event is not open to the public.

Obama's wife will make her first visit to Pittsburgh on Wednesday. Michelle Obama and Teresa Heinz-Kerry will host a Stand for Change Rally at Carnegie Mellon University's Skibo Gymnasium at 2:15 p.m.

W.W.J.K.: Who Would Jesus Kill?

W.W.J.K.: Who Would Jesus Kill? [/u]
Ann Coulter
March 11, 2004

William Safire, the New York Times' in-house "conservative" - who endorsed Bill Clinton in 1992, like so many conservatives - was sure Mel Gibson's movie "The Passion of the Christ" would incite anti-Semitic violence. Thus far, the pogroms have failed to materialize.

With all the subtlety of a Mack truck, Safire called Gibson's movie a version of "the medieval 'passion play,' preserved in pre-Hitler Germany at Oberammergau, a source of the hatred of all Jews as 'Christ killers.'" (Certainly every Aryan Nation skinhead murderer I've ever met was also a devoted theater buff and "passion play" aficionado.)

The "passion play" has been put on in Germany since at least 1633. I guess 1633 would be "pre-Hitler." In addition, Moses walked the Earth "pre-Hitler." The wheel was invented "pre-Hitler." People ate soup "pre-Hitler." Referring to the passion play as "pre-Hitler" is a slightly fancier version of every adolescent's favorite argument: You're like Hitler!

Despite repeated suggestions from liberals - including the in-house "conservative" and Clinton-supporter at the Times - Hitler is not what happens when you gin up Christians. Like Timothy McVeigh, the Columbine killers and the editorial board of the New York Times, Hitler detested Christians.

Indeed, Hitler denounced Christianity as an "invention of the Jew" and vowed that the "organized lie (of Christianity) must be smashed" so that the state would "remain the absolute master." Interestingly, this was the approach of all the great mass murderers of the last century - all of whom were atheists: Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot.

In the United States, more than 30 million babies have been killed by abortion since Roe v. Wade, vs. seven abortion providers killed. Yeah - keep your eye on those Christians!

But according to liberals, it's Christianity that causes murder. (And don't get them started on Zionism.) Like their Muslim friends still harping about the Crusades, liberals won't "move on" from the Spanish Inquisition. In the entire 350 years of the Spanish Inquisition, about 30,000 people were killed. That's an average of less than 100 a year. Stalin knocked off that many kulaks before breakfast.

But Safire argues that viewers of "The Passion" will see the Jewish mob and think: "Who was responsible for this cruel humiliation? What villain deserves to be punished?"

Let's see: It was a Roman who ordered Christ's execution, and Romans who did all the flaying, taunting and crucifying. Perhaps Safire is indulging in his own negative stereotyping about Jews by assuming they simply viewed Romans as "the help."

But again I ask: Does anyone at the Times have the vaguest notion what Christianity is? (Besides people who go around putting up nativity scenes that have to be taken down by court order?) The religion that toppled the Roman Empire - anyone?

Jesus' suffering and death is not a Hatfields-and-McCoys story demanding retaliation. The gist of the religion that transformed the world is: God's only son came to Earth to take the punishment we deserved.

If the Jews had somehow managed to block Jesus' crucifixion and He had died in old age of natural causes, there would be no salvation through Christ and no Christianity. Whatever possible responses there may be to that story, this is not one of them: Damn those Jews for being a part of God's plan to save my eternal soul!

Gibson didn't insert Jews into the story for some Machiavellian, racist reason. Christ was a Jew crucified by Romans at the request of other Jews in Jerusalem. I suppose if Gibson had moved the story to suburban Cleveland and portrayed Republican logging executives crucifying Christ, the left would calm down. But it simply didn't happen that way.

Of course, the original text is no excuse in Hollywood. The villains of Tom Clancy's book "The Sum of All Fears" were recently transformed from Muslim terrorists to neo-Nazis for the movie version. You wouldn't want to upset the little darlings. They might do something rash like slaughter 3,000 innocent American civilians in a single day. The only religion that can be constantly defamed and insulted is the one liberals pretend to be terrified of.

"Safire called Gibson's movie a version of "the medieval 'passion play,' preserved in pre-Hitler Germany at Oberammergau, a source of the hatred of all Jews as 'Christ killers.'"

This is nonsense. Gibson used the SCriptures themselves, and if you have ever read it, it is quite specific in all the gory details. Human nature here at work is the central message combined to what Jesus was saying. It doesn't point at any one group, it points at all of them.

"But according to liberals, it's Christianity that causes murder. "

Yet another gross generalization from the poison pen queen. You do realize any argument attached to a gross generalization is totally invalidated, don't you?

"In the entire 350 years of the Spanish Inquisition, about 30,000 people were killed. That's an average of less than 100 a year. Stalin knocked off that many kulaks before breakfast. "

This is callous, devaluing human life, and laughing at human suffering. It isn't even accurate. The Inquisition didn't stand alone with killing Europeans in the Middle Ages. Their ignorance about the fleas on rats living in the filth that caused the Black Death is a good example, and a third of Europe was wiped out. God was the reason there as much as He was for the Inquisition.

"But again I ask: Does anyone at the Times have the vaguest notion what Christianity is? "

Anne sure as hell doesn't. Her lack of compassion here is appalling.

"The religion that toppled the Roman Empire - anyone? "

More nonsense. Converting to Christianity allowed the Roman Empire to survive a few centuries more than it would have. Rome was in power for 1,200 years. Christianity took over during the last three centuries or so. It was a corrupt Senate that led to a corrupt empire, and of course, the German hoardes invading them while they wallowed in their corruption.

"Jesus' suffering and death is not a Hatfields-and-McCoys story demanding retaliation. The gist of the religion that transformed the world is: God's only son came to Earth to take the punishment we deserved. "

This is downright sick. Jesus came back to complete the laws of Moses, and to demonstrate that man's inhumanity against man is the root of all his sorrows. Please note Jesus was preaching tolerance, acceptance and forgiveness, and not the least of which, love having more authority than power. Anne resembles a Satan-worshipper more than she does a Christian. Jesus let them torture him to death to demonstrate acceptance and what it really means. Satan was not happy about this at all.

"Damn those Jews for being a part of God's plan to save my eternal soul!"

Man, talk about not getting it. Jesus was telling us we have to save ourselves. God gave us free will. We can act like the Romans, or grow up and start cooperating with each other. It holds true to this very day.

"The only religion that can be constantly defamed and insulted is the one liberals pretend to be terrified of. "

Someone constantly defaming and insulting people is terrified here, but it isn't the liberals.

This article comes perilously close to being slanderous. But that is what to be expected from neocons, especially when their throne is in jeopardy.

The irony here is that Anne is so willing to heave molehills in front of mountains and call them condo complexes, that she exhibits the very liberalness of interpretation and slanting she so thoroughly despises and denounces. I don't think even a physician has the power to heal her blackened husk of a heart. I doubt even Jesus could.

Coulter is making up this burroshit as she goes along--in the 350 years of the Inquisition, about 5000 people were executed. Her flippant remark about the "Kulaks" (a manufactured term of Stalin's) is typical of her glib insensitivity--literally millions of Russians and Ukranians died, but she would have us believe that this somehow justifies the slaughter christians have perpetrated. I notices she mentions the Inquisition (and displays her ignorance), but fails to mention the tens of thousands of people, mostly women, who were burned as "witches" by Protestants. Dime to a dollar she's Protestant herself, wanna bet on it? Charlemagne spent nearly 40 years slaughtering Saxons because they were not christians, and in one year alone his chroniclers brag that more than 5000 women and children were slain in a single incursion. The Knights of the Tuetonic Order used to hunt down Letts and other peoples of the Baltic as though they were wild animals, and they claimed to be doing God's work, because these Slavs were "pagans." During the Reconquista, the soldiers of Aragon and Castile were left free to plunder any captured city, and slaughter anyone who stood in their way, because they were Muslim, or simply because they lived in a formerly Muslim-controlled city (often, the majority of the population were christians and Jews). After the "Moors" were driven from Spain (the few survivors who were not slaughtered outright), Our Dear Isabella decreed that Jews could convert to christianity, get out of Spain, or be executed. Letting the "Tercios" plunder a city was convenient, also, because then the Queen didn't have to pay them. Her successor, Carlos, who became the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, used the same tactic in northern Italy, where the population simply happened to be in the way. As late as a century later, the Tercios were let loose in Antwerp, and because some (and by no means all) of the population were Protestant, they were given a week to murder, rape and plunder. Once again, this obviated paying them. The wars of the Reformation saw Catholic against Lutheran, and Lutheran against Calvinist, and everybody against the Anabaptists (who were accused of communal living and group sex, as well as principles of free love--the Baptists ? ! ? ! ?... puh-leeze). In France a crusade was carried out against the Albigensians, claimed to be heretics, as well as the Waldensians, who were hunted all over Europe. The Hussites might have been snuffed out, as was their inspiration, Jan Hus, had they not developed fire arms to a high degree, and taken to the road in wagon trains, which they would circle to fight off the Austrians when they were attacked.

I've left out pages of examples--christianity is one of the most blood soaked religions the world has known. That's not "liberal" propaganda, it's something called history. Every time Our Dear Annie opens her mouth, if you can understand her despite having both feet firmly lodged there, you get yet another breath-taking display of her ignorance. I no more consider the murderous excesses of the christians to be evidence of the basic moral corruption of the contemporary christian than i consider the fairy tales embodied in the New Testament to be evidence that the Jews are "Christ Killers." Coulter is an embarrassment to the journalistic profession; but, as Mencken observed, no one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.

Craven, please.

"All humans were born in the solar system". A non-fallacious generalization that is true is NOT a gross generalization that lumps a myriad of conditions into one group and definition.

Since Earth is part of the solar system, the NF version is OK, and arguments can be made to support it.

But to say all liberals are anything is sheer nonsense. We may look like sheep, but there is a wide range of divergent opinions coming out of the liberals. You need look no further than your relatives to see this. To try and attach a logical argument to something that is patently false does not a case make. If the foundation of your house is faulty, your house will fall down, not last for 100 years.

By the way, I am not a liberal. Seriously. I'm not a democrat either. I'll go for a democrat's throat when he says something stupid. At this time, however, it is the republicans that are wallowing in stupidity, hell, downright deceptive maneuvering.

Thank you, Setanta -- I'd like to be shown the text in the scriptures describing in detail the scourging. You won't find it. You also won't find Mary present with towels to wipe up the blood given to her by Mrs. Pilate. Gibson has underestimated the taste of the American public and the sound of money changing in the temple is echoing across the country. He and Newmarket didn't expect the film to do more than 40M the first weekend. The question is who instigated the controversy? Who tends to gain from the controversy?

Yes, to say "all liberals are X" is probably going to involve fallacy. Not always as you generalize fallaciously.

But in an irony you invoked a fallacious generalization about generalizations. Then proceed to use another fallacious generalization.

False. Again you use a fallacious generalization (about generalizations).

Watch: "All liberals are within the solar system."

Look, I agree with you in that Ann's generalizations are fallacious, but intelligently contructed arguments are not her cup of tea.

That doesn't mean yours are not fallacies. You are just stacking one on top of the other.

As an aside, my earlier example was fallacious. No, not all humans were born in the solar system.

Me calling a gross generalization a gross generalization is not a gross generalization.

All I am saying is that one cannot use logic to form an accurate argument around a gross generalization like Coulter does.

Craven is splitting hairs to be irritating, and humourous, I suppose.

OK, I see you make use of semantics here.

To say that all liberals think X is most likely a fallacious and gross generalization of the real situation that exists. To take such a position and then to make arguments concerning it is most likely stating falsehood and illogic

Setanta, that reminds me (and I don't mind digressing any thread regarding Anne Coulter), next time you're in town, check out People's Bar and Eatery at Spadina and Dupont. Fantastic diner food, huge portions, great value. Had a souvlaki there last night, and this giant plate arrives with a grilled pita, garnish that would have counted as a full salad course, heaps of tzaziki, and a generous portion of nicely charred pork. Expecting a sandwich, I also ordered fries and gravy, which I swear was big enough for four. I went with my dad, he got a chili burger with fries and a beer, I had soda water, and the bill was just $23 and change.

Anyway, back to Annie. I wonder what she thought of Schindler's List? I also wonder what Mel's dad thought of it?

The scriptures do in fact detail the torture. They speak of 80 lashes, or was it 40? Anyway, when you actually show someone getting lashed 40 times, it's quite horrific. We are somewhat removed from this horror nowadays, but the ancient world understood it perfectly. The horror of the torture of Christ is included in the Scriptures, but they don't display it out in all its gore. But if you pay attention to every single last detail offered, and turn it into full-length images, you get what Gibson created.

The Bible would offend all kinds of people if every last detail was put into accurate imagery. Sex, lust, greed, adultery, gluttony, bestiality, all of the dark side of human nature is crammed into it. The words alone don't make it totally obvious, but when you turn them into accurate images based on the words, you get rated R and then some. Hell, revelation alone terrified me when I was a little kid reading the Bible when no one was prompting me to do so. Hell, I used to know a guy that crashed in life, and then read the Bible obsessively cover to cover without let up, then he killed himself. I'm not sure why, but it's an unusal response, don't you think?

Jesus could have fled the Garden of Gethsamane to avoid what came afterwards. He knew they were coming for him. But he didn't, and submitted to the tortures they inflicted on him to demonstrate that key Christian tenet of sacrificing yourself to save others. It doesn't have much to do with the Jews at all beyond their abandonment of him once Caiaphas starting strutting around. Pilate didn't want to kill Jesus, but the rabblerousers insisted on it. If anyone is to blame, it is Caiaphas, but one Jew does not a people make.

"Some are unfortunately not born innocent but sociopathic."

True enough, but you need to qualify it a little, don't you think?

The enviroment influences, but the individual determines.

Of course, some are born just out-and-out defective, period, but in that, they are still innocent. They had no say about showing up as a monster or physically defective in some way that leads to great evil.

And like I said, what happens after that is complicated, and based on the actions of a great many people, usually. If my family had its way with me, I would now be a really nasty criminal with a really bad attitude for what I suffered through. Sure, the influence was great, but I determined something else for myself, and sought the help I needed to avoid falling into the pit of darkness.

Sure I have my scars, but I am not a sociopath - at least I don't think I am....

Pretty close D', the actual reason is that even those of us on the right can only deal with Ann in small doses. Those of us who love her, understand that you can never tell what will set her off and in which direction she will attack.

I wasn't saying it was cav, only that it is supposed to.

I used to listen to Howard Stern back in the early '80s when he was on 66AM NBC in New York and was listening the day they canceled his show. Although I am not the Stern fan I once was, I do find some of his antics very funny. Clear Channel here in Orlando was one of the markets that canceled Stern and I wrote a letter to the local station manager in protest.

You're absolutely on target there, Fedral. The authors of the Constitution in writing the First Amendment went clear back to the ancient Egyptians who despite the construction of their government encouraged the free exchange of ideas. They didn't even prosecute citizens for speaking out against what the Pharoah dictated. It just didn't provide for a way to replace him -- that was left up to the hierarchy itself to take care of it by poisoning his food or hoping he would die of old age (although they had the disadvantage of having him often replaced by someone worse). That method is still with us in the world, hopefully never in the U.S.A. :wink: <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/>

Ties between Clear Channel and the Bush admistration are well-documented. Only after Stern turned against Bush was he pulled. Many ex-Clear Channel employees have since come forward to tell similar stories about firings over anti-govt., anti-big business, or anti-war statements. Please....this is government involvement, not a simple corporate decision. The FCC is debating delaying any fines to Stern until after the election. Not only that, suddenly, Colin Powell's son, who heads up the FCC is reconsidering the proposed "three strikes and you're out" bill, as it just might step on first amendment rights.

The first ten amendments were part of twelve proposed amendments sent to the states in September, 1789, by the First Congress, over the signature of Augustus Muhlenberg, then the Speaker of the House. The first two amendments proposed were that there be one representative for each 50,000 citizens, which has never been ratified; and the second proposed amendment, which reads: No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened. --was ratified May 7, 1992, more than two hundred years later. The first amendment ratified, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. --was the third proposed amendment.

These proposed amendments were promulgated by the members of the First Congress. If any of them were members of the constitutional convention, that is simply coincidence; it is simple coincidence that the above cited amendment is the first amendment. It is a common error to ascribe the "bill of rights" to the Founding Fathers. In fact, many members of the constitutional convention opposed ratification of the constitution; most of them, with George Mason being the most prominent of them, because it contained no bill of rights.

That woman was mentally slipping before, but its starting to turn into a landslide now...

I'll keep hoping that she winds up falling in love with some liberal who's a member of the NAACP with skin as black as midnight, and they get married and start makin' babies at a frantic pace.

The collective head explosion from her obedient, brain diseased followers would be quite a sight.

Yes, you are right. But the reason that graffiti results in a fine is not because of its content but just because it is trashing public property. It would result in a fine even if it was a good message wouldn't it? If so, I don't think using graffiti on public property argument can apply to regulating public airways since in the latter case we are discussing content.

The graffiti example illustrates that regardless of content the venue chosen determines what is and is not free speech more so than the content does.

Radio waves are public domain. This is not a free speech issue.

For example, broadcast television operates under different restrictions than cable.

On cable the tit flash could be followed up by a graphic orgy. The reason is because it is not on public domain and people have a way to block those channels.

On public airwaves that can't be blocked it is a different story.

Venue is paramount when alleging an infringement on free speech. The complainst about free speech here might sound good because of the general notion of what constitutes free speech to you, but in a legal definition it doesn't hold water at all.

Forgive me but I believe that you are comparing apples and oranges, both of them are fruit but they are different.

On the airways and public tv the content of speech does determine what is allowed and not allowed to be aired or shown, on public property the content does not matter. Its pretty simple really.

I am not saying that some censoring shouldn't be applied on TV and other places, in fact I believe that normal reasonable censoring should be applied. In other words it would totally inappropriate for a graphic love scene or violence to be aired on any disney show or nickelonian. (and they better not mess with my grandchild's barney show ) <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/> But I think that they are going overboard in taking Howard Stern off the air and the Janet Jackson incident was way overblown. Also I think the road in censoring is a recipe for extremist religionist to start deciding what we can watch and listen to.

The other morning or night I was watching the news and there was this rap singer or someone protesting what is being done to rap singers in some city. They are profiling rap artist because of their lyrics in their songs. The person doing the interviewing was saying stuff like, "well, the songs do incite violence and encourage gangsters..." and I thought how hypercritical. What about all those Mob shows like the Godfather and the Sopranos. Are they profiling those actors for acting like they are mobsters, in effect glorifying mobsters?

What I am trying to get at is that it is a thing that could easily get out of hand and chances are it wouldn't be fair. Just my opinion.

The Religious Right and Contemporary American Politics
</headline>
<post author="Lola" datetime="2004-11-16T14:27:00" id="p1">
Let's try this for a while. I hope it doesn't get so hot the thread is shut down, so I'm asking everyone to behave themselves......... no name calling please.

Let's post and discuss any instance that comes to our attention involving the religious right. I will also, as long as I have the time, post some statistics about the religious right along the way.

I suppose I will have to post a disclaimer before we start since many of you persist in hearing me say that I think all Republicans are religious fanatics. I know lots of non-fanatical Republicans. In my opinion, these people are guilty only of silence.

On this thread, I'm referring to religious fanatics, extremists with whom most of us do not agree and probably have a hard time abiding. The subject I propose to study here is the influence on contemporary American politics, especially in the last thirty years, of the fanatical, mostly evangelical Christian right.

For the purpose of ease, we should come up with a designation we can use to identify this group. It's hard to pin them down since, not all evangelicals are fanatics. Not all Christians are fanatics either and not all fanatics are Christians. They refer to themselves as "fundamentalist evangelical Christians." But even this designation doesn't entirely work because, some fundy evangelical Christians (only a rare few) are not fanatics either. So let's just refer to them for the purpose of discussion as the FFARR (the far far American religious right). But for short let's just call them the FAR.

For our first quotation:

<quote>
Fate of Sen. Specter may be decided soon

Speculation is running high in the press that Senator Arlen Specter will gain the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee despite his militantly pro-abortion views. The now-ubiquitous Specter is telling every media outlet that will listen that he has no abortion litmus test and would not presume to warn President Bush on nominees. Yet his comments to the contrary a day after the recent election and his lengthy liberal record continue to reverberate in the halls of the U. S. Senate. Several senators have expressed concern about the prospect of a Specter chairmanship. The latest to do so is Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a Judiciary Committee member who several years ago was denied a federal judgeship because of his conservative, pro-life views and the fierce opposition of Arlen Specter. Sessions indicated yesterday that the chairmanship of the committee should not automatically be decided by seniority. Other members of the Judiciary Committee have refused to give their support to Specter despite pressure to do so. Many senators will meet with Specter today to discuss his future and, depending on what he tells them, his fate will likely be determined soon. We will be profoundly disappointed if Specter wins this fight. Please keep up the pressure on the Senate. If you have not yet communicated with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee please contact them today at the link below.

At last, here is some rare good news from the Family Research Council (FRC).

It comes as a hard blow to them that they can't get their way all the time. But even if they have an occasional loss, they win more times than many people want to admit.

I know there are some of you who are itching to point out to me that this is proof that the FAR is not influential, however one instance of failure does not a non-influential force make. So maybe we can dispense with that much repeated discussion and go on to more productive work.

The following quotation is from Blatham. I think it's a good beginning point to set the up our discussion. Because it's clear that the FAR cannot win an election alone. They are a minority. It's true that they are being used as they are using the other forces driving the current political scene. But all together, we can see the tactic as one of division.

<quote>
The politics of division.

Since the last election, GOP strategists have been open regarding the need/wish to increase their percentage of the catholic and jewish votes. They failed with the jewish vote, but succeeded with the Catholic vote, as the analysis shows.

How did they achieve that? First off, we ought to assume that some percentage of the catholic gain was a consequence of the overall gain on terrorism/security issues which seems to have affected most electoral populations.

Secondly, organization, as the analysis shows.

But third, by forwarding a particular type of divisiveness though abortion and gay issues.

Now, let me tell you what I really think. Both of these issues, security and social, are driven by the promotion of fear. Fear of instability. Fear of change. Fear of the other or the alien.

And the solution to these fears is to trust in Authority - the government, the priest, the scripture, the literal. It is an easy and welcome relinquishment of an already shallow commitment to self-governance.

<post author="Acquiunk" datetime="2004-11-16T14:50:00" id="p2">
To Blathams three fears, instability, change and the other, I would add a fourth, maginalization. Many on the right, particularly the religious right seem to have this inordinate sense of insignificance. That others with improper if not immoral values and goals are setting an agenda that they can do nothing about. I can not recall the name of the individual or the source, (it may have been the NYT) but one evangelical minister explained the election results by observing that evangelicals had been dragged by events to the very edge of the clift, looked over the edge and decided to fight back.

<post author="dyslexia" datetime="2004-11-16T15:22:00" id="p3">
perhaps a bit of history to start the ball rolling; In 1960 a Roman Catholic, John F. Kennedy, ran for president, and a number of evangelical Protestants were afraid that a Catholic in the White house would give the Vatican too much influence in the United States. In May, the Southern Baptist convention spoke in opposition to the election of a Roman Catholic to the office of the President of the United States. A few Protestants, including the advocate of positive thinking, Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, formed an ad hoc group called the National Conference of Citizens for Religious Freedom, dedicated to opposing Kennedy's election. But unlike the election year of 1928, when Al Smith ran for president, in 1960 the issue of Catholicism evaporated. A greater issue was that of a missile gap, Kennedy claiming there was a missile gap.

Kennedy favored an aggressive policy against Communism. Nevertheless, he came under attack by some outspokenly anti-Communist Protestants. They considered Kennedy a liberal. Kennedy was, after all, Harvard educated and a Democrat. They spoke of moral decline and Armageddon and of Communism as foremost in leading the world toward ruin. The Communists, they believed, in addition to advocating slavery, were the world's foremost libertines and foremost in advocating the abandonment of God's laws.

Leading the charge against Kennedy, liberalism and Communism was Billy James Hargis, from Tulsa Oklahoma. Hargis had failed at study but had been ordained into the ministry after having been at the Ozark Bible College a year and a half, having left before receiving grades in his courses. He called himself Dr. Hargis but was later to say that his real education came from the hard knocks of life. He was another who believed himself to be gifted by intuition. His intuition led him to attack the National Education Association and the mass media. He accused mainline Protestant churches as having become infested with Communist sympathies. And he charged that the federal government was being directed by pro-Communists, by people who were parading under the name of liberal. The nation, he said, was in the hands of a group of Harvard radicals, hooked on "the insidious dope of socialism." Their hearts, claimed Hargis, "bled for the whole world but not for the United States." Since 1959 a case had been working its way through the courts concerning prayer in public schools. In 1962 the case reached the Supreme Court, and in June 1963 the justices of the Supreme Court ruled 6 to 1 that reverential Bible reading and prayer recitation had no place in the classrooms of public schools. Some Protestants were outraged. With Christianity not being openly expounded in their public schools, some Christians became more concerned that kids were being taught things that might subvert their brand of Christianity. Opposition to the teaching of evolution arose. The John Birch Society -- an anti-Communist and largely Protestant group -- joined those concerned with the schools, and in the early sixties their membership rose to more than one million. In the late fifties the leader of the John Birch Society, Robert Welch, had raised the question whether the President, Dwight Eisenhower, was part of the worldwide Communist conspiracy. In 1962, the John Birch Society announced that the Communist conspiracy controlled 50 to 60 percent of the United States (more than Lenin controlled Russia at the time of his revolution). And the John Birch Society claimed that Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement were instruments of subversion.
In the seventies, an estimated 24 million people tuned in weekly to listen to preachers like Billy Graham, Oral Roberts, Pat Robertson, Jim and Tammy Bakker, Jimmy Swaggert and Jerry Falwell.
What we seem to see in todays world is reaction and fear of change, capitalism is not answering to the basic needs of society and neither is the tradition sources such as "the church" To go back to the good old days, the agrarian days, the wholesome days when we all believed salvation on earth and in heaven would come by good clean living and hard work and, of course baptism, well, this option no longer seems available so the FAR reaches into their collective back-pockets and pull out and old boggieman-satan, the tried and true "elite/liberal" that is as strong a symbol of supression as can be handily found. Their (FAR) real enemy is slinking off with their dollars in hand as their hopeful eyes gaze heavenward.

That was grand, Dys! I'm eternally grateful.

Good ole Billy James. I sat through many a tirade by that man. He would not stop talking. Sometimes he'd go on for two hours when he was scheduled for one. He went on and on saying that Southern Methodist University was "the Red Bed of Communism" That phrase still rings in my head today. For a little girl, my age at the time was about 9 to 11 y.o., two hours of ranting and raving was too much to take. So I went crazy and became a liberal.

Anyway, that's an aside. Thanks, Dys for your beginning history lesson. It was very enlightening.

How fascists coopted religious fundamentalism
The American fascist would prefer not to use violence. His method is to poison the channels of public information. With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth to the public, but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money or more power.

Italian philosopher Giovanni Gentile, who wrote the entry in the Encyclopedia Italiana that said: "Fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power."

As the 1983 American Heritage Dictionary noted, fascism is: "A system of government that exercises a dictatorship of the extreme right, typically through the merging of state and business leadership, together with belligerent nationalism."

Thom Hartmann wrote: fascism/corporatism is "an attempt to create a 'modern' version of feudalism by merging the 'corporate' interests with those of the state." Feudalism, of course, is one of the most stable of the three historic tyrannies (kingdoms, theocracies, feudalism) that ruled nations prior to the rise of American republican democracy, and can be roughly defined as "rule by the rich."

Thus, the neo-feudal/fascistic rich get richer (and more powerful) on the backs of the poor and the middle class, an irony not lost on author Thomas Frank, who notes in his new book "What's The Matter With Kansas" that, "You can see the paradox first-hand on nearly any Main Street in middle America - 'going out of business' signs side by side with placards supporting George W. Bush."

The businesses "going out of business" are, in fascist administrations, usually those of locally owned small and medium- sized companies. Some in big business "are willing to jeopardize the structure of American liberty to gain some temporary advantage." "Monopolists who fear competition and who distrust democracy because it stands for equal opportunity would like to secure their position against small and energetic enterprise [companies]. In an effort to eliminate the possibility of any rival growing up, some monopolists would sacrifice democracy itself."

In Sinclair Lewis's 1935 novel "It Can't Happen Here," a conservative southern politician is helped to the presidency by a nationally syndicated radio talk show host. The politician - Buzz Windrip - runs his campaign on family values, the flag, and patriotism. Windrip and the talk show host portray advocates of traditional American democracy as anti-American.

When Windrip becomes President, he opens a Guantanamo-style detention center, and the viewpoint character of the book, Vermont newspaper editor Doremus Jessup, flees to Canada to avoid prosecution under new "patriotic" laws that make it illegal to criticize the President.

As Lewis noted in his novel, "the President, with something of his former good-humor [said]: 'There are two [political] parties, the Corporate and those who don't belong to any party at all, and so, to use a common phrase, are just out of luck!'

The idea of the Corporate or Corporative State, Secretary [of State] Sarason had more or less taken from Italy." And, President "Windrip's partisans called themselves the Corporatists, or, familiarly, the 'Corpos,' which nickname was generally used."

Lewis, the first American writer to win a Nobel Prize, was world famous by 1944, as was his book "It Can't Happen Here." And several well-known and powerful Americans, including Prescott Bush, had lost businesses in the early 1940s because of charges by Roosevelt that they were doing business with Hitler.

The fascist molders of the FAR's doctrines have been very clever. Their goals are political and economic power. They hid their methods by wrapping themselves in religious and patriotic costumes and rhetoric. They became expert at developing and exploiting "wedge" issues that establish them-against-us fears. Fear is their major weapon. Religion's long history is one of fear exploitation to gain power.

Long ago, they established their campaign bases in evangelical churches around the country. They financed their campaigns through tithing by their church members. They used radio and television to expand their movement and develop soft-sell inducements for fund raising. They accumulated enormous sums of money, some of which was used for their churches and their members. They formed church corporations and took advantage of the tax and reporting exemptions for religious institutions. Huge amounts of money went into the pockets of the movement's leaders. Enormous sums of money went to politicians to further their goals.

Their reward came during the 2004 presidential election. Now they are looking for their political and economic payoffs. They will attempt to disguise their demands as religious but, in fact, their goal for political and economic power has not changed. Only the spin has changed and gotten better. Fear is still the dominant tool.

Be afraid; be very afraid.

Christian Coalition Rates the U.S. Senate, 2004
To see Senate scorecards produced by the League of Conservation Voters, a consortium of environmental organizations, compared to the scorecards produced by three dominionist organizations, the Christian Coalition, the Family Research Council, and the Eagle Forum, click here. (These tables were provided by Glenn Scherer of Grist Magazine, October, 2004.)

The graph on the right is based on Christian Coalition scorecards. It shows how often members of the U.S. Senate voted with or against Christian Coalition supported bills. Republicans are red, Democrats are blue. Forty-one out of fifty-one Republican Senators received scores of 100% from Christian Coalition, meaning they voted with Christian Coalition 100% of the time.

One Democrat received a score of 100% -- Zell Miller, (D-GA) who was in the national spotlight when he spoke at the Republican convention. Thirty-one out of forty-eight Democrats and one independent received scores of 0. This graph indicates that there are basically three moderate Republicans in the U.S. Senate: Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins from Maine. Those three Senators are in the sixty percent column.

Do you know these people?
United States Senate Republican Leadership

Bill Frist, TN Mitch McConnell, KY Rick Santorum, PA

Bob Bennet, UT Kay Bailey Hutchinson, TX Jon Kyl, AZ George Allen, VA
They are the seven highest ranking Republican Senators in the U.S. Senate.

Every one of them received a scorecard of 100% from Christian Coalition.

That means they voted with Christian Coalition 100% of the time. They all received scores of 0 to 8% from the League of Conservation Voters -- a consortium of environmental groups.

How were people representing such an extreme ideological point of view elected to the top positions in the Republican Party? The leaders of the Republican Party were chosen by their colleagues who share their values.

Christianization of the Republican Party: In Their Own Words
Christianization of the Republican Party, an article from the The Christian Statesman, claims,

Once dismissed as a small regional movement, Christian conservatives have become a staple of politics nearly everywhere. Christian conservatives now hold a majority of seats in 36% of all Republican Party state committees (or 18 of 50 states), plus large minorities in 81% of the rest, double their strength from a decade before. The twin surges of Christians into GOP ranks in the early 1980s and early 1990s have begun to bear fruit, as naive, idealistic recruits have transformed into savvy operatives and leaders, building organizations, winning leadership positions, fighting onto platform committees, and electing many of their own to public office.

To add to my earlier post: I think that eventually, the Religious Right will realize that they have been manipulated by corporate interests to front for their goals in the contest for power in the US. That's why I use the term fascist to describe the manipulators. I'm not saying that the Religious Right is necessarily fascist; I'm saying that they have been manipulated by corporate fascists.

I feel sad that these devout people, who hold genuine and deeply felt religious ideals, will feel betrayed by those who used them to reach their own goals. I think they will be shocked to discover the duplicity of the elite wealthy class who used them to cover their true agenda.

Am I the only one who marveled at the suspicion the Religious Right held against John Kerry, whom they saw as a wealthy man, but considered George Bush to be one of them, a common man. They turned a blind eye to George Bush's wealth and that of his family. They fell for George Bush's folksy personality and communication style, thinking he is one of them. This reflects their strong suspicion of anyone they believe is an intellectual elite. I suspect this reflects their strong negative reaction to anyone they perceive as feeling superior to them.

The Religious Right has fallen for the myth that they are George Bush's true base. In fact, at a taped gathering, George Bush addressed a group of wealthy corporate donors earlier this year saying, "Some say you are only my campaign contributors; I say you are my base." I wonder what the Religious Right would think about that if they knew the truth of what Bush said?

I think the Religious Right used Bush as a candidate they could control. So these two forces have joined hands to achieve both of their goals. This is the greatest threat to the US.

Estimate of Political Strength
The drive for "dominion" is underestimated by the media and political analysts. Karl Rove estimates the number of people from the religious right who voted for Bush in 2000 to be about 15 million, and he talked about raising that number to 19 million. With the religious right's passion to gain control of the federal court system and its ability to send followers to the polls by the busload, Rove's goal could be modest.

The magazine Campaigns and Elections published a study in their February issue, 2002, evaluating the relative strength of the Religious Right in state Republican Parties. They are weak in seven state Republican Parties, all in the Northeast. The color-coded maps to the right demonstrate a shift from the year 1994 (top) to the year 2000 (bottom). Red is strong, green moderate, and yellow weak. The study's conclusion:

" In 2000, Christian conservatives were perceived to hold a strong position in 18 state Republican parties, the same number as in the 1994. The moderate category had 26 states, exactly twice the 1994 number. And the weak category declined to seven cases, down from 20 six years prior. Clearly, the biggest change was the increase in the moderate category, but there was considerable movement in all categories."

"The Fifteen Percent Solution: How the Christian Right Is Building From Below To Take Over From Above" by Greg Goldin was originally published in the Nation in 1993. Quoting moderate Republicans from Goldin's article:

""What the Christian right spends a lot of time doing," says Marc Wolin, a moderate Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Congress from San Francisco last year, "is going after obscure party posts. They try to control the party apparatus in each county. We have a lot to fear from these people. They want to set up a theocracy in America."" According to Craig Berkman, former chairman of the Republican Party in Oregon:

"They have acquired a very detailed and accurate understanding of how political parties are organized. Parties are very susceptible to being taken over by ideologues because lower party offices have no appeal to the vast majority of our citizenry. Many precincts are represented by no one. If you decide all of a sudden because it's your Christian duty to become a precinct representative, you only need a few votes to get elected.

Increasingly, they have the key say-so on who will be a delegate at the national convention, and who will write the party platform and nominate the presidential candidate. In a state like Oregon, with 600,000 registered Republicans, it is possible for 2000 or 3000 people to control the state party apparatus. If they are outvoted by one or two votes, parliamentary manipulations begin, and after two or three hours of discussion about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, the more reasonable people with other things to do leave, and in the wee hours of the morning, things are decided. That's how they achieve their objectives."

The Christian Right's Humble Servant
The Christian Right's Humble Servant
By Max Blumenthal, AlterNet
Posted on November 15, 2004, Printed on November 16, 2004
<a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/20499/">http://www.alternet.org/story/20499/</a>

Only a few days after 9/11, a shaken George W. Bush invited a small group of evangelical leaders to the White House to offer him spiritual counsel. There, they quietly discussed Scripture and the implications of 9/11 for a few moments. Then former Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) president James Merritt turned to the president with a few words of encouragement.

"Mr. President, you and I are fellow believers in Jesus Christ," Merritt said.

Bush shook his head affirmatively.

"We both believe there is a sovereign God in control of this universe."

Bush nodded again.

"Since God knew that those planes would hit those towers before you and I were ever born, since God knew that you would be sitting in that chair before this world was ever created, I can only draw the conclusion that you are God's man for this hour," Merritt stated.

It was then that Bush lowered his head and cried.

Three years later, the nation was bitterly divided and God's pre-destined president was plunged in a fight for his political life. Without a domestic plank to run on and a staggering record of failure to run from, Bush's re-election was no longer the slam dunk it was once thought to be. Had Bush not cultivated the Christian right as his power base or courted its leadership as his informal advisors, re-election would have been impossible. Indeed, while the presence of Bush consigliere Karl Rove in the White House blurred the lines between policy and politics, the influence of the Christian right on Bush's domestic agenda formally wedded the familiar bedmates of conservative ideology and Calvinist theology. With a disciplined voting bloc at its disposal, the Christian right pushed for increased influence on the White House in a second Bush term, rallying support for his re-election behind church walls, at stadium-sized rallies and across radio waves - often away from the media's gaze but always in the shadow of the offical Bush/Cheney campaign. And when they helped carry Bush to an unlikely but overwhelming victory on November 2, he - and the Republican party, by extension - were secured as the Christian right's humble servants.

"Bush's victory not only establishes the power of the American Christian right in this candidacy, but in fact established its power to elect the next Republican president," lamented Arthur Finkelstein in an interview with the Israeli daily Ma'ariv. Finkelstein, who is an advisor to New York's moderate Republican governor George Pataki, added that the "Republican party became the Christian right, the most radical in modern history ever."

To be sure, Bush is not a dyed-in-the-wool theocrat. When he kicked alcohol and became an evangelical Christian, it was the mainstream evangelical icon Billy Graham who oversaw his rebirth. And though he was involved in evangelical bible study groups in Midland, Texas in the 1980s, it was not until he declared a run for the Texas governorship that he was exposed to the hardline ideology of the Christian right. In 1993, as Bush groped for an approach to handling poverty that would set him apart from the mold of the mean-spirited, Gingrichian grinch, Rove invited self-described "social Calvinist" intellectual Marvin Olasky to join the campaign as Bush's social welfare guru.

In his influential polemic, "The Tragedy of American Compassion," Olasky put forth his theory that poverty is a spiritual problem that government policy has not caused and can not necessarily cure. Thus, Olasky argued, government should loosen its grip on the social sector and return it to the biblically-ordained care of the church. Olasky's theories were to a large extent derived from the teachings of 19th century neo-Calvinist politician Abraham Kuyper, (Olasky is a Kuyper Institute fellow) who declared, "The family, the business science, art, and so forth are all social spheres, which do not owe their existence to the state... but obey a high authority within their own bosom; an authority that rules by the grace of God...." Bush took this essentially theocratic idea and with Olasky's help, repackaged it as "compassionate conservatism," a label that helped cast Bush as a moderate in the media spotlight.

However, to those among the Christian right who understood the gravity of Olasky's influence on the Texas governor, Bush's rise was cause for encouragement. And Bush's friends in the corporate community, meanwhile, were soothed by the anti-government, laissez faire ideology undergirding his "compassionate conservatism." To them, Bush wore his religion on his sleeve like any other president; his Christian fundamentalist agenda was little more than free market fundamentalism with a pious patina.

Eight years later, the widely accepted perception of Bush as a "uniter" had helped smooth his path into the Oval Office. In one of his first acts as president, with support from centrist Democrats like Sen. Joe Lieberman, Bush put Olasky's ideas into action by establishing the Office of Faith Based Initiatives in January, 2001. The office essentially ceded a portion of government's social welfare responsibilities to religious groups. With Olasky standing by his side at the signing ceremony, Bush declared, "compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government," a seemingly benign statement with theocratic undertones that rang throughout the fundamentalist community. Indeed, beside transforming the federal government into an ATM machine for the religious right, establishing the office was a bold statement of Bush's commitment to the conservative Christian worldview.

Congress' passage of a ban on late-term abortions in November, 2003 - again with centrist Democratic support - presented Bush with yet another opportunity to burnish his credentials with the religious right. As Bush signed the bill flanked by Christian right mandarins like Jerry Falwell, Lou Sheldon and Sen. Rick Santorum - an image seemingly calculated to rankle the 100 Planned Parenthood activists protesting outside the White House - cries of the ceremony's 400 attendees erupted in cries of "Amen!" Later that day, Bush celebrated privately with a virtual who's who of the religious right, including Falwell, radio host Janet Parshall, SBC leader Richard Land and National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) president Ted Haggard, who leads a 14,000 member church in Colorado Springs, Colo. Together, they joined hands and prayed.

"Following the prayer," Falwell wrote in an email to his followers, "I told President Bush the people in the room represent about 200,000 pastors and 80 million believers nationwide who consider him not only to be our president but also a man of God."

The meeting underscored the Bush administration's acute sensitivity to its base. By the time Bush signed the late-term abortion ban, conference calls with religious right leaders like Haggard, Falwell and Focus on the Family's James Dobson had become a weekly affair. Leading the calls were veterans of the religious right like White House public liaison Tim Goeglein (former spokesman for Gary Bauer) and southeastern regional campaign director Ralph Reed (former director of the Christian Coalition). "We have direct access," Haggard told the Wall Street Journal. "I can call [Goeglein], he'll take my concern to the president and get back to me within 24 hours."

During a January conference call led by Bush, SBC's Richard Land and Focus on the Family's James Dobson urged the President to endorse a Constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in his State of the Union. Though Bush would not address the issue in his State of the Union, he assured Dobson and Land that his endorsement would be forthcoming. A month later, just after San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom had begun marrying gay couples, Bush made good on his promise.

The language Bush used to explain his decision to endorse the amendment sounded remarkably like the language Dobson and others would have used to demand it: "A few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most fundamental institution of civilization," Bush said at a Feb. 24 press conference. To many homosexuals, Bush's comment came as an insult (did Bush consider them barbarians?). However, to conservative Christians, the comment was yet another coded statement of Christian conviction. "Here is a man who is simply committed to a system of beliefs," Dobson said of Bush to the Post.

Indeed, from a conservative Christian standpoint, homosexuality is a danger to civilization because it threatens all social spheres, not just the family, making it in many ways a more salient issue than abortion. As the Rev. Ronnie Floyd of First Baptist Church in Springdale, Ark. told the Post, gay marriage "is different from abortion. It touches every segment of society, schools, the media, television, government, churches. No one is left out."

According to Frederick Clarkson, a leading researcher on the religious right and author of "Eternal Hostility: The Battle Between Theocracy and Democracy," the conservative Christian notion that gay marriage undermines civilization is "part of the idea that all homosexuals have a pathological need to spread their lifestyle. And that homosexuality is a matter of choosing perversion. It's threatening [to conservative Christians] and they want to protect their children from it." Hence, the need for the Federal Marriage Amendment.

Asked in the third presidential debate whether he believed homosexuality is a choice, Bush ducked the question. "I just don't know," he told the moderator, Bob Schieffer. He went on to reiterate his call for a Constitutional amendment barring gay marriage because, "it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman." It was yet another coded suggestion of the threat homosexuality poses to civilization. Having garnered Bush's full support for their touchstone issue, the religious right was happy to endure the parade of pro-choice RINO's (Republicans In Name Only) speaking at the Republican National Convention, and was unfazed by the fact that figures like Falwell were pointedly uninvited. Bush had done more than express the requisite sympathy for their beliefs as Ronald Reagan often did, he had become totally beholden to them. As Christian Coalition president Roberta Combs told a reporter during the convention, "We still own the president."

When the official Bush/Cheney re-election campaign kicked into high gear, the religious right's shadow campaign had been underway for nearly a year. The Southern Baptist Convention's Land had created a program to cultivate "values voters" called IVoteValues, which included a Web site rating candidates according to issues of concern to conservative Christians. Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, a legal arm of the Christian Coalition, sent mailers to 45,000 conservative pastors explaining how to rally support for Republican candidates without threatening their church's non-profit status. The Presidential Prayer Team, a private evangelical group bankrolled by Arizona Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo ran ads during the summer on 1,200 radio stations urging listeners to get on their knees and pray for the president.

The shadow campaign had received a much-needed injection of resentful rage when the Democrats and RINO's in congress flouted Bush and voted down the Federal Marriage Amendment. In response, Dobson used his popular radio show, which can be heard on 3,000 stations worldwide, to slam the "anti-family" liberals in congress. In September, when a new anti-gay marriage amendment was introduced in the House, Dobson began rallying support for a massive "Mayday for Marriage" rally on Washington DC for a gay marriage ban. Just three weeks before the election, around 150,000 conservative Christians gathered on the Mall to hear firebrand speeches denouncing gay marriage and of course, Kerry. "Sen. Kerry might be confused as to what marriage is, but we all know that marriage is between a man and a woman and no one else need apply!" declared Gary Bauer, whose political action committee, Campaign for Working Families, was running TV ads in swing states falsely accusing Kerry of supporting gay marriage.

Rightist evangelicals weren't the only ones determined to re-elect Bush, as the Catholic right joined the shadow campaign with equal enthusiasm. To the Catholic right, the former altar boy, John Kerry, was a "cafeteria Catholic" whose liberal social politics rendered him a heretic. So to ensure none of their flock strayed to Kerry's side, twelve bishops declared that voting for Kerry was a "grave, mortal sin." Bishop Michael Sheridan issued a pastoral letter to the 125,000 Catholics of Colorado Springs, Colorado calling the presidential election "critical" and stating that anyone who votes for a pro-choice, pro-gay civil union candidate like Kerry "ipso facto place[s] themselves outside full communion with the Church and so jeopardize their salvation." In other words, vote for Kerry, go to hell.

Grassroots right-wing Catholic activists were just as fired up about sinking Kerry's hopes as their bishops were. Earlier this year, two Northern Virginia Catholic activists, State Sen. Thomas Cucinelli and Terry Wear, approached the Republican National Committee's deputy Catholic outreach director, Martin Gillespie (brother of RNC president, Ed), about sparking a grassroots effort to increase Catholic turnout for Bush. Gillespie promptly hired dozens of field workers to canvass swing states for Catholic votes. Under Cucinelli's direction in Ohio, the RNC's field workers inundated parking lots outside Catholic churches with pro-Bush fliers the Sunday before election day. According to the Washington Times, Cucinelli's cadres unloaded 5 million fliers that day alone.

Though the Catholic shadow campaign was spearheaded by right-wing activists and Republican party operatives, it targeted so-called "swing" Catholics who are socially conservative but not necessarily Republican. As Leonard Leo, the RNC's Catholic outreach chairman, told the National Catholic Reporter, "Swing Catholics and faithful Catholics are often in accord on a number of the "culture of life" issues and I suspect that it is this combination of voters which will be pivotal in deciding who controls the Catholic vote in this election."

Evangelical groups relied on a similar tactic to increase turnout for Bush. One group, a 527 called the Citizen Leader Coalition, mounted a campaign to register and mobilize young 280,000 Christian voters in 10 swing states to vote for Bush. "This is a well-conceived and focused project which can be achieved by the dedicated efforts of a relative few and a realistic amount of money and resources, compared to what liberals are spending," the Coalition told potential donors on its Web site.

Part of the Coalition's campaign included inundating conservative churches with hundreds of thousands of voter guides contrasting Bush's positions with Kerry. While Bush appears on the right side of every issue on the voter guides, Kerry is accused of everything short of Satanism. Kerry "insists on judges who support the ACLU's radical anti-Christian, anti-God, anti-family agenda," the guide reads. The guide also falsely claims Kerry "supports gay marriage" and "participated in the Left's assault on [Mel] Gibson." The Citizen Leader Coalition was joined by dozens of other groups like the Traditional Values Coalition in distributing millions of voter guides to make sure conservative Christians knew the issues, or at least their version of them.

The voter guide tactic was derived from a brilliantly successful campaign by the California Pro-Life Council in 1990. In an effort to take over the California state GOP, the Council recruited 90 pre-screened "stealth" candidates to run for local office, none of whom even bothered to run a campaign. The Sunday before the election, Council activists hit church parking lots with 250,000 fliers plugging their candidates' Christian credentials. When the dust cleared, 60 of their 90 candidates were elected. A stunned local media dubbed the takeover, "The San Diego Surprise." As Clarkson pointed out in "Eternal Hostility," then-Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed quickly adopted the Council's tactic into his arsenal, making voter guides a staple of future Christian right campaigns.

For the Christian right, Bush was no different than any other stealth candidate. No matter how unqualified he was, no matter how shallow his understanding of policy might have been and whether or not he was outwitted by Kerry in the debates, they had pre-screened him and declared him one of their own. And they would reward him with their votes in record numbers.

While election-day exit polling relied on vague terms like "moral values" to produce inconclusive evidence about conservative Christian voters (do only fundamentalists have moral values?), they did reveal that the rate of voters who attended church once a week leapt by 2 points from 2000 and that 64 percent of them voted for Bush. Similarly, rates of anti-abortion voters increased by 3 points; they also voted for Bush almost unanimously. All in all, 79 percent of evangelicals voted for Bush. In Ohio, where 25 percent of the population is Catholic, Bush won a whopping 54 percent of the Catholic vote, a reflection of the Catholic right's intense opposition to Kerry and the success of the RNC's grassroots Catholic outreach efforts. He also won 79 percent of the evangelical vote there.

Having consolidated the Republican party as a vehicle for their moral uprising, the Christian right is certain to play a major role in shaping Bush's social policy for the next four years. With over two decades of grinding cultural battles behind them, their mood now seems to be a mixture of self-satisfaction and entitlement, as if their date with destiny has finally arrived. As the Christian right's direct mail wizard Richard Viguerie wrote in a post-election memo, "Now comes the revolution."

If I recall, the numbers of the "religious right" that voted in 2000 and in 2004 remained pretty much the same. I wonder where this sudden idea that they would "reward him with their votes in record numbers." comes from.

Let me ask this question...

If Kerry were elected, do you think he woould be Soros' butt-boy? Do you think Kerry would have given more credence to the extreme liberal agenda that helped him win the election?

I don't. I think Kerry would have been president first, liberal second. Just as Bush is president first, christian conservative second.

Faith based initiatives for all faiths?

The Office focuses its efforts on the following populations:

Substance abusers

I believe the intent of this thread is to be a critique of just what is the relationship of the religious (FAR) right and current politics in america. The intent, at least, is not to attack or defend either ideology but rather to explore and observe what influence, in any, currently manifests itself. Well, at least that's my intent.

I have always said that religious based organizations and non-profits are the best resources for providing services to vulnerable populations of all kinds.

My objections with faith based initiatives are:

The funds are coming from taxes. In the "good old days" private charities took care of people in need.

I don't care for the government picking and choosing WHICH faiths are going to be the recipients of this money.

I am trying to do just tsh Dys. The FAR right will have as much impact on the Bush presidency as the FAR left would have had on a Kerry presidency.

The only thing I have seen so far is the fear that something might happen in some future point.

Bush did not get elected by the 17% of christian conservatives that voted. He was elected by 51% of all the voters that voted. No way is he or his administration so politically naive as to succumb to pressure from ANY of the groups that helped him to office if it's going to alienate another section of the electorate.

I'm not so much in disagreement with you on this McG, I posted above a little history(current from 1960) about religion/politics as I remember it (although we could have gone much further back in our own history to such events as the great awaking parts 1 and 2, or even the Spanish invasion/cristianiation of the southwest or Piligrims but in the spirit of keeping things simpler I chose not to do that. There was certainly a backlash to Vatican II that I omitted that would also be very interesting re american politics. However it seems to me that the current issues are pretty much more straight foreward on concrete (abortion-prayer in school-stemcell research-gay rights) and I would find it of interest to explore these events in context with americans renewed religiousity. Fair enough?

Meanwhile, the most aggressive opponents of abortion began pushing a no-holds-barred approach to clear every possible obstacle from their path, including changing 200-year-old Senate rules that allow senators to block approval of nominees by filibustering.

While election-day exit polling relied on vague terms like "moral values" to produce inconclusive evidence about conservative Christian voters (do only fundamentalists have moral values?), they did reveal that the rate of voters who attended church once a week leapt by 2 points from 2000 and that 64 percent of them voted for Bush. Similarly, rates of anti-abortion voters increased by 3 points; they also voted for Bush almost unanimously. All in all, 79 percent of evangelicals voted for Bush. In Ohio, where 25 percent of the population is Catholic, Bush won a whopping 54 percent of the Catholic vote, a reflection of the Catholic right's intense opposition to Kerry and the success of the RNC's grassroots Catholic outreach efforts. He also won 79 percent of the evangelical vote there.

Meanwhile, the most aggressive opponents of abortion began pushing a no-holds-barred approach to clear every possible obstacle from their path, including changing 200-year-old Senate rules that allow senators to block approval of nominees by filibustering. Some even suggested blocking Specter's chairmanship by rewriting regulations so the current anti-abortion committee head wouldn't have to step down.

The issue here is marginalization. The religious right in this country seems to have an inordinate feeling of insignificance. A feeling that is out of proportion to their actual political if not cultural significance. Their world view seems to be that the " rise of multicultural internationalism' etc presents a set of moral values that are "immoral". That their moral values (which in their opinion are the correct values) are being over run by this immoral multicultural secular world. A lot of the energy of the evangelical movement in my opinion is derived from this fear of insignificance.

The FAR's Calvinism
Calvinism
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
Calvinism is a Protestant Christian doctrine named after John Calvin.

Calvin had international influence on the development of the doctrine of the Protestant Reformation, beginning at the age of 25, when he started work on his first edition of the Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1534 (published 1536). This work, which underwent a number of revisions in his lifetime, plus his polemical and pastoral works and a massive collection of commentaries on the Bible are the source of Calvin's ongoing personal influence on Protestantism.

Calvinism marks the second phase of the Protestant Reformation, when evangelical churches began to form following Luther's excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church. In this sense, Calvinism was originally a Lutheran movement. Calvin himself signed the Lutheran Augsburg confession in 1540. On the other hand, Calvin's influence first began to be felt in the Swiss Reformation, which was not Lutheran but rather, followed Huldrych Zwingli. It became evident that doctrine in the Reformed churches was developing in a direction independent of Luther's, under the influence of numerous writers and reformers, among whom John Calvin was pre-eminent, and thus this form of doctrine came to be called Calvinism.

Given that it has multiple founders, the name "Calvinism" is somewhat misleading if taken to imply that every major feature of the doctrine of the "Calvinist churches", or of all Calvinist movements, can be found in the writings of Calvin. The name applies generally to the Protestant doctrines that were held in common among the non-Lutheran national churches of Protestant countries and various minority Protestant reform movements, known as the Reformed churches, which formed outside of the Catholic Church in the latter two thirds of the 16th century (and in England in the 17th century).

Calvinism - Life is religion

The theological system and practical theories of church, family, and political life, all ambiguously called "Calvinism", are the outgrowth of a fundamental religious consciousness centered upon "the sovereignty of God". The doctrine of God is, in principle, given a pre-eminent place in every category of theology, including the Calvinist understanding of how a person ought to live. Calvinism presupposes that the goodness and power of God have a free, unlimited range of activity -- and, it works out as a conviction that God is at work in all realms of existence, including the spiritual, physical, intellectual realms, whether secular or sacred, public or private, in earth or in heaven. According to this viewpoint, the entire course of events is the outworking of the plan of God, who is the creator, preserver, and governor of all things without any exceptions, and whose will is consequently the ultimate cause of everything. This attitude of absolute dependence on God is not identified with temporary acts of piety, for example, such as prayer; rather, it is a sustained and all-encompassing pattern of life that in principle applies to digging ditches as well as taking communion. For the Calvinist Christian, all of life is the Christian religion.

Popular summations of Calvinist theology

Calvinim is often identified in the popular mind, with the "five points of the doctrines of grace", remembered by the English acronym: TULIP (http://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/topic/doctrinesofgrace.html).

Total Depravity

People in their natural, unregenerate state do not have the ability to turn to God. Rather it is the grace and will of God through the Spirit that causes men who are dead in sin to be reborn through the Word.

Romans 3:10-11 "None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God."

John 6:44 "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day."

1 Corinthians 2:14 "But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them."

Unconditional Election

Election means "choice". God's choice from eternity, of who He will bring to Himself, is not based on foreseen virtue, merit or faith in the persons He chooses but rather, is unconditionally grounded in His own mercy.

Romans 9:16 "So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy."

Ephesians 1:4 "Even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him."

John 1:13 "born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God."

Recommended book "Chosen by God" by R.C. Sproul ISBN 0842313354

Limited Atonement

Also called "particular redemption" or "definite atonement" meaning that, Christ's death actually takes away the penalty of sins committed by those upon whom God has chosen to have mercy. (As opposed to Christ's death making redemption merely a possibility that we can perform). It is "limited" then, to taking away the sins of the elect.

John 10:15 "I lay down my life for the sheep."

Acts 20:28 "shepherd the church of God that He obtained with the blood of His own Son."

Ephesians 5:25 "love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her."

Recommended book "Death of Death" by John Owen ISBN 0851513824

Irresistible Grace

The saving grace of God is not resistible. Those who obtain salvation do so because of the relentlessness of God's mercy. Men yield to grace, not finally because God found their consciences more tender or their faith more tenacious than other men. Rather, willingness and ability to do God's will, are evidence of God's faithfulness to save men from the power and the penalty of sin.

John 15:16 "You did not choose me, but I chose you."

Ephesians 1:11 "In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will."

1 Thessalonians 1:4-5 "For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit."

Romans 9:11 "though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad- in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of his call."

Colossians 2:13 "When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him."

Perseverance of the Saints

Also called the "Preservation of the Saints". Those whom God has called into communion with Himself through Christ, will continue in faith and will increase in faith and other gifts, until the end. Those who apparently fall away, either never had true faith to begin with, or else will return. Thus Calvinists do not subscribe to the "once saved, always saved" concept popular among many Christian denominations.

John 10:27-28 "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish."

1 John 2:19 "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us."

Philippians 1:6 "And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ."

These five points are a summation of the judgments or canons rendered by the Synod of Dort, which was published as a point-by-point refutation of the five points of the Arminian Remonstrance. They are not a summation of Calvin's writings, or of the theology of the Reformed churches. The central assertion of these canons is that, God is able to save from the tyranny of sin, from guilt and the fear of death, every one of those upon whom he is willing to have mercy. God is not frustrated by the unrighteousness or the inability of men because it is the unrighteous and the helpless that he intends to save.

Calvinism is often further reduced in the popular mind to one or another of the five points of TULIP. The doctrine of Unconditional election is sometimes made to stand for all Reformed doctrine, sometimes even by its adherents, as the chief article of Reformed Christianity. However, according to the doctrinal statements of these churches it is not a balanced view to single out this doctrine to stand on its own as representative of all that is taught. The doctrine of unconditional election, and its corollary in the doctrine of predestination are never properly taught, according to Calvinists, except as an assurance to those who seek forgiveness and salvation through Christ, that their faith is not in vain, because God is able to bring to completion all of His intentions to save. Nevertheless, non-Calvinist Christians strongly object that these doctrines are false and offensive, and that they discourage the world from seeking salvation.

While the idea of substitutionary atonement originated long before Calvinism (see Anselm of Canterbury), it is properly a doctrine that belongs to Reformed theology or Calvinism. This is because logically, if Christ substitutes for somebody's sins, that person must be saved. That is why historically Arminians have not held to substitutionary atonement but rather the governmental theory of the atonement.

These doctrinal emphases can be summarized in three words -- "God saves sinners":

It is God who saves, and not man.

Revelations 7:10 "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"

He really does save us to the uttermost, not just make salvation possible.
Hebrews 7:25 "Consequently, he [Jesus] is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them"

It is sinners whom He saves, not righteous people.

Luke 5:32 "I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance."

Attempts to reform Calvinism

Liberal reforms

Many efforts have been undertaken to reform Calvinism and especially the doctrine of the Reformed churches. The most notable and earliest of these was the theological and political movement called Arminianism, already mentioned in connection with the Synod of Dort. Arminianism was rejected by most Reformed churches, but ultimately prevailed in the Church of England, despite Calvinism being the formally adopted system of doctrine in that church.

Another revision of Calvinism is called Amyrauldianism, "hypothetical universalism", or "four-point Calvinism", which asserts that Christ's death atones for the sins of all men, but only those who repent and believe are elect and receive forgiveness. This doctrine was most thoroughly systematized by the French Reformed theologian at the University of Saumur, Moses Amyraut, for whom it is named. It was popularized in England by the Reformed pastor Richard Baxter, and gained strong adherence in the Presbyterian church in American colonies, during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the United States, Amyrauldianism is the most common form of Calvinism current among evangelical churches.

Baxter himself differentiated his proposals from those of Amyrauldianism, on several rather subtle points. Baxter's influential form of hypothetical universalism is often called neonomianism, and is generally considered a milder proposal of reform than Amyraut's version.

In the mainline Reformed churches, Calvinism has undergone significant revision through the influence of Karl Barth and neo-orthodox theology. Barth was an important Swiss Reformed theologian who began writing early in the 20th century, whose chief accomplishment was to counter-act the influence of the Enlightenment in the churches, especially as this had led to the toleration of Nazism in the Germanic countries of Western Europe. The Barmen declaration is an expression of the Barthian reform of Calvinism. The revisions Barth proposed are radical and impossible to concisely discuss in comparison to classical Calvinism but generally involve the complete rejection of natural theology. Conservative Calvinists (as well as some liberal reformers) regard it as confusing to use the name "Calvinism" to refer to neo-orthodoxy or the other liberal revisions mentioned above.

Conservative reforms

A more conservative revision of Calvinism gained influence in the Dutch Reformed churches, late in the 19th century, which has been dubbed "neo-Calvinism", and developed along lines of the theories of Dutch theologian, statesman and journalist, Abraham Kuyper. This revision was a response to the influences of the Enlightenment, but generally speaking did not touch directly on the articles of salvation. Neo-Calvinism is a revision of the Calvinist world-and-life view, which is an extension of the Calvinist understanding of salvation to scientific, social and political issues (though some Calvinists would argue that it is not so much a matter of revision as a matter of emphasis, citing the Institutes, book 1, chapters 1-3, and other works). In the United States, Kuyperian neo-Calvinism is represented among others, by the Center for Public Justice, a faith-based political think-tank headquartered in Washington, D.C.

Neo-Calvinism branched off in more conservative movements in the United States. The first of these to rise to prominence became apparent through the writings of Francis Schaeffer, and a group of scholars associated with a Calvinist study center in Switzerland, called L'abri. This movement generated a reawakened social consciousness among Evangelicals, especially in response to abortion, and was one of the formative influences which brought about the "Moral Majority" phenomenon in the United States, in the early 1980s.

Another Calvinist movement, more radical in the eyes of some, has been influential in American family and political life. This movement is called Christian Reconstructionism. Reconstructionism is a separate revision of Kuyper's approach under the leadership of the late Rousas J. Rushdoony, son of Armenian immigrants, Reformed scholar and essayist, who based much of his understanding on the apologetical insights of the late professor Cornelius Van Til. The movement has marginal influence in some of the conservative Reformed churches in which it was born, and in Calvinistic Baptist and charismatic churches mostly in the United States. Not a political movement, strictly speaking, Reconstructionism has been influential in the development of the so-called "religious right"; it aims toward the complete reconstruction of the structures of society on Christian and Biblical presuppositions, although not in terms of "top down" structural changes, but through the steady advance of the Gospel of Christ as men and women are converted. In keeping with the Theonomic Principle, it seeks to establish laws and structures that will best instantiate the ethical principles of the Old Testament, as expounded in the case laws and summarized in the Decalogue.

Hyper-Calvinism

Calvinism has frequently appeared in various forms, which are called "hyper-Calvinism" by critics of that version of doctrine, on the supposition that it is a corrupted form of Calvinism. Hyper-calvinism is not necessarily believed by anyone (indeed, it can't be believed in all of its varieties); it is a label applied to any extrapolation of a point of calvinism which undermines the theological system, sometimes mistakenly attributed to Calvinism by critics. The name "hyper-Calvinism" is also applied to beyond-orthodox reform movements, which attempt to improve Calvinism by removing perceived inconsistencies.

Many Calvinists may reject hyper-Calvinistic beliefs as destructive to the Christian faith, such as:

that God is the source of sin and of evil

that God from all eternity has acted to irresistibly compel men toward sin and unbelief, just as he pursues those upon whom he desires to have mercy

that men have no will of their own, and secondary causes are of no effect

that the number of the elect at any time may be known by men

that it is wrong to evangelize

that assurance of election must be sought prior to repentance and faith
that men who have once sincerely professed belief are saved regardless of what they later do

that God has chosen some races of men and has rejected others

that the children of unbelievers dying in infancy are certainly damned

that God does not command everyone to repent

that the sacraments are not means of grace, but obstacles to salvation by faith alone.

that the true church is only invisible, and salvation is not connected with the visible church

that the Scriptures are intended to be interpreted by individuals only and not by the church.

that no government is to be obeyed which does not acknowledge that Jesus is the Lord, or that Biblical Law is its source of authority

that the grace of God does not work for the betterment of all men

that saving faith is equivalent to belief in the doctrine of predestination

that only Calvinists are Christians

Of course, there are Calvinists who believe that these are not caricatures of Calvinism and conscientiously hold to some of them in the belief that these are a logical outworking of their faith. Such Calvinists vigorously object to being called "hyper-Calvinist".

The substance of Calvinism is total dependence on God. Every good thing any person has is there because of God's unmerited grace, and salvation is particularly dependent on grace. Calvinism is intentionally such that all credit, for everything, must go directly to God; humans are but miserable sinners. The "solas" exist to keep all the credit where it belongs, and to exclude any illicit additions such as those the Reformers claimed Catholics had made. The five solas were the summary of Calvinism, indeed of the Reformation, before the Framing of TULIP.[1]

Bush did not get elected by the 17% of christian conservatives that voted. He was elected by 51% of all the voters that voted. No way is he or his administration so politically naive as to succumb to pressure from ANY of the groups that helped him to office if it's going to alienate another section of the electorate.
</quote>

McG

Subtract 17 from 51 and what do you get? I'll let you do the math. I've never said the FAR represents enough of the electorate to elect a president. They have obviously made a deal with the other major components of Bush's base to significantly hold their silence about their most radical core beliefs in return for certain pay backs. This is a second term for Bush, a Lame Duck term so he's much more free to pay back now than he was before when he needed to be re-elected.

This is true, but also Bush himself is member of the FAR. He's deeply embedded in that sub-culture so his goals are the same as the FAR's. Obviously he still has to think about the next election and look out not to alienate the voters against the next candidate. But I think we're already seeing the FAR increase their demands about what they consider to be their due.

I would love nothing more than for them (the FAR) to feel so snookered that they form their own party. The Dems will find it much easier to win in this case. Not just because the Republicans will loose the 17% but also because if the reasonable religious voters begin to see how unreasonable and extreme is the FAR, they will begin to vote against them.

Please, settle down and let's discuss this in a reasonable way. We're not here to point out a truth, we're here to study the effects of the FAR on American politics. Many of us know what we believe, but we can still try to keep an open mind and look at history, consider recent events and see what we see. I really hate the way sniping interferes with the productive work of a thread. If we can, let's not snipe.

Defending a nation sometimes means going to war. Some people oppose war at all costs. It hardly constitutes "warmongering" although I understand how some people would like to propagandize it as such.

The only alienation of pro-choice advocates comes from the speculation of may happen in the future. Bush has certainly not hidden his personal philosophy of being against abortion, but I have yet to see him push any legislation ahead that would make abortion illegal.

Those no-bid contracts were pre-determined during Clinton's term. It's convenient that Cheney was in charge of Haliburton at the time, but has little influence on the no-bid contracts. Read up on it, I know much has been written about it.

Bush is a man of conviction for sure. However he is also the president of ALL the United States, not just the red ones. His administration will push an agenda that it thinks is best for all. It will not please everyone, but no president ever will.

I don't oppose war at all costs, but I do believe in the UN, and I do believe that Bush both oversold the war vis a vis WMD, and overexaggerated the relationship between Saddam and al Qaeda.

Well, he hasn't pushed anything through yet, but his views on same sex unions, stem cell research, and abortion all come from the same side of the spectrum. I find it hard to believe that someone with "such strong moral convictions" would stand idle as any of these things continued to take place.

Let us agreed that Bush is the president of all the citizens of the U.S. As unfortunate as that seems to a large number of people. It is a fact that he is. And let us assume (we can't know this) that he is doing what he considers to be best for all. And we'll agree also on the fact that no president will ever please every voter....horror of horrors.

And I suspect we can agree that there are many us, a huge percentage of the population, who don't agree with him that what he's doing is best for us all? This discussion is not limited to only those who agree on these points or those who disagree. These points of agreement and/or disagreement are not the subject of this thread. The subject of this thread is the effect of the FAR on American politics.

I don't oppose war at all costs, but I do believe in the UN, and I do believe that Bush both oversold the war vis a vis WMD, and overexaggerated the relationship between Saddam and al Qaeda.

HALLIBURTON.. THE REAL STORY

I am so completely sick and tired of hearing these Bush-hating, left-wing, Saddam-appeasing neo-socialists rant and rave about Halliburton that I could..... well... I could just spit. What morons. These are people who hate capitalism, hate the profit motive, and believe that every evil visited on the world is done so in the name of corporate greed. Losers all.

To listen to these irrational cretins you would think that this entire war in Iraq was being fought for one purpose, to enrich Halliburton. It would be not at all surprising if some of these anti-capitalist geeks believed that Bush arranged for those airplanes to fly into the World Trade Towers for that one purpose.. enriching Halliburton.

Try this experiment. The next time you hear some liberal parrot squawk about Halliburton just ask them one simple question. "Well, pal --- since you're such an expert on Halliburton, why don't you tell me just what it is that Halliburton does? Name one product or one service that Halliburton provides."

Don't hold your breath waiting for cogent answer.

Part of the perceived evil that is Halliburton is the fact that Dick Cheney once ran the company. As everyone knows, we should strive mightily to avoid ever placing anyone with the know-how and ability to run a multi-million dollar corporation in a position of responsibility in the political realm. Actually making a success of yourself in the private sector disqualifies you for public service, while not having any actual discernable private sector job skills is the supreme qualification for public service.

So... let's get to the bottom of this. Did Bush or Cheney do something underhanded or illegal in handing some rather lucrative contracts to Halliburton for infrastructure and other work in Iraq?

We'll start with another question you can ask your bedwetting leftist friends. Ask them if they've ever heard of LOGCAP. They will tell you that they don't know what that is. You won't be at all surprised. LOGCAP is the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program created by the United States Army. It is a program that uses a competitive bidding process to award a contract to a corporation to be on call to provide whatever services the Army might need... right then. Some brilliant thinkers in the Army came to the conclusion that it might not be such a swell idea to screw around with competitive bidding processes for logistics and other services during wartime. Imagine that.

Halliburton won the competitive bidding process for LOGCAP in 1992. They then lost that bidding process five years later in 1997. In spite of the fact that Halliburton no longer held the LOGCAP contract, Bill Clinton went ahead and awarded a no-bid contract to Halliburton to do some work in the Balkans supporting U.S. peacekeeping actions. Odd, isn't it. The same people who are screaming about Halliburton right now had absolutely nothing.. nada.. nunca.. not one thing to say about Halliburton when it was the Clinton Administration that was handing out contracts.. with no bidding, by the way. You might also be interested in knowing that Al Gore was quite a fan of Halliburton. Gore's reinventing government panel had some very complimentary things to say about Halliburton and the services it provides to the U.S. government. Ahhh... but what does Al Gore know, right?

That brings us to 2001. It's time for bidding on the LOGCAP contract again. Halliburton is right in there, and wins the bid. This means that at the time of the Iraq War Halliburton had the bid for providing logistical and other services to the U.S. government. They were the go-to company. So, along comes the U.S. Army with a fat contract for Halliburton to put out oil-well fires in Iraq and all hell breaks loose. To the left this is all the proof you needed to show that this whole war was about oil and enriching Bush pals.

Recap: Clinton awards no-bid contract to Halliburton at a time when Halliburton did not hold the LOGCAP contract. Bush awards contract to Halliburton at a time when Halliburton DID hold the LOGCAP contract.

So... one last question for your mindless leftist friends. Well.. make that two questions. Ask them if Clinton went into the Balkans to enrich Halliburton. They'll say no. Then ask them if Bush went to Iraq to enrich Halliburton. They'll say yes. At this point do all that you can to have your friend institutionalized.. for they are beyond all help.

</quote>

I'm not following you on this Acq., but it may be a mute point, given what I'm going to say next.

I do agree with you that members of the FAR are feeling helpless and unable to further their goals. And they have decided to fight back. My point is that the members of this most current version of the FAR have been organizing since 1980. And I'm identifying this date because it marks the beginning of a specific movement to influence the government of the U.S. That they're doing it because they feel they have no control and that the progressives are doing what they can for the same reason, is a given as far as I'm concerned.

It is a battle over values. Both sides value sets differ and are probably mutually exclusive. That's why it's known as the Culture Wars. Which value system is best is not the subject of this thread.
I can, however, admit to a motivation I have for starting the thread. And it's based on an assumption. My assumption is that there are many well meaning, God fearing Christians and other reasonable citizens who share many progressive values who do not realize 1. that this organization effort has been taking place and 2. that the force and value system behind the organization is as extreme and incompatible with progressive values as it is and 3. that the FAR is so close to achieving their goals.

My assumption is not provable. Or, that is, I know of no research that has taken this as a question to study. If anyone has any information about this, I would love to know about it.

I'll admit also to a wish of mine. I want to expose these aspects (1, 2 and 3, and maybe some others) to the light of day in order to increase awareness. I wish to discuss the history of the FAR, their values system, how the FAR has organized, what their numbers are and who seems to be behind it. As well as any information regarding how close they are to achieving their goals and whether or not they may be successful. Whether the value systems can co-exist is a subject, I think for another thread.

So can we agree to discuss this matter, given I have been direct and honest about my motivation and intent?

BBB posted an article which made this point:

<quote>
Not a political movement, strictly speaking, Reconstructionism has been influential in the development of the so-called "religious right"; it aims toward the complete reconstruction of the structures of society on Christian and Biblical presuppositions, although not in terms of "top down" structural changes, but through the steady advance of the Gospel of Christ as men and women are converted. In keeping with the Theonomic Principle, it seeks to establish laws and structures that will best instantiate the ethical principles of the Old Testament, as expounded in the case laws and summarized in the Decalogue.
</quote>

This I think BBB, is an excellent point in trying to focus on a key difference in the values of the FAR as opposed to those of less fanatical Christians. It defines what I believe to be the key point of disagreement. That is, that the members of the FAR are bound by an allegiance to authority alone in making individual decisions.

When they speak of "family values" they are really pointing to an adherence to a particular point of view about what constitutes proper family values. They are depending on authority alone. This is in contrast with those who believe that they can make their own moral judgements given specific circumstances.

Further, it is the FAR's wish to force others, through stringent laws, to be governed by the authority they believe to be the true authority. Let's see if we can find evidence for this in the present day tactics of the FAR.

One piece of evidence for this is the way in which the FAR is threatened by open education. If religion is taught, they want it to be only their religion or their religion to be taught as "truth." Schools which offer courses in religion (or sex education or science) in which all religions are treated as equal, that is, the subject is to study the beliefs of each religion, is considered by the FAR to be an attempt on the part of the Secular Humanists to cause their children to doubt. How can information create doubt where none is present? Why do they object so stridently to a survey course on religion?

The Triumphs of the New Right
By Frances FitzGerald
Richard Viguerie
(click for larger image)
The New Right: We're Ready to Lead
by Richard A. Viguerie, introduction by Jerry Falwell

The Sweetheart of the Silent Majority: The Biography of Phyllis Schlafly
by Carol Felsenthal

Just after the 1980 election the ABC show called "Nightline" put the satellite technology of television to work to create an extraordinary electronic encounter between Senator George McGovern, Senator Frank Church, Senator Birch Bayh, Jerry Falwell, and Paul Weyrich. The three just-defeated senators had never met their opponents before, and the two sides knew so little about each other that both were disarmed. Instead of the usual political fencing match the debate was a raw, emotional confrontation.

One of the strange things about the debate was the apparent imbalance of the two sides. Three leaders of the Democratic party with long careers in public office were pitted against a fundamentalist minister and an almost unknown political organizer. Yet as organizers for the New Right, Weyrich and Falwell represented a coalition that had raised more money for the 1980 election than the entire Democratic party nationally.

After that election, the New Right organizers could claim that they had helped to elect over two dozen senators and a great many more congressmen, who generally could be counted on to oppose the Supreme Court decisions on busing, school prayer, and abortion, as well as to support Reagan's economic and defense policies. "Nightline" did not invite any of the new senators to meet McGovern, Church, and Bayh, for good reason: the New Right was not created by politicians but by organizers.

In last week's issue, The Economist had a special report on America's religious right. They don't like it, but they don't seem to be overly alarmed and reach the following conclusion. Which more or less corresponds with my own view of the issue.

<quote orig_author="The Economist">
Attempts to ram conservative social policies into law look inevitable. They include the federal amendment banning gay marriage, though this is an uphill struggle that failed by 19 votes in the Senate last time round. Moreover, on the eve of the election, Mr Bush came out in favour of civil unions, which more than half the population, including many religious conservatives, favour. They also include extending a ban on "partial-birth abortion" to cover all third-trimester abortions, and, most important, appointing conservative judges to any Supreme Court vacancies.

This week there was a sign of what may be to come when Republicans threatened to strip Senator Arlen Specter of the chairmanship of the committee that oversees Supreme Court nominations after he said that staunch opponents of abortion were unlikely to be confirmed.

For opponents of Mr Bush, and also for many socially liberal Republicans, the election results and the trumpeted evangelical ambitions point to a big reversal: the victory of aggressive social conservatism over the small-government tradition in which morality is not legislated. It could, indeed, turn out to be something like this, but it need not. The wide variety of different opinions held by Mr Bush's religious supporters give the president, and his new administration, a lot of leeway, if they choose to look for it.

I disagree with the economist's analysis. A more appropriate model is the passage of the Prohibitionamendment and the appointment of judges that would tolerate racial segregation in the early 20th century. What the radical right did then was find issues more moderate senators and congressmen supported and traded support on those issues for support for their agenda. The issues then were; support for the US entry into WWI, and pro business tax and financial policies. In both cases they won. The result was the depression and organized crime. Something similar will happen here and I suspect the issues will be tax cuts and defence with a proactive foreign policy.

[election-day exit polling] did reveal that the rate of voters who attended church once a week leapt by 2 points from 2000 and that 64 percent of them voted for Bush.
</quote>

</quote>

Couple of things to mention here.

(1) First of all, to start with the basics, these numbers are incorrect - or incorrectly attributed, in any case. BBB (or rather, the author she quotes) seems to have confused two separate categories: those who attend church "more than weekly" and those who "attend church once a week".

The number of the former did indeed "leap" by 2% - from 14% to 16% of the total number of voters, to be precise. And it is of this group that 64% voted Bush.

The number of the latter, however, dropped by the very same 2% - from 28% to 26%. Of them, 58% voted for Bush.

Will come back to that later. First, let's continue.

(2) For one, focusing on those who attend church more than weekly, I'm not sure whether "leapt" is a verb that appropriately fits an in comparison unremarkable increase of just 2%. On the same count one could submit that the number of female voters "leapt" from 52% to 54% of the whole, that the number of voters between 45-59 and over 60 "leapt" from 28% to 30% and from 22% to 24%, respectively, that the number of those who are not married "leapt" from 35% to 37% - well, et cetera.

This is not just a semantic point I'm making. The point here is that the proportional increase of the most devout voters was of a relatively negligeable scale - or of a small enough scale, in any case, to make it merely one of many comparable elements that tipped the elections to George Bush.

And wait - there's more.

(3) First off, the similar increase of senior voters or of female voters can not just easily be attributed with as decisive an effect just because both groups made a similarly increased relative impact on the vote count. They can in fact be attributed such a role with much more reason. Because both women and seniors actually shifted their vote towards Bush to a significant degree. The devoutly Christian, on the other hand, were pretty much just as likely to vote for Bush this time as last time.

I.e.: in 2000, 43% of women voted for Bush. In 2004, 48% did. In 2000, 47% of seniors voted for Bush. In 2004, 54% did. However, of those who attend religious service more than weekly, 63% already voted for Bush in 2000, and 64% did now. Hardly any change there.

Calculate the effect here for a moment.

In 2000, women delivered Bush with (43% of 52% makes) 22% of the votes. Now they yielded him (48% of 54% makes) 26% of the votes. Net gain: 4%, more than his margin of victory this year.

In 2000, seniors delivered Bush with (47% of 22% makes) 10% of the votes; this time, they yielded him (54% of 24% makes) 13% of the total vote. Net gain: 3%, exactly the margin of his victory.

I'll add another group: inhabitants of big cities. In 2000, they made up just 9% of the electorate, and just 26% of 'em voted for Bush. Ergo: Bush voters from large cities made up just 2% of all voters. But in 2004, big city dwellers made up 13% of the electorate, and 39% of them voted for Bush. Ergo, the percentage of Bush voters from big cities more than doubled, to 5% of the electorate. Net gain: 3%, exactly the margin of his victory.

Now compare those who go to church more than weekly. In 2000, they delivered Bush with (63% of 14% makes) 9% of the votes; now, they yielded him (64% of 16% makes) 10% of the votes. Net gain: just 1%.

The most devout voters, in short, did not make the difference in 2004. That is to say: not to any greater degree than they did in 2000.

(4) Finally, to return to my first point re: BBB. Who do we talk about when we talk of the religious mobilisation? BBB referred, be it erroneously, to those who attend church once a week. If instead of looking at those who attend Church more than once a week, we do indeed take a bigger group - everybody who at least once a week attends religious service. Then the share of the electorate we are talking about of course more than doubles.

But - if we look at this larger group of the devout, their total share in the electorate did not actually increase since 2000, at all. After all, as we have seen above, while those who attend religious service more than once a week represented a 2% larger share of the electorate, those who attend service just once a week represented a 2% smaller share. Together, we are talking about 42% of the electorate in 2000 - and also 42% of the electorate in 2004.

What is more, neither of these groups showed any notable change in political inclination. We already saw that Bush increased his support among the most devout by just 1%. Well, among those who attend service once a week, he also increased it by just 1% - from 57% to 58%.

Taking these two groups together, those who attend religious service once a week or more often this time voted Bush 61% to 39%. In 2000, they voted Bush 59% to 41%. Compare this 2% increase in the Bush vote with the 5% increase among women, the 7% increase among seniors, the 9% increase among Latinos or the 9% and 13% increase among dwellers of small and large cities, respectively, to get it in the right proportions.

Basically, the larger group of people who go to service once a week or more and voted Bush also increased barely. They went from making up (59% of 42% makes) 25% of the electorate to making up (61% of 42% makes) 26% - a net gain of, again, just 1%.

-----------
In short: McGentrix is considerably more right than BBB was. If with the "religious right" we mean those who attend religious service at least once a week and vote for Bush then McG is right: their numbers remained pretty much the same in 2000 and in 2004. In 2000, they made up 25% of all voters; in 2004, 26%. Same goes for the smaller group of those who attend religious service more often still and vote Republican, as we have seen: their share also grew by just one percent, from 9% to 10% of all voters. In absolutes, their numbers will have increased - but by hardly any more than the number of other (less religious) voters did. Turnout increased among both groups in similar fashion.

Does that mean the "religious right" didn't yield Bush the elections? Well, since Bush won by just a 3% margin, any group of over 3% of the electorate can of course be said to have yielded Bush the elections. But whatever role the religious right played in terms of numbers in 2004, it was no different, and no larger a role than it was in 2000.

So if you want to take a look at how devoutly religious Republicans have been making up a quarter of the national vote for at least two Presidential elections, go right ahead. But if you want to find out why Bush won the popular vote in 2004 when he failed to do so in 2000 - if you want to understand the difference between then and now - then by all means, don't look at the religious Republicans, because they made no different an impact than they did last time.

Instead, look at the voter groups that did actually vote for Bush in much greater numbers now than then - Latinos, women, big city dwellers and seniors being examples in question. They might not fit the Bush-voter stereotype as well, but they are the ones that made this year's result different from the 2000 one.

I would opine that you really need to get on the way-back machine to Reagans election (especially the 2nd one) to see major voter turnout from a religious base that actually has been diminishing following Pat Buchanan into a moral minority of lesser and lesser impact.

Well, you basically already said it, McG - and much more concisely, too &lt;grins&gt;

Always good to find at least one something to agree on even with you! <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green"/>

There could well be exceptions to the above national picture on state level, by the way. The above percentages hold true for the national exit polls. But in individual states the devoutly religious may well have had an increased impact. <a href="http://www.able2know.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1018558#1018558">Some data</a> suggests they did so in the South, for example, be it mostly in states that were safe for Bush anyway. However, whatever greater impact they might have had in some (Southern) states, apparently must have been cancelled out by a decreased impact in other states.

<quote>
In short: McGentrix is considerably more right than BBB was. If with the "religious right" we mean those who attend religious service at least once a week and vote for Bush then McG is right: their numbers remained pretty much the same in 2000 and in 2004. In 2000, they made up 25% of all voters; in 2004, 26%. Same goes for the smaller group of those who attend religious service more often still and vote Republican, as we have seen: their share also grew by just one percent, from 9% to 10% of all voters. In absolutes, their numbers will have increased - but by hardly any more than the number of other (less religious) voters did. Turnout increased among both groups in similar fashion.

Does that mean the "religious right" didn't yield Bush the elections? Well, since Bush won by just a 3% margin, any group of over 3% of the electorate can of course be said to have yielded Bush the elections. But whatever role the religious right played in terms of numbers in 2004, it was no different, and no larger a role than it was in 2000.
</quote>

One could question, and I do, whether the measure of those who attend church once a week is a good enough measure of "devout." However that's not as important as the number of those who were convinced by the organizers from the FAR. Obviously they're not winning elections by their numbers alone. They have organized in such a way to mobilize non FAR voters. That's my point, after all. I'll try to read the article above and fill you in as soon as I can. Tonight, I have to work on something else.

I don't think it's a simple matter of numbers. It has to do with organized methods of influence. Who is paying the bill for such organizers and who is putting in all the hard work. Your emphasis on who is "right" and who is "wrong" is, I think, premature. Let's look at all the data and then make up our minds. It is, after all as easy to lie with numbers as it is to lie with words. Let's consider all the data.

Also nimh,

Debating which group won the election for Bush is beside the point. Obviously any group can be identified as the deciding group. But just as obviously, any group with decreased numbers could also have lost the election for Bush. How could one determine such a thing? I'm not trying to understand if the FAR won the election for Bush or any particular candidate for Congress. I'm talking about their influence beyond their own voter base.

Karl Rove and Paul Weyrich and others know this. Why don't we?

No, my emphasis on who was "right" and who was "wrong" here wasn't premature, since it referred to a very specific question - not the broader argument you bring up here.

I like to keep specific, concrete questions separately from the whole, holistic general argument of it all, myself, because it allows one to doublecheck each specific argument or assumption and either prove or negate it, so that henceforth, one's general theorizing can at least be based on assertions that are tested rather than merely asserted or speculated upon.

Ergo, I have no problems with exploring what influence the religious right may have organisationally or discourse-wise. It might well have a bigger impact or less big a one on either such planes - my post didn't concern itself with that. It referred spefically to this post of yours here:

<quote orig_author="Lola">
<quote orig_author="McGentrix">
If I recall, the numbers of the "religious right" that voted in 2000 and in 2004 remained pretty much the same. I wonder where this sudden idea that they would "reward him with their votes in record numbers." comes from.

McG,

Your claim contradicts the number BBB has posted (thanks BBB, excellent posts). Don't recall, show us where we can read these stats for ourselves.

BBB posted this article, I'm repeating the next to the last paragraph. Show us, McG, don't just tell.

<quote>
While election-day exit polling relied on vague terms like "moral values" to produce inconclusive evidence about conservative Christian voters (do only fundamentalists have moral values?), they did reveal that the rate of voters who attended church once a week leapt by 2 points from 2000 and that 64 percent of them voted for Bush. [..]
</quote>

</quote>

This is straightforward enough, Lola. McGentrix asserted that "the numbers of the 'religious right' that voted in 2000 and in 2004 remained pretty much the same" - and that the idea that they would "reward [Bush] with their votes in record numbers" thus seemed ill-founded. You replied that his "claim contradict[ed] the number BBB has posted" and, thanking BBB for her excellent posts, you quoted her purely on those election data.

Well, those data I could check - and basically, McGentrix was right. Of course you are welcome to "look at all the data" with us and point out what specific numbers might again disprove his point, if you want. You've got the links now. Just trying to get the specifics sorted here. You wouldn't want to go on claims that turn out to be unfounded, after all.

Here I am running into something of a meta-level problem. I mean, this happens a lot. Someone poses a general argument (say, the religious right is winning new influence), and as one of his/her supporting arguments, refers to the election data. Now the general argument is to some extent a question of opinion or perception, but those data one can check, as I did here. But when I then proceed to negate (or prove) the supporting argument in question, I often find the response to be: oh, well, but that wasnt what it was about anyway, its a much more general thing, you haven't at all mentioned (random other proposed supporting argument A, B or C). I mean, in this case you repeatedly told McG, "show us"; but when I then do "show" you, you revert to saying all of it is irrelevant anyway. It's quite frustrating, because this way it's quite hard to actually make any progress in researching the argument.

Thing is, to pull the general argument from a context of belief/perception, those supporting arguments do need to be tested and the result of that do need to be acknowledged and taken into account in whatever follow-up assertions are made. In the end, then, the pieces of proof will fall together - or fall apart. Call it a measure of academic rigor.

Now, the piece of proof concerning the supposed increased impact of churchgoing Bush voters on these elections just fell through. Thats OK - you or others might (have) come up with wholly other pieces of proof. But what I am wary of is the tendency to unquestioningly accept such numbers and use them as evidence when they still appear to prove your point, and the moment someone shows you how they actually say something quite different, dismiss them as irrelevant - premature, we dont have all the data, it doesnt say much, the measures are not right, any of such arguments. This tendency does tend to reinforce the impression that we are dealing with a question of belief here (which, as you'll agree, usually involves a selective willingness to integrate the results of fact-finding dependent on whether they square with the belief or not).

Anyway, no bother. If the participants to this thread refrain, henceforth, from making claims about some increased impact of regular churchgoers in the 2004 elections as part of their argument (or provide specifics to disprove my debunkation after all), then you are still free to argue your general point in any number of other ways - and find supporting arguments for those.

nimh,

I couldn't agree with you more on this statement and on everything you said after that. I didn't have the intention you assume from the quote you site, although I can see how you would interpret it that way. I was just trying to say to McG, " Don't recall, show us where we can read these stats for ourselves."

Let me just clarify what I'm attempting to study here, so we can go from there. I want to study the effect of the effort of the FAR to influence the American political process. My very point is that the FAR doesn't have the numbers to win an election alone. And it is this fact I'm emphasizing. What influence they are having beside their numbers is what I would like to define and understand.

Sorry if I was misleading in that.

Everything you've written above I agree with. But I would like to expand our field of enquiry. Sorry if I sounded rude or defensive.

I would like this thread to be as scholarly and as inclusive of all data as is possible.

Actually your statistics prove my point. The FAR does not have the numbers to win an election. They may have the numbers to lose an election. (This actually is a point they've made themselves several times.) So what are they doing beyond voting that is being influencial, if anything? I think what they're doing is significant. Let's see if we can decide if that's true and if so how.

And thanks for your participation.

<post author="blatham" datetime="2004-11-18T19:59:00" id="p88">
Let me make a point here.

Of the various discernible voting groups (african americans, latinos, women, etc) one is exceptional, and that is the socially conservative christian community.

Unlike any of the other voting 'blocks', they are extremely well organized and have been for at least two decades. Among women voters, for example, no comparable level of organization exists and nothing comes close.

Further, they are now a critical element within the Republican machine and have gained a degree of influence which no other group (aside from corporate) can boast.

Third, they have a well-established set of policy initiatives and goals in which they passionately believe. One couldn't make that claim about Latinos, for example.

Fourth, they constitute one of the most activist discernible groups.

Fifth, because of these factors above, they have become a source of power and influence far greater than simple polling totals suggest. Consider how powerful the National Socialists in Germany became though constituting a very small numerical proportion of the population.

The third party threat from Buchanan no longer realistically exists. Women don't constitute such a threat, nor do african americans nor Latinos. The third party threat from the christian social conservatives is, in contrast, very real.

The point is influence, not numbers.

Would this outpouring of an unexpected conservative vote relate to the "silent majority" that kept Nixon in office?

(Fellow Conservatives, sorry for the unfortunate comparison...)

The left were out in the streets, protesting the war...it looked like the whole world was against the incumbent. And, wasn't his win a bit of a surprise? It seemed then, and it does now, that the quiet, regular homefolk who don't do a lot of street marching and such--didn't like the way things looked on the left.

I don't buy the "sinister backroom plotting of Christians" scenario. (Not that it didn't happen, but that it could be that effective.)

The quiet, regular above-average income earners, yes, they apparently in majority didnt... The quiet, regular homefolk earning up to $50,000 liked the left fine, apparently, by the same standard... after all, they in majority voted for Kerry.

&lt;nods at Lola's gracious reply and pledges to keep more to the topic of the thread&gt;

OK, one more sidenote still, re: Blatham - the National Socialists unfortunately constituted a bit more than "a very small numerical proportion of the population"... In the elections before the last free ones, they received some 42% of the vote, I believe (and they lost only a bit of that again in the very last ones).

The subject of this thread is the effect of the FAR on American politics.
</quote>

In this case, it may be a good idea if each of us stated what [s]he thinks this effect is. From reading the first nine pages of this thread, I get the impression that everyone is trying to post evidence, without telling the others what they think they're posting evidence of. &lt;nods to blatham, who did explicitly state his opinion.&gt; Anyway, here is what I consider to be the most prominent effects of the religious right on American politics.

(1) Some of their spokespeople have come into influential positions in government. The most prominent example seems to be Tom DeLay, who is on record as stating that his mission in the Senate is to promote "a biblical world view", and that the Columbine High School massacre was caused in part by public schools teaching evolution.

(2) For some of the issues it cares strongly about, the religious right has been successful at making them part of the public debate, and it has forged coalitions with other social groups at pushing legislation on them. The best example is its campaign against homosexual marriage, which has broad support among both moderate Republicans and Democrats. Other issues, where support isn't quite as broad, include their support for constitutional originalist at the Supreme Court, abstinence-only programs against AIDS, and limits to sexual education at public schools. They have been fairly un successful, though not completely so, on issues where they don't have broad support, such as limits to the teaching of evolution.

(3) For the most part, I believe the political mainstream has had a much stronger influence on the religious right than vice versa. My favorite test case for this is the Washington Times. It's founder and owner, the Reverend Sun Myung Moon, is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61932-2004Jun22.html">a cult leader and a Christian extremist</a> if there ever was one. <a href="http://www.unification.net/1997/970616.html">By his own account</a>, he founded the Washington Times "to fulfill God's desperate desire to save this world. Since that time [ 1982, T. ], I have devoted myself to raising up The Washington Times, hoping that this blessed land of America would fulfill its world-wide mission to build a Heavenly nation."

But his publication, <a href="http://www.washtimes.com">judging by its website</a>, is neither especially cultish or even especiallly religious at all. It has its oddities and blind spots just like any paper has, but basically it's just another normal, conservative newspaper. This isn't happening because Moon is such a fair-minded publisher. It's because he knows that nobody will read his paper if he makes his agenda its agenda, and that he can't affect public opinion if nobody reads his paper. From observing the tradeoff Moon chose between editorial zeal and reader attention, I conclude that the center of American politics is holding up quite nicely, and that the effect of right-wing zealots is probably overstated by their opponents.

Okay, I have stated my opinion, and why I believe it's correct. I expect lots of people to jump on me for it, and that's okay with me, but I would appreciate it if you stated your opinion first before you start the jumping.

Thanks!

<post author="Lola" datetime="2004-11-19T14:46:00" id="p92">
Thomas,

The following is a statement about what I believe the effect of the FAR on American politics.

1. During the eighties, leaders of the FAR (Ralph Reed, Weyrich, Rove, Falwell, Robertson, LeHaye, Dobson and others) developed a plan to take control of the Republican Party for the purpose of establishing a theocratic government in the U.S.

Their method developed over a period of a few years, but ultimately it included methods such as:

A. To put up candidates who ran without declaring their true intentions. They started on a local level with local school boards. For instance, a candidate for a local school board would run based on a general, innocuous platform (I want schools to be accountable for quality of education, I have more experience than the incumbent because I've been an attorney or an accountant or a professional for so and so years. This came complete with a photo of the candidate and his family all smiling and apparently happy, clean cut and wholesome. They, on purpose, did not mention that they wanted to influence the choice of public school textbooks. Or that they wanted those textbooks to include "creationism" as a legitimate form of science.

B. To take over the Republican convention by winning election for party delegates, again without identifying their ultimate intentions. It was easy to be chosen as a delegate because this position is a lot of work and most sane people have better things to do with their time. So when an energetic person wants the job, it's easy to get it.

C. The FAR has raised huge amounts of money, using their churches as fund raising arms.

D. The New Right has spawned innumerable political action organizations for the purpose of making it easy for their readership to contact their lawmakers about objections to legislation opposed to the FAR political agenda. Some of these include:

The Triumphs of the New Right
By Frances FitzGerald
Richard Viguerie
(click for larger image)
The New Right: We're Ready to Lead
by Richard A. Viguerie, introduction by Jerry Falwell

The Sweetheart of the Silent Majority: The Biography of Phyllis Schlafly
by Carol Felsenthal

Just after the 1980 election the ABC show called "Nightline" put the satellite technology of television to work to create an extraordinary electronic encounter between Senator George McGovern, Senator Frank Church, Senator Birch Bayh, Jerry Falwell, and Paul Weyrich. The three just-defeated senators had never met their opponents before, and the two sides knew so little about each other that both were disarmed. Instead of the usual political fencing match the debate was a raw, emotional confrontation.

One of the strange things about the debate was the apparent imbalance of the two sides. Three leaders of the Democratic party with long careers in public office were pitted against a fundamentalist minister and an almost unknown political organizer. Yet as organizers for the New Right, Weyrich and Falwell represented a coalition that had raised more money for the 1980 election than the entire Democratic party nationally.

After that election, the New Right organizers could claim that they had helped to elect over two dozen senators and a great many more congressmen, who generally could be counted on to oppose the Supreme Court decisions on busing, school prayer, and abortion, as well as to support Reagan's economic and defense policies. "Nightline" did not invite any of the new senators to meet McGovern, Church, and Bayh, for good reason: the New Right was not created by politicians but by organizers.
</quote>

I can't direct you to the entire article because it's in the archives of the NYRB and is available by subscription only. When I have the chance, I'll read it and post some key points from it.

2. Through grass roots organizing, the FAR or the New Right eventually took over the Texas Republican party a decade ago and elected George Bush governor. They have since taken over the entire state and propelled Bush (one of their own) to the presidency and another to leadership of the House of Representatives (Tom DeLay).

For an example of the extremism involved, here's a sample from the Texas Republican Platform of 2000. (Later platforms were refined and their naked intentions were better disguised.)

<quote>
2000 Texas GOP Platform :
The Party calls for the United States monetary system to be returned to the gold standard. Since the Federal Reserve System is a private corporation, has no reserves, and is not subject to taxation or audit, we call on Congress to abolish this institution and reassume its authority, enumerated by Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, for the coinage of money.

Short Translation :
The United States should return to the gold standard and abolish the Federal Reserve.

2000 Texas GOP Platform :
Congress should be urged to exercise its authority under Article III, Sections 1 and 2 of the United States Constitution, and should withhold appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in such cases involving abortion, religious freedom, and all rights guaranteed under the Bill of Rights.

Short translation :
The Supreme Court should not be allowed to decide the constitutionality of laws regarding abortion, religion, or anything else related to the Bill of Rights. In these areas, Congress should be allowed to pass any laws it wishes.

2000 Texas GOP Platform :
Our Party pledges to do everything within its power to restore the original intent of the First Amendment of the United States and the concept of the separation of Church and State and dispel the myth of the separation of Church and State.

Short translation :
We should completely do away with separation of church and state.

2000 Texas GOP Platform :
The party opposes the decriminalization of sodomy....We publicly rebuke judges Chief Justice Murphy and John Anderson, who ruled that the 100 year-old Texas sodomy law is unconstitutional, and ask that all members of the Republican Party of Texas oppose their re-election.

Translation :
Gay sex should be a criminal offense.

2000 GOP Platform :
The Party affirms its support for a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse making clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protection applies to unborn children.

Translation :
All abortion of all kinds should be permanently outlawed by constitutional amendment.

Platform :
No homosexual or any individual convicted of child abuse or molestation should have the right to custody or adoption of a minor child, and that visitation with minor children by such persons should be limited to supervised periods.

Translation :
Gays should be treated like child molesters and should not be allowed to visit children unsupervised.

Platform :
The Party believes that scientific topics, such as the question of universe and life origins and environmental theories, should not be constrained to one opinion or viewpoint. We support the teaching equally of scientific strengths and weaknesses of all scientific theories--as Texas now requires (but has yet to enforce) in public school science course standards. We urge revising all environmental education standards to require this also. We support individual teachers' right to teach creation science in Texas public schools.

Translation :
The Biblical story of creation should be taught in science classes.

Platform :
The Party supports an orderly transition to a system of private pensions based on the concept of individual retirement accounts, and gradually phasing out the Social Security tax.

Translation :
Social Security should be abolished.

Platform :
We urge that the IRS be abolished and the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution be repealed. A constitutional tax, collected and controlled by the States, must generate sufficient revenue for the legitimate tasks of the national government.

Translation :
The federal income tax should be abolished.

Platform :
The Party believes the minimum wage law should be repealed.

Translation :
The federal minimum wage should be abolished.

Platform :
We further support the abolition of federal agencies involved in activities not delegated to the federal government under the original intent of the Constitution including, but not limited to, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the position of Surgeon General, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Departments of Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Education, Commerce and Labor.

translation :
The EPA, HUD, HHS, the Department of Education, and several other federal agencies should be eliminated. Since these departments supervise all federal welfare programs for the poor and sick, they are presumably advocating the complete abolishment of the federal welfare state.

Platform :
The Party believes it is in the best interest of the citizens of the United States that we immediately rescind our membership in, as well as all financial and military contributions to, the United Nations.

Translation :
Get the United States out of the UN.

Platform :
The Party urges Congress to support HJR 77, the Panama and America Security Act, which declare the Carter-Torrijos Treaty null and void. We support re-establishing United States control over the Canal in order to retain our military bases in Panama, to preserve our right to transit through the Canal, and to prevent the establishment of Chinese missile bases in Panama.

Translation :
Take back the Panama Canal.

(This plank remains in the 2002 platform. Since Panama presumably would object to this, they appear to be endorsing military action to retake the canal zone.)

Platform :
Any person filing as a Republican candidate for a public or Party office shall be provided a current copy of the Party platform at the time of filing. The candidate shall be asked to read and initial each page of the platform and sign a statement affirming he/she has read the entire platform.

Translation :
We are dead serious about this.

Does this sound like a small victory to you? Not to me. Nor does it sound like "the effect of right-wing zealots is probably overstated by their opponents."

P.S. Your favorite example is no example at all of the New Right. Rev. Moon is considered by the FAR to be a cult leader, a heretic and an embarrassment.

Here are quotations from the article to which you posted a link:

<quote>
Among the more than 300 people who attended all or part of the March ceremony was Sen. Mark Dayton (D-Minn.), who now says he simply was honoring a constituent receiving a peace award and did not know Moon would be there. "We fell victim to it; we were duped," Dayton spokeswoman Chris Lisi said yesterday.

Other lawmakers who attended or were listed as hosts felt the same, she said. "Everyone I talked to was furious," she said. With Minnesotans demanding to know whether Dayton is a follower of Moon, Lisi said, the senator persuaded the St. Paul Pioneer Press to write an article allowing him to reply.

The event's organizers flew in nearly 100 honorees from all 50 states to receive state and national peace awards. The only "international crown of peace awards" went to Moon and his wife.

Some Republicans who attended the event, including Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett (Md.), said they did so mainly to salute the Washington Times, a conservative-leaning newspaper owned by Moon's organization. "I had no idea what would happen" regarding Moon's coronation and speech, Bartlett said yesterday.

<quote>
Use of the Dirksen building requires a senator's approval. Dayton said he gave no such permission, and Stallings said the question of who did so is "shrouded in mystery."

More choice bits [from the 2000 Texas Platform]:

Aside from the obligatory nods to states rights, opposition to the surrender of US troop sovereignty under UN or NATO, elimination of the ATF, a reference to the ERA amendment, voter registration restrictions, English-only legislation, and an exhortation of "LET'S ROLL!" in the WoT.

OK, one more sidenote still, re: Blatham - the National Socialists unfortunately constituted a bit more than "a very small numerical proportion of the population"... In the elections before the last free ones, they received some 42% of the vote, I believe (and they lost only a bit of that again in the very last ones).

You've missed the entire point of my post. Likely my fault. I wasn't defining 'national socialists' as those who voted for them, but rather as the individuals who constituted the well-oiled organizational machine, the brown-shirt and SS militias, and the central coterie of leaders under Hitler.

These people constituted a very small segment of the population, but exerted an influence on the direction of German politics that we're all aware of.

Secular Conservative Philanthropies waging unethical campaign to take over United Methodist Church

by Andrew J. Weaver and Nicole Seibert
for Mediatransparency.org

POSTED AUGUST 2, 2004 --

The United Methodist and other mainline Protestant churches are the targets of a continuing, orchestrated attack by determined right-wing ideologues who use CIA-style propaganda methods to sow dissention and distrust, all in pursuit of a radical political agenda.

The leader of this attack is an organization called the Institute on Religion and Democracy (IRD), a pseudo-religious think-tank that carries out the goals of its secular funders that are opposed to the churches' historic social witness.

The IRD works in concert with other self-styled "renewal" groups like Good News and the Confessing Movement. IRD answers only to its own self-perpetuating board of directors, most of whom are embedded in the secular political right (Howell, 1995).

In the January/February 2004 issue of Zion's Herald, we published a special report on the activities of the IRD. We documented how it is primarily funded by right-wing secular foundations.

Yes, I did say it was a sidenote I was making, not a response to your central argument. But still, this does bring up a relevant point, I believe. The National Socialists and their militias (not so small in number) did succeed in acquiring and exercising a decisive influence on the direction Germany was to take not just by their "well-oiled organizational machine". For all the machine they might have built, they wouldnt have succeeded if they hadnt in fact managed to persuade such an huge minority of Germans to give them the benefit of the doubt or outright start believing in them. And I don't believe that a well-oiled machine in itself is enough to ensure such a success - which may explain part of our disagreement about the potential harm the religious right is about to cause.

The Nazis succeeded because they managed to play off themes and prejudices that resounded with a near-majority of Germans, and they managed to do so because of the situation the specific drastic turnabouts of the time (economic crisis etc) had created. I do not see a similar potential for the religious right to exploit in America at this time - there is currently no 43% that can be pulled into Jerry Falwell's dark side, and if the existential insecurity created by 9/11 did not create it, then I don't see anything else creating it soon after all.

Negotiators Add Abortion Clause to Spending Bill
By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and CARL HULSE

Published: November 20, 2004

ASHINGTON, Saturday, Nov. 20 - House and Senate negotiators have tucked a potentially far-reaching anti-abortion provision into a $388 billion must-pass spending bill, complicating plans for Congress to wrap up its business and adjourn for the year.

The provision may be an early indication of the growing political muscle of social conservatives who provided crucial support for Republican candidates, including President Bush, in the election.

House officials said Saturday morning that the final details of the spending measure were worked out before midnight and that the bill was filed for the House vote on Saturday.

The abortion language would bar federal, state and local agencies from withholding taxpayer money from health care providers that refuse to provide or pay for abortions or refuse to offer abortion counseling or referrals. Current federal law, aimed at protecting Roman Catholic doctors, provides such "conscience protection'' to doctors who do not want to undergo abortion training. The new language would expand that protection to all health care providers, including hospitals, doctors, clinics and insurers.

I can see how this would seem logical to you, Thomas. Some of the local school boards did manage to get rid of the imposters in the next election after they were elected. However, most did not. The voters remain ignorant about the day to day functioning of the school boards and the Republican Party Delegates to the Convention. American voters are easy to dupe. There are many who just want to believe......... it's so easy. And maybe you haven't heard about the gerrymandering that went on in Texas and Colorado last year? Tom DeLay actually succeeded in his effort to insure the re-election and maintainance of Texas Republican FAR elected officials.

BTW, did you know that Bush won Dallas county by only a one percent margin? 49% Kerry, 51% Bush. The 49% are the folks in South Dallas and the liberals in East Dallas. But the precinct maps make it almost impossible for a Republican to win in Texas ever again.

I knew you were going to say this. I don't claim there's anything wrong with political action organizations. But the question is, "how has the FAR influenced the American political scene?" And this is one of the ways they have done it. I personally think the FAR is more advanced in this particular political tactic than are the Democrats. Hopefully the liberals will get as good at this as the FAR is already. Some of the liberal political action this election was good and continues to improve, even rising to the level of near excellence. I'm hopeful about this aspect of the Democratic machine.

So then, Thomas, you're saying, given that these very militant fanatics have taken over the Texas Republican party and have written a platform advocating these extreme positions.

A few fascist fanatics here and there are harmless. Most of them don't really believe that stuff anyway, and the Republicans are just compromising with them on a few minor issues.

But you don't have to take my word for any of this. Just keep an open mind and hang around.

No. I am saying that their influence is limited as people will eventually vote on their record, and they don't like the lion's share of that record. Unfortunately, people like some of their record. For example, much of their anti-gay agenda will pass because a broad majority of Americans supports some of it. But overall, the New Right's success at pushing its agenda will be limited. For example, it would be interesting for me to see how much of their agenda they have implemented in Texas since George Bush became governor.

Bono's New Casualty: 'Private Ryan'

Published: November 21, 2004 New York Times

As American soldiers were dying in Falluja, some Americans back home spent Veteran's Day mocking the very ideal our armed forces are fighting for freedom. Ludicrous as it sounds, 66 ABC affiliates revolted against their own network and refused to broadcast "Saving Private Ryan." The reason: fear. Not fear of terrorism or fear of low ratings but fear that their own government would punish them for exercising freedom of speech.

Give Nixon credit for George W's 2004 election victory
You have to credit Richard Nixon for George W. Bush's election victory in 2004.

During Richard Nixon's first successful campaign for the presidency in 1968, he went around the country making very militant speeches attacking the Warren Court, especially some of the criminal justice decisions. He railed against the forces of peace and the forces of crime that were in war against each other. The Warren Court, he claimed, preferred the criminals and not the tax-paying, God-fearing, law-abiding people of America.

Nixon's pitch was fairly simple. He said that if you elected him president, he would nominate a very different kind of justice of the court. He would have judicial conservatives on the court and not this liberal crowd of Warren Court activists anymore. Nixon was elected and it was a close election and then history played into his hands.

Justices are on the court for life and good behavior. Some of them hang around for a very long time. There have been 109 justices in the over two centuries of American history. That means that, if they retired evenly, there would be a vacancy about every two years. But court vacancies tend to bunch. For example, Jimmy Carter was president for four years and there were no vacancies.

On the other hand, when Nixon was elected as president, in the first term of Nixon's presidency, there were four vacancies. One short of a majority on the court. The country was on the edge of their chairs waiting to see what Nixon would do.

Nixon started off with what he called his "Southern Strategy" to lock-up southern votes in the next presidential election. So he appointed Clemon Hainsworth, a very eminent justice from the fourth circuit who was defeated. Then he reached even further into the bottom of the barrel and nominated G. Harold Carswell, who was not fit to be on the lower bench, much less on the U.S. Supreme Court. His nomination was defeated.

But Nixon's two nominations of Southerners, whose nominations he knew would fail but would inflame conservative voters, succeeded beyond his highest hopes. Nixon's "Southern Strategy" prevailed and Southern voters abandoned the Democracts and became and voted Republican---then and since.

In case you doubt it, review the locations of the Red and Blue states on the Electoral College Map. Then look back at the Electoral College maps of the states prior to and after the Civil War. Slavery and States Rights shaped those maps. The new States Rights issue is the separation of Church and State, which is not defined in the Constitution nor in the Bill of Rights.

Then comes the RAFs, the subject of this thread.
--------------------------------------------------

Just What Was Nixon's Southern Strategy
Liberal Politics: U.S. Blog
January 02, 2004

Howard Dean's controversial remark about his desire to appeal to white Southerners with Confederate flag decals on their trucks has put Nixon's "Southern Strategy" in the spotlight some 36 years after it was first articulated.

But just what is the Southern Strategy and how has it helped Republicans to erode Democratic support in the South.

In a Los Angeles Times commentary, author Mark Kurlansky says this about Nixon and the Southern Strategy:

"In discussing the campaign ahead, Howard Dean has said on several occasions now that the Republicans will "do what they've been doing since 1968." But what exactly is that? As far as I can tell, what they've been doing is winning presidential elections. They have won six of the last nine if you count the last one that they did not exactly win.
Of course, that's not exactly what Dean meant. He meant that for him to win in 2004 he has to defeat a system established in 1968 by Richard M. Nixon. Never one to mince words, Dean has described that system as one of "coded racism." And its key code phrase was "states' rights," an old Southern favorite going back to the right to own slaves.

Nixon, always known more as an opportunist than an ideologue, assessed the political landscape when he ran for president in 1968, a time when Republicans had lost every presidential election since the Depression, except for two by Dwight D. Eisenhower. Like Dean today, he asked why are we losing and how can that be changed?

Nixon saw his opportunity in the decline of the great civil rights movement and the killing of Martin Luther King Jr. He judged that the South, a solid Democratic bloc that had never forgiven Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans for the Emancipation Proclamation, was furious about 10 years of civil rights progress and was ready to turn on the Democrats, who had received faithful Southern support since before the Civil War. In the end, Nixon defeated the Democrats not because of their worst disaster, Vietnam, but because of their greatest accomplishment, civil rights."

Noted firebrand Pat Buchanan adds some interesting commentary to the debate from an article he wrote in 2002. He criticizes neoconservatives for claiming that the Southern Strategy was based on race. Buchanan writes in The American Cause:

"The charge that we built our Republican coalition on race is a lie. Nixon routed the left because it had shown itself incompetent to win or end a war into which it had plunged the United States and too befuddled or cowardly to denounce the rioters burning our cities or the brats rampaging on our campuses.

Nixon led America out of a dismal decade and was rewarded with a 49-state landslide. By one estimate, he carried 18 percent of the black vote in 1972 and 25 percent in the South. No Republican has since matched that. To see Kristol colluding with the Times to rewrite that history to make liberals heroes and Republicans villains tells us more about him than about the era.

And where were the necons, when Goldwaterites and Nixonites were building the New Majority? Going all the way with LBJ."

On this we agree. I was saying this before the election over the last year. Many of my friends considered me to be naive. Unfortunately I had to agree with them that they were right. I guess I was too hopeful for this election. What you and I may disagree about is how much harm the New Right will do before the voters recognize what is going on. How much harm will be necessary before the press will finally begin to focus on it. From the looks of what's happened in the last two weeks, it won't be long. However, in two years how well will the voters remember? How far will they have to inch up on us before the voters and press finally notice the distance travelled?

I'm not one who believes the problem is voter idiocy. I believe the problem is voter ignorance. And it's our task to answer our own questions about what's taking place and bring the current abuses into the light of day.

<quote>
For example, it would be interesting for me to see how much of their agenda they have implemented in Texas since George Bush became governor.

The outrageous goals contained in the 2000 Texas Platform were national issues. Obviously they couldn't be implemented in Texas. But observe who is president. George Bush. Who is House majority leader? Tom DeLay. How many New Right Congressmen do we have? An alarming number. And in the last two weeks we've seen them at work.

There are obviously varying degrees of fanatical fascism. But fanaticism is fanaticism and fascism is fascism. Because they are less fanatically fascist than the Nazis makes them not fascist? That's a huge mark. They're now simply a really really really bad president, a dangerous ideologue and an effective smearmaster? It's true the world was turned upside down by the Nazis and we all suffered, some of us more than others.

I think he has tendencies, but I'm more worried by the people around him. Remember, America is not likely to replicate the European experience. It is a different place and a different time. What you have to look for is the underlying similarities such as manipulation of fear, a following the feels its self under siege from overwhelming outside forces of change, claims of an insidious but hidden enemy,, hyper nationalism, economic program that favors cooperations, and an intolerance and demonization of the opposition.

More than willing to discuss the subject Lola - I checked in to the thread in response to your invitation with just such a discussion in mind. However not on the terms established here.

I mean no personal offense to you or anyone here Lola, however those are my views of the situation, and I believe those thoughts needed expression.. We disagree, but we are still friends - as far as I am concerned.

george,

We are most certainly still friends as far as I'm concerned too. However I must respond more fully to your post. Ovr the last year or so, you have had three responses to my attempts to write about or study this subject. The first one is:

"You have an irrational hatred for Christians. You don't understand that all Christians are not fanatics."

2. "You're over reacting. There aren't that many of them. Don't worry, it'll be ok."

3. "The liberals are just as bad."

What I've asked you to do is put aside the first two objections and to look at the phenomenon with as open a mind as you can. You've said yourself that you don't like these fanatical Christians. And as for your third objection, it has nothing to do with the subject. Whether there are others just as bad or not is not the question.

I agree there are fanatics on both sides. But your fanatics are highly organized and moving in. That's the difference. But even if the liberal fanatics were as organized as the Right Wing are, wouldn't you want to look at both groups separately to understand their differences and similarities? To understand the dangers in both camps?

If we do what you want to do, we won't be looking at the New Right anymore. We'll be arguing about who is worse. I don't object at all if you want to start a thread about the liberals, what ever aspect of them you want to understand. I'll join you there and we can look at that. And I promise you that every work off my keyboard will not be, "oh yeah, well what about you?" or "you just don't like liberals."

I'm not calling you a bigot even though by your criteria I could. "Oh yeah, well you're a bigot too."" How far would we get with that?

I see that you're reluctant to look at the New Right as a subject for scrutiny, i.e., who are they, what do they believe, how well organized are they, what are their goals, how close are they to achieving their goals, how dangerous to our democracy are they? You don't have to participate on this thread. I just thought you might be willing to give it a try. But if not, then I'll love you anyway.

I consider it most unlikely that George Bush is capable of being a fascist, I don't think he cares that much about anything but his fragile self image. It's the machine that uses and supports George Bush I see as so dangerous.

They're not my fanatics

I see little to distinguish the conflicting groups in terms of the degrees to which they are organized.

Like the poles in a magnet, these polarizing influences cannot be meaningfully analyzed separately - they are defined by their conflict. The choice to "analyze" one or the other implicitly involves choice - and a distortion of the analysis.

Who can resist that? Always a sucker for mermaids. Here is a post of mine from another thread that further explains my views - the context there was how the Democrat party might rebound from their recent defeat. Thomas has just pointed out that the gulf between religious people and the so called 'progressive' wing of American politics was of recent origin and could conceivably be eliminated,

"Thomas' proposition that the social policies advocated by most Christian churches, and, more importantly, many of the essential beliefs of Christianity, are entirely consistent with many of the historical views of the Democrat party, is accurate to a point. It is also true that the Republican Party's creation and initial growth was closely associated with a largely Christian Abolitionist movement in the Northern states. Overall the historical and contemporary associations are decidedly mixed.

Unfortunately over the last several decades a handful of social/political issues have seriously polarized the body politic on both sides of this issue. The Democrat 'progressive' elements in our society have morphed from active participation of religious groups to something quite irreligious and finally to something rather anti-religious in both content and prevailing attitudes. Unfortunately at the same time the self-proclaimed spokesmen of 'religious' views have more and more come to represent only a segment of the spectrum, an uncompromising fundamentalist, evangelical segment of Protestantism. All this was happening amidst a general decline in the practice of religion by Americans - perhaps not to the degree found in Europe, but significant nonetheless. Moreover the Catholic Church hierarchy was rather thoroughly (and justifiably) discredited by a long tolerance of abuses, mostly of teenage boys by homosexual priests. As often happens in such polarized circumstances a perverse application of Gresham's law of currency takes hold -- radical, intolerant, uncompromising attitudes on both sides drive out more sensible, moderate ones. "

Intolerance, ignorance and prejudice are more or less the same at both ends of the spectrum. I see no merit in joining either side.

The 14 Defining
Characteristics Of Fascism
by Dr. Lawrence Britt

Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes. Britt found 14-defining characteristics common to each:

1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism -
Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays. TOP

2. Disdain for
the Recognition of Human Rights -
Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of "need." The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. TOP

3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats
as a Unifying Cause -
The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. TOP

4. Supremacy of the Military -
Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. TOP

5. Rampant Sexism -
The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution. TOP

6. Controlled Mass Media -
Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common. TOP

7. Obsession with National Security -
Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. TOP

8. Religion and Government are Intertwined -
Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions. TOP

9. Corporate Power is Protected -
The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite. TOP

10. Labor Power is Suppressed -
Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed. TOP

11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts -
Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked. TOP

12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment -
Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.

13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption -
Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. TOP

14. Fraudulent Elections -
Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections. TOP

________________________________

An interesting note to end this article: As of January 2004, the United States fulfills all fourteen points of fascism and all seven warning signs are present. But we're not alone. Israel also fulfills all fourteen points and all seven warning signs as well. Welcome to the new republic, redefined, revised and spun. It is not too late to reverse this in either country, but it will be soon. The first step is realizing it. The second step is getting involved. As the propaganda slogan disguising our current war goes, "Freedom isn't free." But our war for freedom isn't abroad; it's here at home.

<quote>
To control a population's opinion, those driving any agenda need only control directly or through influence 25% of the media, education, cultural sources like film, books and music and other sources of accredited information. For example, Rupert Murdoch, (News Corp: FOX, 20th Century FOX, TV Guide, New York Post and others) at this time controls all satellite transmissions to the world's media except one. If the FCC rulings proceed without reversal and Murdoch is allowed to buy this last line of satellite transmission, he will own them all. The consequences of one man controlling 100% of all satellite news media transmissions and 100% of the news distributed by this vehicle worldwide are yet to be determined; yet such power over the information available cannot be ignored and News Corps' properties continue to gain in influence and importance as evident by the current war in Iraq and the US's new sights on Iran.

The complexity of propaganda's entrenchment unfolds as those whom normally wouldn't support the agenda, become its advocates and defenders based upon the information they receive. A conspiracy is not necessary; the majority become the unknowing administrators. Propaganda becomes self-fulfilling.

If you would settle down, george and look, you'd see that the New Right is highly and effectively organized. They are ahead in organization by 20 years. Liberals were caught not watching. And for years we've been ignoring an increasingly difficult problem. If only the liberals were as organized we might be more effective in counteracting the extremism of the New Right. At the moment, we're still catching our breath and recognizing the dangers for what they are.

I have no quarrel with the fundamentalists of any religion as long as they are not trying to control me. They can believe as they want, and live as they want. But this is the problem. No liberal organization is trying to force others to live or believe in a certain way. The New Right is only concerned with control.

Faith-Based Parks?
Creationists meet the Grand Canyon

Wednesday, Nov. 17, 2004
At a park called Dinosaur Adventure Land, run by creationists near Pensacola, Florida, visitors are informed that man coexisted with dinosaurs. This fantasy accommodates the creationists' view that the Earth is only 6,000 years old and that Darwin's theory of evolution is false. Among the park exhibits is one that illustrates another creationist article of faith. It consists of a long trough filled with sand and fitted at one end with a water spigot. Above the trough is a sign reading "That River Didn't Make That Canyon." When visitors open the spigot, the water quickly cuts a gully through the sand, supposedly demonstrating how the Grand Canyon was created, practically overnight, by Noah's flood. That's nonsense, of course, but what else would you expect at a creationist park? Certainly, one might think, this couldn't be acceptable at, say, a National Park, right? Think again.

Two-thirds of the way across the continent, some four million people annually visit Grand Canyon National Park, marveling at the awesome view. In National Park Service (NPS) affiliated bookstores, they can find literature informing them that the great chasm runs for 277 miles along the bed of the Colorado River. It descends more than a mile into the earth, and along one stretch, is some 18 miles wide, its walls displaying impressive layers of limestone, sandstone, shale, schist and granite.

And, oh yes, it was formed about 4,500 years ago, a direct consequence of Noah's Flood. How's that? Yes, this is the ill-informed premise of "Grand Canyon, a Different View," a handsomely-illustrated volume also on sale at the bookstores. It includes the writings of creationists and creation scientists and was compiled by Tom Vail, who with his wife operates Canyon Ministries, conducting creationist-view tours of the canyon. "For years," Vail explains, "as a Colorado River guide, I told people how the Grand Canyon was formed over the evolutionary time span of millions of years. (Most geologists place the canyon's age at some six million years). Then I met the Lord. Now I have a different view of the Canyon, which according to a biblical time scale, can't possibly be more than a few thousand years old."

Vail's book attracted little notice when it first appeared in the NPS stores in 2003, until a critical review by Wilfred Elders, a respected University of California geologist, brought it to light and took apart its pseudoscientific claims. That led David Shaver, who heads the Geologic Resources Division of the Park Service, to send a memo to headquarters urging that the book be removed from the NPS stores. "It is not based on science," he wrote, " but on a specific religious doctrineand should not have been approved for in NPS affiliated book stores."

The presidents of The American Geological Institute and six of its member societies also weighed in, expressing their dismay to the Park Service. Noting that the Grand Canyon "provides a remarkable and unique opportunity to educate the public about Earth science," the scientists urged that, "in fairness to the millions of park visitors, we must clearly distinguish religious from scientific knowledge."

But when Grand Canyon National Park superintendent Joe Alston attempted to block the sale of Vail's book at canyon bookstores, he was overruled by NPS headquarters, which announced that a high-level policy review of the matter would be launched and a decision made by February, 2004. So far, no official decision has been announced.

Even worse, according to the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), an organization that includes many Park employees, papers obtained under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that no review has ever taken place. Indeed, PEER claims that the Bush Administration has already decided it will stand by its approval for the book and that hundreds more have been ordered. "Now that the book has become quite popular," explained an NPS flack to a Baptist news agency, "we don't want to remove it."

Even more troubling, PEER charges that Grand Canyon National Park no longer offers an official estimate of the age of the canyon, and that the NPS has blocked publication of guidance intended for park rangers that reminds them there is no scientific basis for creationism. The group has been increasingly concerned about what it calls the Park Service's "Faith-Based Parks" and the agency's seeming indifference to the separation of church and state Among other moves, for example, NPS has allowed the placing of bronze plaques bearing Psalm verses at Grand Canyon overlooks. PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch is indignant, "If the Bush Administration is using public resources for pandering to Christian fundamentalists, it should at least have the decency to tell the truth about it."

Is this religious bias, as some creationists charge? Hardly. It's more than likely that the majority of scientists, environmentalists and others protesting the NPS stand are themselves intelligent, rational Christians who are convinced by overwhelming evidence that the Grand Canyon is no Johnny-Come-Lately. The creationists have demonstrated again that they are scientifically illiterate, and out of step with the 21st century.

Perhaps the esteemed Doctor Britt will be kind enough to provide us with his list of the 14 distinguishing characteristics of horseshit. However, I dooubt that will improve our ability to detect the substance.

However, labels are beside the point. Bad guys are bad guys by whatever name.

Just a note. When I tell the guys who have had the privilege of being on the inside of some of these New Right organizations that some of the members of this forum don't believe how well they're organized and how effective they've become.......they laugh spontaneously, out loud. Of course, I don't tell them I think they're fascists. They wouldn't understand the metaphor. Now that I think of it.......... horse$h!t bad guys......... I think they might get that one.

Why is fascism such an elusive object of inquiry? As Robert Paxton notes at the outset of his study ('The Anatomy of Fascism', Knopf), the image of fascism has a deceptive clarity:
"Everyone is sure they know what fascism is. The most self-consciously
visual of all political forms, fascism presents itself to us in vivid
primary images: a chauvinist demagogue haranguing an ecstatic
crowd, disciplined ranks of marching youths, colored-shirted mil-
itants beating up members of some demonized minority..."

But it has proved uncommonly hard to define the nature of fascism, to determine how widely the notion can usefully be applied, or what differentiates it from other political movements and regimes...

Of course, there are differences of degrees between anything happening in America and that which happened under Hitler or Mussolini. Large enough to be differences of kind? There one has the definitional problem noted above. And another potential problem too, that of categorization in black and white such that a sapling is seen to be quite other than an oak tree. Let's note too that Italy and Germany were not at all identical.

<quote>
Military dictatorships and authoritarian monarchies were not an invention of the 20th century. But fascism was something else, something new and disquieting in its ability to mobilze enthusiasm and dedication, a form of modern mass politics....

Fascism, like the nationalism from which it sprang, exalted the primacy of the particular -- national or racial -- over the universal. So while communist movements could refer to a common body of dogma, however modified in practice by local circumstances, fascism appealed to different national myths, traditions, and prejudices...
the appeal to a primordial source of national being and values, endangered by the disruptive forces of moral individualism, pluralist democracy, and international capitalism, was a common and central feature of all kinds of authentic fascism, although it is not necessarily enough to distinguish it from earlier forms of nationalism...
the peculiar virulence of the fascist assault on the "internal enemy" derived from the fear of national disintegration...
Paxton is perhaps unduly limited in his approach by his thesis that fascism can only flourish where it has a democracy to fight. This leads him to the paradoxical, though not unsupported, conclusion that the only two states outside Europe where fascism is to be feared today are the United States and Israel...
(final paragraph) Hunting after instances of fascist revivals or attributing fascist characteristics to right-wing movements which go by another name can be a fruitless and paranoid exercise. The recent growth in movements of the radical right in Europe is more alarming as an index of impartience with conventional party politics and of urban degradation and anti-immigrant feeling than really dangerous, except in particular localities. Robert Paxton's book should help us to be sane and flexible, but also vigilant, in recognizing threats to democracy.
</quote>

What political term makes the best fit with the present US government is something time and historical research will tell us...Nixonian, totalitarian-light, whatever.

But one has to be a bit credulous, or nationalistically blind, or perhaps just overly hopeful to avoid recognition of fascist or totalitarian impulses in the subject to hand.

Blatham --

Not to turn this into a contest -- but yes, my fascists are indeed bigger than yours. And they are bigger by such a ridiculously large margin that I can't take it serious when I hear the rhetoric about the far out Republicans being fascists. David Duke -- yes. The KKK -- sure. But not DeLay, Rove and Bush. Words do have meanings, and "fascism" is a word whose meaning I'd prefer to leave unblurred.

And they are bigger by such a ridiculously large margin that I can't take it serious when I hear the rhetoric about the far out Republicans being fascists. David Duke -- yes. The KKK -- sure. But not DeLay, Rove and Bush. Words do have meanings, and "fascism" is a word whose meaning I'd prefer to leave unblurred.

DeLay, Rove, and Bush are smart enough to know that the country won't accept what they really desire if they present it right up front.

Facism doesn't happen overnight; you have to give them some time...

Yes, yes, yes georgeob, it is about differences in values. The values of the fanatics are rarely those of more open minded types. And the values of the New Right are diametrically opposed to my values. I'm not a fanatic, I'm just an informed person who is worried about the level of organization they have been able to establish before anyone has noticed.

I think some in the electorate are becoming aware of the New Right's activities and sooner or later the sane voters will come to recognize the danger they pose. It's my goal to speed that recognition along the best I can. When a large enough component of the voters finally recognize it, I'm hopeful they will deal with them at the polls........if (and maybe even though) the states haven't all been gerrymandered (as in Texas and Colorado). However, it may well be too late for the Supreme Court. If the New Right has it's way there, and they do intend to push it hard this time, it will take another 50 years to recover.

I agree with you Thomas, the internal checks and balances of our system of government may temper the damage some. I'm surely hoping so. But the checks and balance function that is built into our governmental system is already strained now. If support from the electorate doesn't back it up, then we're all in for a nightmare.

And, true enough, there may be an evolving compromise over time.........but I can't see what it would be. If laws pertaining to abortion, for example, become the right of the states, we'll see some states making abortion illegal and that means disaster for the poor and young women of those states.

It's easy to say, "well, you know, it's nature's way." But nature's way is harsh and unnecessarily cruel.

And btw, Thomas, the extremists behind the New Right are not too different from the KKK in many ways. They definitely discriminate against women. (Women submit to your husbands) And they are manipulative and destructive to their children and to anyone who is different from themselves.

They produce children who are either rebels and some psychopathically so, or automatons. Their families are based on the most harsh interpretation of the rule of biblical law rather than on the value of teaching children how to make decisions based on the internal development of personal moral values.

A person is limited when that person depends on imposed or adopted values, externally given and enforced. When the pressure from reality is strong, as it will be many times in a person's life, external controls are not dependable in helping that person maintain fair conduct or in helping that person make tough and sometimes very complicated decisions.

And racial prejudice abounds, with these fanatical Christians, even though couched in "loving" terms. I'm not talking about people who like to use rules as a back up, as a rule of thumb, I'm talking about the fanatics who believe all there is to depend on is absolute rules, period, as if life presents only simple easy challenges. In many of these homes, you'd be amazed what goes on. Many of their children make it.........those strong enough to resist and make it out into the larger world.......but many do not.

Of course, george, I'm not claiming that only fanatical Christians have fu*ked up kids. Fanatics of any kind share these same characteristics. But it is an established subculture, built on intimidation and coercion. It's a top down power structure and those at the top are largely male, although if the women support the men in their authority, they are allowed a voice, especially if it helps them look as if they're concerned about the rights of others. The sub-culture is anti-intellectual and dogmatic.

All this wouldn't be such a concern to me.....even though I hate to see it, and I see plenty of it, if that was all. What I'm worked up about is that they are now in a position to impose these same tactics and absolute standards on the American people.

It's fool hardy, I think, to say, "oh well, there aren't enough of them......they'll be so extreme the system will take care of them," when the system is already under attack and quivering. I hope the extreme New Right will be stopped by the American voters before the damage is too great.

What a load of horseshit ! All bombast and no substance, unless you are inclined to believe that all non-Democrats in the country are organized in a 'vast right-wing conspiracy'. (come to think of it, who said that?)

Did he leave anything out? Even threw is some standard slurs about the Bohemian Club summer encampment, and suggestions that Milton Friedman was the paid economic hack of the evil Coors family fortune or something of that ilk.

It is a long (and tedious) article with lots and lots of specific references and anecdotes. In every one in which I have some direct knowledge it was evident that the author not only has his facts wrong, but also misses the truth of what he describes.

Nowhere does he acknowledge that a similar tissue of deception could just as easily be woven out of analogous unrelated elements on the liberal side. He even throws in a few snide references to Joe McCarthy, while, at the same time, outdoing the dyspepsic Senator in his own conspiracy fantasies.

It takes a small mind to buy this stuff, but sadly there are a few of them out there.

There is little or no reason why we ought to grant your protest any credence at all, and here's why.

It counters specifics by not countering specifics.

I find it interesting that Mr. Lapham describes in 7000 words a movement he clearly perceives as a bunch of fundamentalist fanatics, without ever providing arguments why the conservatives are wrong on the issues, and the "basic American consensus" of 1960 was right on the issues. Or, perhaps more approporiate for someone who despises absolutes, why the liberals of 1960 were closer to being correct about the issues than the conservatives of 2000.

First of all, would you please forward for the rest of us what your definition of 'political analysis' might be.

Secondly, you could go back and re-read Krugman's talk at the London School of Economics (where he addressed some of the same history and it's consequences) and clarify whether that talk involves 'political analysis' and how it might be different from Lapham's piece.

As to how this movement might be 'wrong', I doubt very much that you and I can make much headway. You are, if I may be so bold, a numbers guy. Ideologies don't seem to register for you as real things, thus neither the consequences of them.

Blatham,

Do you really mean to suggest that one whose perceptions are not shaped by a steady diet of TV and daily newspapers, and occasionally augmented by the odd piece of contemporary political analysis, is incapable of accurate critical thought and judgement? Do you really mean to say this?
Incapable of critical thought and judgement? Of course not. The problem lies with the word 'accurate'. How could one presume accuracy regarding judgements when one does not keep abreast of changes and new information? What could Voltaire tell us about the origins of hominids in Africa? What could Eisenhower tell us about modern monetary policies? You continue to assume the modern Republican party as seen in this White House is not significantly changed from the Republican party of Eisenhower, and that is just factually wrong. Even Thomas speaks of his hope that the grownups will regain control, but I don't know how many more years, and tragic mis-steps have to be behind us, before he acknowledges that they have been purposively removed and marginalized.

I have made a few, mostly idle, attempts to find something of interest or value on the tube, even on the myriad cable channels now available - virtually nothing, though the process can be narcotic. The best, when it is found, usually involves 5 minutes of material spun up to fill 30.

I'm with you here for the most part, but one particularly important gain from watching a steady diet of TV news is, if you do it, a dawning awareness that TV news media too has changed in very important and negative ways. Yes, it was, to match yours.
Surely in reading the piece it occurred to you how easily one could construct a similar fantasy about a well-funded, institutionally supported, liberal conspiracy, systematically and subtly influencing American thought and politics. Replace Scaife &amp; Olin with Soros and the like; the Hoover &amp; Heritage Institutes with any of the many liberal equivalents, and there you are. Common sense tells us that both are fantasies. Anyway here's a specific for you - The Bohemian Club then had 1,800 members, not 600, and partisan politics is rarely discussed at the Grove - bad form.
But no, you couldn't george, and that's the factual part of this picture.

Now, look. I quite love you and Thomas both. Thomas leads in the lovefest because he at least acknowledges the constant deceits of this administration as regards its economic statements, and the dangers that are more and more likely to accrue if the present policies are continued.

A text pertaining to politics, whose conclusions are characterized by refutable conjectures and reproducible evidence. The text in question does pertain to politics, but it mostly asserts its conclusions, and its evidence, where relevant to the conclusions, rarely rises above the level of gossip. Where I see relevant evidence and conclusions in the same paragraph, the logical chain linking them is inconclusive, as for example in the following paragraph.

<quote>
An opinion poll taken in 1964 showed 62 percent of the respondents trusting the government to do the right thing; by 1994 the number had dwindled to 19 percent. The measure can be taken as a tribute to the success of the Republican propaganda mill.
</quote>

This inference -- arguably the soundest I found in the whole article -- does not begin to consider alternative explanations, such as the obvious one that the respondents had simply learned from experience that the government expansion of from 30s to the 60s had not kept the promises with which it had been justified. Not to dwell on the substance of the point, but this does go to show just how gaping the holes in Mr. Lapham's logic are.

Do you mean <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/LSEPublicLecturesAndEvents/pdf/20040526-WhitherAmericaPaulKrugman.pdf">this article?</a> Yes, it does contain political analysis. Unlike Lapham, Krugman starts with relevant evidence, which I am in a position to fact check myself, and he connects them to his conclusions with logically sound arguments. Unlike Lapham, Krugman does consider alternative explanations for his evidence and usually gives a good reason why he rejected them. The consequence is that Krugman could persuade me, and has indeed persuaded me, that something is very fishy at the top of the Republican party. Lapham, by contrast, is doomed to keep preaching to the converted. (Sorry about my religious terminology there <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"/> )

I don't follow you here. Liberals and conservatives both predict that their way of doing things will produce more desirable outcomes than the other side's way of doing things. We may disagree about what consequences are desirable, and this disagreement may indeed involve unresolvable ideological differences. But whether the consequences are what their proponents expected them to be can be tested with empirical evidence, and thus accessible even to a numbers guy like me. For example, when Mr. Lapham treats the quagmire in Iraq as evidence against the conservative ideology that produced it, he should be asking why the last war started by a liberal president looks so remarkably similar to it. He doesn't -- and I am suspecting that the reason he doesn't is that making the comparison would refute implicit assumptions he is making, and which he is unwilling to reconsider.

Damn ! Second place.

I've encountered Thomas' economic argument as well. Viscerally, I believe strongly that he is either wrong on the fundamentals or (perhaps more likely) wrong to pin it on the current administration. If there is a grave, underlying problem, I believe it relates more to our trade deficit than contemporary tax policy or government spending. That problem goes back 40 years and touches the fundamentals of our trade and consumption tax policies. He will likely introduce some arcane economics equation that connects the two. (My problem there is that I find the mathematics of the economics texts I have read so far, quite unsatisfying - they are very loose with their definitions and hidden assumptions). So to hell with both of you.

I have never met anyone who, after life has finally introduced him to the bear, hasn't any element of the spiritual somewhere in his inner life. I am skeptical on this point.

You are better informed than I on matters of contemporary political analysis. However I regard this as but one of several good ways to collect the insights, regarding the behavior of humans and their tribes, leaders, governments and nations, need to correctly evaluate and interpret contemporary events. Inscribed above the portal of the National archives building on Constitution Ave. in Washington is the phrase "What is Past is Prologue". It is true. (BTW I don't regard Thomas Jefferson as the most adult or mature of our founding fathers. There were too many contradictions in his words and actions, particularly in his later years. Washington was by far his superior.)

I do agree with Thomas' interpretation of the article in question. It was just an accumulation of anecdote and innuendo, devoid of dispassionate analysis or balanced rational interpretation. As usual ha got to the heart of it with fewer words than I. However, it figures: he's German. I'm Irish.

"Seeing the bear" = encountering something that shakes you to the core.

In my first squadron I had two very close friends; Will Turner, and Tom Curry. We worked out, flew, and raised hell together, during a wonderful four-plane deployment to (of all places- Kindley Air Force base in Bermuda. Paradise for 22 year old pilots on the hunt. One day while snorkelling in St George's bay I looled up and saw one of our aircraft, just after take-off, roll inverted and fly into a low hill - it was Will. Five days later back at home base in Florida and just after the Memorial Service, Tom and I were working out in the base gym - he was doing bench presses when he dropped the bar and began what appeared to me to be a seizure of some kind. In fact his aorta had burst from an undedected aneurysm, and he died in my arms. I had seen the bear. There were still other encounters to come, but this was when I first understood that life is finite and unpredictable.

Kicking this one back up to the top, because we're not through talking about it.

Encountering more than the usual "Jesus is the reason for the season" claptrap that bubbles up this time of year, I am motivated to a response.

Our nation is, by design, a secular nation. Our founders took great pains to ensure that the underpinning of our government was not religious. Nevertheless, many of our fellow citizens are Christians, and have a secular-democracy-granted right to believe and practice their faith (and I wouldn't have it any other way).

Now that it's popular for conservatives to talk about our Christian nation, though, a little something has crossed my mind. Usually that kind of talk gives us secular types visions of a theocracy, not to mention constant low-level irritation at having to listen to political types who apparently have never read the Constitution. But Christianity, like all faiths, has a lot to say about how one should live one's life. So I wondered: is there an upside for all of us, Christian or not, in living in a country where the majority of people are Christians?

Consider that the New Testament tells us a lot about the life of Jesus and how he said we should live. For example, Jesus identified strongly with his society's poorest and most downtrodden and sickly people, and he instructed his followers to do the same. So in a highly Christian-influenced nation, shouldn't we expect that people would expend considerable resources helping the poor and support social policy that helps us ensure that people do not starve, or freeze in the street, have access to basic necessities like food and shelter and medical care, and generally create a society where people look out for each other and help those who have the least?

Well, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/357/5141957.html">then again, maybe not.</a>

If I'm going to have to live in a nation full of Christians, I would appreciate it if more of them paid a little more attention in Sunday School and actually followed their faith.

</quote>

Some errors here. Virtually all of the founders and signatories of both the Declaration of Independence and later the Constitution were practicing Christians. They took great pains to ensure that the new republic they were creating would countenance no establishment of a particular religion, and that the states that made it up would not do so either. This was done in the context of the original colonies which, with only two exceptions, did at various times have established forms of Christianity built in to both their colonial charters and, as well their various laws and legislatures, The exceptions were Maryland and Rhode Island (which was established by some Protestants seeking to escape the intolerance of others in Massachusetts.)

However the founders most assuredly did not intend that the government they created would be anti-religion or would forbid any expression relating to the existence of God in its activities. On the contrary, they made specific reference to God the creator in the Declaration of Independence, and to the freedom of people to practice their religious views in the Constitution. Moreover the new government from its beginnings, in the proceedings of the Executive, the Legislature, and the Courts employed numerous references to God in its pronouncements, prayers and exhortations in its ceremonies and rituals; and even chaplains in its military and naval organizations.

The so-called,:"wall of separation between church and state" is not an article of our law at all. It but a phrase used by Thomas Jefferson in his private correspondence.

This original practice is not what many secularists are seeking now - they seek a government that will not countenance any expression of religion, the presence of any religious symbols, or merely the reference to God in any of its direct activities or any activity which it either sponsors or funds.
This kind of de facto atheism is specifically contrary to both what is expressed in the founding documents of our contry and to the known actions and intent of our founders.

So george, if everyone gets to practice the religion of their choice.......why can't they do so within their own family? There's nothing wrong with religion as long as everyone is respectful about the rights of others. It's like smoking in a public place. Smoking at home or out on the balcony is fine, but doing so where others are subjected to your second hand smoke violates the rights of others.

What is so hard about this concept? It seems clear and fair to me. I don't know anyone who is advocating freedom from religion. But public places should be religion neutral.

I agree. This year, when "Merry Christmas" apparently is a politically incorrect phrase, it seemed a bit strange when I did not hear it all over the place. After awhile, I began to enjoy the lack of the greeting. In years past, it seemed that you could not escape from the Christmas greetings.

I find though, that I do get just a bit out of joint when a store clerk asks me if I am "ready" for Christmas. I usually answer something like, "I am as ready as I will ever be", which is the exact truth!

I don't buy Lola's methaphor with respect to smoking in public at all. References to God, or the absence of them, or to prominent religious symbols, or their absence, don't in themselves do any harm to anyone - as does second hand smoke. I believe that individual freedom and mutual consideration should dominate here. If one university, public or private, is pleased to omit any invocation or reference to God from (say) its graduation ceremonies, that is fine with me. Similarly if another wishes to include them that too is OK. The people can choose their universities and their ceremonies. If they are displeased by the presence or the absence of such references they can stay away or go elsewhere. Nothing in our law or constitution compels the government to purge references to either God or Christianity from its public utterances. It is merely prohibited from establishing any particular religion. If you don't like to hear specific Christmas Greetings your friends and even some of your casual contacts will sense that and oblige. Such perception and consideration should be encouraged on that and many other things as well. By the same token those who find solace and joy in them should not be denied offering and getting such greetings when they believe they will be welcome. We must all make some accommodations to others if we are to live together agreeably and peacefully.

I guess it has something to do with all people being equal in America and the ability to respect each others rights. That's why when I see a christmas tree, nativity scene, menorah, kwanzaa bush, sickle and mistletoe, or whatever, I do not get offended.

this is one of those subjects that gets weird for me. while i don't really like the "under god" in the pledge, and wish it had not been added in the fifties, i have no problem at all with the city putting up a nativity scene at christmas. probably good idea to also raise a star of david.

pretty soon, ya can't make your way through it all, and the city hall is not getting anything done, because they can't get past religion ( articales, that is).

I have no problem with menorahs or other symbols celebrating Judiasim on their holidays or holydays as the case may be. Same goes with the symbols of Islam as long as its proponents exhibit and accept the religious tolerance that is indeed a core element of the required civil virtues of this country. All should also give consideration to unbelievers who wish merely to either ignore or make a holidays out of such events. Toleration and considerate accomodation for others are the key elements here. Kwanzaa was invented out of whole cloth by black activists a few decades ago. It is not at all religious, but it does indeed emphasize self reliance and family values- it lacks the stature of the great religions, but does no harm.

Evangelicals Use Courts to Fight Restrictions on Christmas Tidings

By Alan Cooperman
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, December 20, 2004; Page A01

From Mustang, Okla., to Maplewood, N.J., they are filing or threatening lawsuits to win the inclusion of manger scenes in school plays, Christmas carols in school concerts and Christmas trees in public buildings.

"The pendulum has swung completely," said Charles Haynes, a senior scholar at the nonprofit First Amendment Center in Arlington. "There's a push-back by many conservative Christians, perhaps emboldened by the recent election and by the increasing presence of evangelical Christianity in the public arena. They're saying the secularization of our society and public schools has gone too far and become hostility to their religion."

Last year, a school administrator stopped Jonathan Morgan at the door to his classroom because the "goody bag" he had brought to a school party on the last day before Christmas vacation contained candy canes with a religious message attached. Titled "The Legend of the Candy Cane," it said the candy was shaped in a J for Jesus and bore a red stripe "to represent the blood Christ shed for the sins of the world."

This year, the 9-year-old and his evangelical Christian parents went straight to court. They were among four families who persuaded Judge Paul Brown, of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, to issue a temporary restraining order on Thursday securing their children's right to hand out "religious viewpoint gifts" at school-sponsored holiday parties.

The family had some high-powered help. Two conservative nonprofit law firms, the Liberty Legal Institute and the Alliance Defense Fund, took the case free of charge. The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice also wrote the Plano Independent School District last week to say it was investigating its "alleged refusal to permit students to distribute religious messages during school parties and on school property."

Kelly Shackelford, the Liberty Legal lawyer who argued the case, said in a telephone interview that Supreme Court decisions since 1969 clearly have established that students do not give up free-speech rights when they walk through the school door. Expressions of religious faith that would be unconstitutional coming from a teacher in a classroom are acceptable among students as long as they do not "materially and substantially disrupt" school operations, he said.

The Plano school district's lawyer, Richard Abernathy, maintained that school administrators can impose reasonable restrictions on the "time, place and manner" of students' religious speech.

"This area is predominantly white, and it's predominantly Christian. Frankly, it's pretty conservative Christian," he said. "We have to be careful, though, that those students who are Hindu or Islamic or Jewish don't have their rights trampled on."

Doug Morgan said his son was a victim of "political correctness spiraling out of control." He noted that the school had informed parents that only white paper plates and napkins -- no Christmas red and green -- would be allowed at the generic "Winter Break" party.

"They are so determined not to offend anyone," he said, "that we're being silenced and made to feel that what we want to share is not appropriate to share in a public environment."

That is an increasingly common holiday sentiment, said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, a legal advocacy group founded by the Rev. Pat Robertson.

Twenty or 30 years ago, Sekulow said, the vast majority of lawsuits over Christmas displays were filed by secular groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, to block the placement of religious symbols on public property. Though there are still some gray areas, he said, those cases established fairly clear precedents about what does and does not violate the First Amendment's prohibition on government establishment of religion.

On Friday, the ACLJ persuaded officials in Pasco County, Fla., to reverse their decision to remove Christmas trees from all public buildings. Daniel R. Johnson, an assistant county administrator, said the removal had been triggered by a request from a resident to put a Hanukah menorah next to the Christmas tree in the public library.

At first, county officials feared that "if you open the door to one, then you must open the door to all, and not just during the holiday season, but all year long," Johnson said. But on further review, he said, the county's attorney decided there would be "little legal risk" in a temporary display of both a menorah and a Christmas tree, along with a sign saying they are symbols of "our legacy of freedom."

In other cases across the country, Christian groups have argued in court this month against a New York City school policy that allows menorahs during Hanukah and the Islamic crescent during Ramadan but not Nativity scenes during Christmas. A federal judge in Florida on Wednesday ordered the town of Bay Harbor Islands to grant a resident's request to erect a creche next to a local synagogue's menorah on public property.

In Maplewood, N.J., Christian groups threatened to sue over the school district's policy of allowing secular songs, such as "Jingle Bell Rock," but not hymns, such as "Silent Night," at student concerts. In Mustang, Okla., voters angry over the school superintendent's decision to remove a Nativity scene from a student play helped defeat a $10.4 million bond issue to build a new elementary school.

Barry Lynn, executive director of the advocacy group Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the "new strategy of the Christian Right is forced inclusion -- they take a secular display and demand that Christian symbols and carols be added."

Christian talk radio, Lynn said, is fueling a "huge movement saying there is a war against Christmas both by the government and by private business, which I think is nonsensical, because unless you live in a cave in America in December, you know it's Christmas."

But Anthony R. Picarello Jr., a lawyer with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which works for greater freedom of religious expression, said it is not easy to say which side is truly the aggressor. "If these Christmas pageants and displays have been done for a long time and now there's a push to exclude them, then it appears to be aggression from the left. If they haven't been done and someone's suing to add them, then it appears to be aggression from the right."

george however, does believe that Christianity is the 'one true faith'.

Might we assume that those voices here and elsewhere bemoaning the 'victimization of christianity in America' are similarly minded?

"America is and always has been a Christian nation" and other claims holding the same meaning are not likely to be founded upon any desire for diversity of view or for equal status for all worldviews. They are found, perhaps always, in a context of 'christianity is special/superior/more true'.

The dilemma for any state, if it wishes to promote freedom of ideas and expression and religious belief/practice (which surely was the founders' wish) is that religious groups will commonly attempt to gain a particularly influential status within the state for their own religious ideas, practices and values. They will commonly act to marginalize other belief sets so that their own remains or becomes dominant.

The dilemma for all of us who hold to the principles of diversity and religious freedom forwarded by the founders is that is is quite likely to be our own faith - certainly the majority faith - which is the potential oppressor. Sri Lanka is in little danger of finding the christian church thwarting principles of freedom of religion. America or Canada is in substantially more danger of that.

If one is to stand guard against what the founders tried to prevent, then one must acknowledge that the majority faith is the one most likely to cause a problem. And that is precisely one of the reasons why folks like me aim at Christianity, and not at Dervishes or satan worshippers or animists.

Blatham,

When secular humanists become the majority, will you advocate government action on behalf of religion to dilute their then dominant influence, just to preserve the diversity you value above all other things?

There are many dic=verse groups or sects of Christiabity in the USA&gt; Though they compete with one another to a degree, I have not observed any dangerous suppression of one by the other. I think this is a dead horse (more or less a defeated straw man)

By the way may I wish you and Lola the happiest of Christmases

As it happens, it is also found by anyone reading the demographic information in the Historical Statistics of the United States. Moreover, they are easily found by reading or the Bills of Rights in the <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/stateco.htm">State Constitutions</a> at the time America was founded. They did tend to give Christianity a privileged status, while prohibiting the establishment of any particular Christian denomination. As I understand it from my somewhat casual reading of history books, the federal constitution did not change this at the time, because it originally was binding only to the federal government. It wasn't until the Civil War that any part of the federal bill of rights became enforceable against the States. And it wasn't until the New Deal and Great Society Supreme Courts that the Supreme Court's doctrine of incorporation was understood to prohibit States from any expressions of religious belief.

None of this goes to deny that seperation of church and state is a good idea. I think those founding fathers who gave Christianity a privileged status were wrong, and I more or less agree on the substance of Supreme Court rulings on this matter over the last 70 years or so. I just don't think you're doing yourself a favor by ignoring that your opponent have a lot of the relevant history and the relevant demographics on their side.

Are you sure? David Hume, widely believed to be an atheist, supported establishment of a religion because he thought it would "bribe the indolence of the clergy". Judging by the European experience, Hume seems to be right. Sweden, the role model for many an American liberal, is a monarchy with an established religion. On the available evidence, that's exactly what George Bush wants to turn America into. So what's your problem?

If one lot of nuisances feel terrorised by a bit of second hand tobacco smoke,which is free,why shouldn't another lot of nuisances feel terrorised by exhausts from motors and airplanes or even dioxin plants positioned,for a time at least,in areas of cheap labour.

Spendius......I think they should.

Just like second hand smoke, I've never minded or thought much about the Merry Christmas greeting. I like Christmas. It can be fun. I taught my children that it was a celebration of life. And it works that way for me. And I don't object to it now. The market place is no place for suppression of expression. Christian marketing this time of year keeps the world afloat.

But Christianity has caused me and my family a lot of trouble. When my children were young they were terrorized by evangelical christians telling them their mother and father would burn in hell.

In public places, and especially in the schools, I prefer expressions of personal religious belief to remain private out of respect for the rights of others to believe and teach their children as they choose about religion.

I hope the evangelicals do go completely off the deep in on this. I'm hoping the "pendelum has completely swung the other way" because if so, it's finally time for it to begin it's swing back.

I'm in a hurry right now.....I have to hurry out to celebrate the birth of Christ in the market place. So I can't take the time now to fully express myself with the skill and creativity the occasion deserves. But I'll be back.

Wishes returned.

You and Thomas (thanks on the legal end of the matter, re which I need to read up, but yes, the principle is the more important element) make a rather clumsy error in equating all 'ideologies'.

To put this another way, would you hold that Taliban-style ideology or fifteenth century witch-hunter ideology or biblical literalist ideology is equal (an exceedingly cute mouse just ran between my feet...perhaps I'll put out a little red stocking with cheese) to an 'ideology' which promotes inclusiveness on principle or which promotes free speech on principle or which promotes an empirical process of discovery? In characteristics and in function, you need to differentiate 'ideologies' precisely as one needs to differentiate the Mafia and the Boy Scouts, though both are 'groups'. Is 'secular humanism' indistinguishable, in any important characteristic related to a discussion of how best to organize the polity, from 'white supremacy'?

As regards your second paragraph, you once again fall back on your utterly dependable 'it couldn't possibly happen here' thesis. Nowhere to go with that one, other than wait until things to get even more transparent in this area as things have become in Iraq such that denial is no longer an option except for the few who cannot cannot cannot conceive of a round earth.

Quite sure. It's a simple point...the dangers of majoritarian influence and the dangers of exclusion of others by those in a priviledged position.

Hume's time and political circumstances, like Descartes, are not much comparable to the present American situation. His assault on the power and the illogic of the church and its theology at that point in time mark, for me, one of the great advances in Western thought. What do you think Hume might say today? You figure he'd join up with the evangelical right or with the ACLU?

You inquire 'what's your problem?'. This is a rhetorical move you make quite often. How about, rather than challenging a thesis (which is fine), you advance your own (which is rare).

This is slightly off topic, but pertinent I think. When I attended public school in an small mill town in Connecticut. Which I did K through 12. The school day always began with reciting the lords prayer. That might seem innocuous enough accept that there are three positions on the lords prayer; Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish.. All three of these ritual communities were represented among my class mates. Thus the day began with all 30 of us in the class, standing beside our desk, head bowed, some reciting the long version (Protestant), the short version (Catholic) or not reciting it at all (Jewish). As all three of these versions could be identified with ethnic communities, the prayer started the day by immediately identifying ethnic/ritual community membership, Yankee (Protestant) French Canadian/Italian (Catholic) and eastern European (Jewish). This identity was reinforced else ware in private life with explicitly endogamous messages which all of us received. To wit: "don't you ever come home with one of _________" (fill in appropriate excluded group). The prayer reminded us daily who the _________ were and as we got older, who was an appropriate date (opposite sex only this was 35 years ago). In retrospect (and several anthropology degrees later) I have concluded that the purpose of that daily recitation had nothing to do with religion, and everything to do with making explicit community boundaries.

</quote>

I think it is. David Hume (and Adam Smith) believed that when the production of religion is left to a free market of ideas, that would produce very vibrant and very virulent religions. By contrast, when religion is a government-granted monopoly, they thought the managers of the established religion would become lazy, boring, and moderate. Adam Smith, a non-zealot believer in god, opposed government-established religions on those grounds. Hume, being an atheist, sympathised with government establishments for the same reason.

<quote orig_author="Blatham">

</quote>

I know too little biographic information about David Hume to be certain. But judging by his work, I guess he would abhor organized politics. If forced at gunpoint to choose between the ACLU and the Religious Right, I'm sure he would rather join the ACLU. But his obvious preference of reasoning over bullying seems so intense to me that he wouldn't have joined either organization unless forced at gunpoint. I guess he'd rather have an Op-Ed column in the New York times. I can see him blog, too. I am fairly certain he would have preferred turning people around by persuading them rather than through political pressure.

</quote>

The "What's your problem" part was meant as a joke. I thought about adding a twinky face, but I mistakenly thought it was obvious enough. The thesis behind the paragraph you attacked is that political movements and institutions often have very different consequences than their proponents intend, and their opponents fear. In particular, I think the intensity of religious zeal in America probably is a direct consequence of the non-establishment clause, which American liberals defend and the Religious Right tries to erode. By contrast, the relative religious apathy in Europe probably is a direct consequence of past and present religious establishments, formal and informal, which American liberals would oppose and the Religious Right would support if somebody tried it in America.

In my humble opinion, that's an interesting point which Hume made, and Smith bought, on theoretical grounds, and which I think the current reality in Europe and America supports. It is also a non-obvious point, judging by the fact that I was unable to communicate it to you on my first try.

As to the functioning of the Religious Right, I think it intends to transform Europe in its image, but I don't think it's going to. For better or worse -- mostly for worse -- I expect the Religious Right's influence to prove similarly limited as the Anti-nuke-movement's influence on American defense politics during the Cold War, or disruptive campus politics by socialist Students in the sixties, or apocalyptic environmentalism in the seventies and eighties, and other comparable movements.

Lola-,
In what way is Xmas fun?Its just one complete mess of junk,lies,posturings,pollutions,frenzies,foolishness,anxieties,poisonings,drivel,illusion and general allround fatuity.As a celebration of life it is perfectly adapted.
The last words from the sponsor before CBS News came on last night were-
"Everybody loves a bargain (a lie x3)and Christmas is coming early this year."( a stupe) and then Rather appeared to tell us that 22 Marines had been killed because a safe mess hall wasn't ready.
So that's a lot of fun I must say.

Would you believe it,the tragic story from Mosul was third item on our own news.

If Xmas is fun what's the rest of the year?

Do you really think there is no suppression of expression in the market place.Wow!And the world need Christian marketing to stay afloat.WOWxlarge number.Which world do you mean.
Oh-sorry-your world.That's okay then.For a moment I thought you meant THE world.Once you get into assertions the door is wide for Christian evangelicals to have a go.
Wouldn't there be a danger without some kind of grounding in schools of the US having 200 million different belief systems and that might cause some problems.You would be bound to get a few headshrinkers and whirling dervishes.Is not that what Babel means.
Shop till you drop-its heroic.It says so here.Its saving the world.

Happy holiday.

Blatham &amp; Thomas,

I am bemused by the reverence paid to the lives, beliefs and writings of the likes of Hume and Adam Smith, by those who would likely reject out of hand any reference to the moral or intellectual authority of Thomas Aquinas or a Teilhard de Chardin.

This is not a profession on my part that the latter two are sole possessors of any particular aspect of eternal truth. On the contrary, I am aware above all things that my mind can conceive of crucial possibilities about the origin and potential purpose or meaning of my existence which it cannot resolve or understand. Occasionally, when stimulated by some wonderful thought, scene or interaction with another, I have briefly felt the presence or a glimpse of a deeper understanding. However, even there, much can also be explained by momentary intellectual intoxication, and in some cases the chemical variety, or even glandular activity. Despite this some remains - and is sought for again.

I suspect that in some form or another such experiences are common to all. I have found a way to live with them that is satisfactory to me as have others done so for themselves. Those of us of a like mind have a perfect right to share our expressions of it as long as we do no actual harm to others, The same goes for groups with other views. Whether this takes forms we might call religion, or non-religion, or even anti-religion, we are all entitled to the expression of these views in any and all aspects of our lives - provided that we do not unduly injure others in doing so.

If I were to find that Pablo Picasso was an awful wretch and decide that his works were not only devoid of merit, but also occasionally expressive of dangerous sentiments, would that confer on me the right to live my life free of the second hand "smoke' of Picasso lovers? Not likely - no one would concede to me the right to enforce such a sensitivity on the behavior of others - and rightly so.

For me atheist, secularist or anti-religious views are no less entitled to expression by those who hold them than are their religious alternatives. At the same time they are no more entitled to expression than are references to God or the common forms of religious expression found in a particular place. Tolerance and freedom go hand in hand. Those who would prohibit all references to God or religion in public life generally are content with the secular or even atheistic impressions left in the resulting void, and usually unwilling to concede that this too is an expression of a view in this area. This intolerance is a serious suppression of important individual freedom.

If any and all references to God or religious symbols are precluded in public life, in the name of protecting the sensitive from the second hand smoke of ideas offensive to them, then Picasso could well be next. Think of that!

Picasso lover rarely tell others they are going to hell for not accepting Picasso into their lives. Christians do this all the time; it's not the beliefs of Christians that bother people, it's the fact that they almost constantly try to force their archaic and illogical rules upon the rest of society.

So nice of you to paint with such a broad brush.

I do not see Christians wearing clothing that represents their religious beliefs in public (which is their right).

I do not see Christians leaders today telling other Christians to kill non Christians to satisfy their God.

So what is it exactly that you resent about Christians?

Gotcha! I have to admit that this is the first time I read the name Teilhard de Chardin. On the other hand, judging by the few excerpts I have read from Summa Theologica, I see no reason at all to reject the moral and intellectual authority of Thomas Aquinas. On the contrary, I find ample reason to respect that authority.

I feel the same way, and I'd like to add that the attitude Lola expressed in her analogy with second hand smoke feels uncomfortably similar to many a conservative's attitude towards homosexuality. "Sure, if they have to fornicate, let them -- but keep it behind closed doors. Why do all these gays have to offend us by holding hands, even kissing, in public?" I don't like this "keep it in the closet" attitude when applied to homosexuality, and I don't like it when applied to religion either.
</post>
<post author="georgeob1" datetime="2004-12-22T15:22:00" id="p192">
Thomas,

I would as well agree with your comments with respect to homosexuality. There are limits however. I would not want my children to watch the "Gay Pride" day parade in San Francisco because of the rather gross excesses that too often infect what is otherwise a light-hearted expression of fellowship. One could also draw analogies with religion or, almost anything for that matter.

Perhaps the key underlying issue is a good balance of tolerance and freedom, as well as some norms, preferably cultural, but legal if there is no alternative, for the limitation of gross excess in any such expressions.

If you then wish to inquire why I oppose homosexual marriage, the reason has to do with the natural law (the process of procreation) and the social structures we have traditionally used to enhance the economic, physical, and moral circumstances surrounding the development of children - the next generation of members of our community &amp; culture, and the future taxpayers who will sustain the systems we count on for sustinence at the end of our lives. These things are distinct from homosexual unions in many important economic, legal, and moral areas. As long as these distinctions are preserved and no harmful dilution of the sustaining of traditional matrimony results, I have no objection whatever to legally sanctioned Homosexual unions, however they may be called.

Even a glance at the demographic statistics of the developed societies in which all this is an issue provides compelling proof that my concerns have merit.

We may speak the same language but us Yukkies speak it in a more traditional manner having been brought up on some real clunkheads.American attempts at irony often struggle to reach what we call sarcasm.Maybe a literature course concentrating on Pater,Mann,Pope,Swift,The Bard, Stern,Haggard,Partridge,Empson and stuff would be helpful.Then you could do Cartland for a post-graduate thesis.Or even Collins.

I know too little biographic information about David Hume to be certain. But judging by his work, I guess he would abhor organized politics. If forced at gunpoint to choose between the ACLU and the Religious Right, I'm sure he would rather join the ACLU. But his obvious preference of reasoning over bullying seems so intense to me that he wouldn't have joined either organization unless forced at gunpoint. I guess he'd rather have an Op-Ed column in the New York times. I can see him blog, too. I am fairly certain he would have preferred turning people around by persuading them rather than through political pressure.
</quote>

I suspect these sentences are less an accurate description of Hume than of their author. Or perhaps you misunderstand the goals and operations of the ACLU. As a recent head of that organization put it, when criticized by a womens' group for some legal stand the ACLU was supporting, "Our constituency is not any group of people. It is a set of principles." Hume not only wrote many political essays, but applied for chairs at two universities. Add in the projects he undertook in philosophy and one would have some trouble arguing convincingly that Hume would need a shotgun to his head to involve himself in contemporary issues or contemporary groups, particularly regarding the issues of religious dogma gaining greater foothold in the community or in the machinations of rule.

<quote>
In particular, I think the intensity of religious zeal in America probably is a direct consequence of the non-establishment clause, which American liberals defend and the Religious Right tries to erode.
</quote>

I'm afraid I don't grant this idea much credence. American history is unique in certain aspects, and one particular such aspect is the evangelical mythologies which have informed American thought since the nation's inception. There is a species of 'zeal' long alive in America, whether in temporary ascention or descention, which seems clearly to derive from the conception that America was to be the fount of a reinvigorated (and intrinsically more 'accurate') version of christianity as well as of civic organization. The two are inextricably linked.

<quote>
In my humble opinion, that's an interesting point which Hume made, and Smith bought, on theoretical grounds, and which I think the current reality in Europe and America supports. It is also a non-obvious point, judging by the fact that I was unable to communicate it to you on my first try.
</quote>

Interesting, yes. But I don't think you have this right, as I said.

<quote>
I don't believe that Hume would align himself as you have suggested above. I believe he would align himself as I suggested above, for the reasons I have given. As to the functioning of the Religious Right, I think it intends to transform Europe in its image, but I don't think it's going to. For better or worse -- mostly for worse -- I expect the Religious Right's influence to prove similarly limited as the Anti-nuke-movement's influence on American defense politics during the Cold War, or disruptive campus politics by socialist Students in the sixties, or apocalyptic environmentalism in the seventies and eighties, and other comparable movements.
</quote>

Not much I can do re the first and second sentences. I think you are dead wrong with Hume more than probably any other philosopher I can think of.

As to your expectation that the Religious Right will have no more influence than the anti-nuke movement, etc, it is exceedingly difficult to fathom how you might disregard the differences in your examples. How many anti-nuke individuals or environmentalists sought to gain power, though organization and activism, in thousands of school and hospital boards? How many sixties students attempted to insinuate themselves into positions of control within local riding organizations so as to gain leverage or outright control on nominations and party platform issues? How many environmentalists set out with ideological partners to establish, successfully, their own alternate media in the nation? How many womens' groups have their own weekly and daily tv shows with which to promote their ideas and agendas?

Earlier, either here or on some other thread, we talked about numbers and about verifiability in political theses. I appreciate your preferences here, but think them insufficient in themselves for such discussions. Who can tell us more that is 'true' about love, the bio-chemist or the poet? Who can better discern the 'truth' of political movements and consequences, Milton Friedman or George Orwell?

Who the hell is telling you how to celebrate Christmas? From what I see, it's YOU trying to FORCE your OPINION of what Christmas is about on OTHERS!!!

Striking stores that use the word holiday instead of christmas? Talk about the extreme. I don't believe ANYONE on A2K has tried to "take christmas away from you", like you so profess. Instead, I see it as a diversion technique, supplanted by the RNC (notice how Fox, Rush, Savage et all. are all talking about it) and you've just fallen for it hook line and sinker. You should be pissed at the media for making you believe us "heathens" want to destroy christmas, which is entirely NOT true. You get to enjoy Christmas just as everyone else. Hell, If you want to climb up a pole, dressed in womens lingerie and scream "Yippidie Doo-Daa" at the top of your lungs to celebrate christmas, go for it!!! I have no problem with anything you want to do.

It's a holiday, and yes, people do go over the edge on both side of the issues. But to go around and profess that christianity, the MAJORITY religion in this country, is being repressed, is an absolute joke. It's the press playing on your emotions and you've fallen hook line and sinker.

shall be burned as fuel for the fire.
For a child has been born for us,
a son given to us;
authority rests upon his shoulders;
and he is named
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
His authority shall grow continually,
and there shall be endless peace...
He will establish and uphold it
with justice and with righteousness
from this time onward and forevermore.

I'm afraid,old chap,that DrewDad is correct.He let you off a twite with "think" instead of "know".
We may speak the same language but us Yukkies speak it in a more traditional manner having been brought up on some real clunkheads.American attempts at irony often struggle to reach what we call sarcasm.Maybe a literature course concentrating on Pater,Mann,Pope,Swift,The Bard, Stern,Haggard,Partridge,Empson and stuff would be helpful.Then you could do Cartland for a post-graduate thesis.Or even Collins.

If any and all references to God or religious symbols are precluded in public life, in the name of protecting the sensitive from the second hand smoke of ideas offensive to them, then Picasso could well be next. Think of that!

george, Picasso has nothing to do with religion. Religion is a private matter. There's nothing wrong with an exhibition of religious paintings in a museum or in a privately owned gallery. But references to religion in a public place should not be allowed. Public places are for all the people. Schools for instance, are the only place for many disadvantaged families to provide an education for their children. Families should have and protect the right to teach their young children as they choose about religion. If you want children taught religion in public schools, it should be a survey course with equal, neutral treatment of all religions. Not likely to go over well with the conservatives. Or send your children or grandchildren to a private religious school of your choice. Or teach them at home.

Right-O. And he's some example too. Never mind yourself and your needs, provoke hard working people to kill you in an unbelievably gruesome way and then blame the entire world for it. How wholesome.

But buying stuff and having a good time with family and friends is the only good reason I can think of for Christmas. As long as one avoids neurotic hysteria.......which is especially hard for many gung ho christians.......look at their example after all. To them bleeding and dying for the sins of others is an example to emulate. Too bad they're inconsistent in their political beliefs. Man can these prissy christian ladies get nasty as the sacred day approaches. It's a deadline one can't re-schedule after all.

When I'm not acting exactly like them, it makes me be much nicer and feel more calm. There's nothing like seeing someone else act rudely to make a person get really nice. It's always nice to have someone else to blame.

8.6 million doesn't seem like many people travelling....but when they're doing it by air........it makes travel hair raising and damn near impossible to do without an outbreak or two of hysterical screaming and muttering of vile obscenities. 270 million could be explained as being those folks who are receiving the flying relatives or friends........but the number seems high. Maybe there are more sane people....or more likely poor folks than one would imagine by looking at our president. Jolly little jokester that he is.

And adultery can sometimes be the only sane way to manage the fun time of year. Lots of people decide to get a divorce over the holidays. It's a time of stress and mental disorder. And what's so fun is we all get to play. If I liked my family members better......or if I didn't hate some of them so much, I'd have a lot more fun. Wishing them exiled doesn't seem to help.

Fun times with the children, home from college, and grandchildren is redeeming. They get a lot of stuff they want.....I buy plenty for myself, the hated relatives and those unexpected guests who have just left their husbands with four or more children and have no clothes or apartment furnishings. This helps us endure the smiling and stupid prater one partakes in when spending time with annoying people.

I shopped almost exclusively at discount stores this christmas........cost a lot less. So I have more money for genuine debauchery as soon as I send the relatives packing. Fortunately the kids and I have some time after the others are off our backs to return the not right stuff and buy more on sale. Consumerism isn't half bad when I'm doing it. And after all, the economy needs the boost. And don't forget all those poor folks who get a few things they need from us sacrificing better off types. And please, cosmetics are necessary for some of us who want to be sexy and pretty. They're not a lie......not really. Everybody knows it's make-up. A lie would have to be a secret.......you wouldn't want to catch a look at me without cosmetics.......although I have no use at all for perfume or finger nail polish. But some people like it.

Look on the bright side spendius dolling........it's almost over and we can go back to work.

Did the CPD guys get a bag of switches and coal? I'll bet not. Some people have all the luck.

Now if you'll excuse me.........I have to get dinner for 12 (four of which I cannot abide...maybe I'll add a little extra arsenic <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/> ) on the table.

Hume not only wrote many political essays, but applied for chairs at two universities. Add in the projects he undertook in philosophy and one would have some trouble arguing convincingly that Hume would need a shotgun to his head to involve himself in contemporary issues or contemporary groups, particularly regarding the issues of religious dogma gaining greater foothold in the community or in the machinations of rule.
</quote>

I'm sorry, but you're bashing a strawman. None of this refutes the claim you are attacking, which was:

<quote orig_author="Thomas">
If forced at gunpoint to choose between the ACLU and the Religious Right, I'm sure he would rather join the ACLU. But his obvious preference of reasoning over bullying seems so intense to me that he wouldn't have joined either organization unless forced at gunpoint. I guess he'd rather have an Op-Ed column in the New York times. I can see him blog, too. I am fairly certain he would have preferred turning people around by persuading them rather than through political pressure.
</quote>

Or in other words: Contrary to your assertion, I am not denying that Hume, if he lived today, would "involve himself in contemporary issues". I just don't think that joining a political pressure group would have been his preferred way of involving himself politically. While I found it interesting to learn that Hume applied for chairs at two universities, I don't see how this supplies evidence against my point, since universities weren't thought of as political pressure groups at the time -- as well they shouldn't.

<quote orig_author="blatham">
How many anti-nuke individuals or environmentalists sought to gain power, though organization and activism, in thousands of school and hospital boards?
</quote>

I am judging from my experience in two highschools, one near Chicago, one in a small university town in Oregon, each of which I visited for about two weeks. I admit this is an unimpressive statistical sample. But for what it's worth, the biology curriculum in both schools taught a version of ecology that came pretty close to Gaia worship. In the geography lessons, the textbook of both schools, and in the classroom teaching of one of them, Cuba under Batista was portrayed as a Third World country, and Cuba under Castro was portrayed as a successful effort in bringing a Third World country up to speed with the industrial nations. It was also said in the textbooks that the world was facing an overpopulation crisis and that measures in the spirit of China's one-child policy were the right way to counter it. Sure, the price of forced abortions and sterilizations seemed high to the Westerner, but hey -- who are we to impose our values on other cultures? Overall, China was made to look a lot better in the Geography textbook than the Pope, who was portrayed as an old fool for disagreeing with policies to tie development aid to implementation of population-control policies.

Don't ask me how they did it, but it seems the environmentalists and socialists did a pretty good job at pushing their agenda into school curriculuae, contrary to the facts of the matter.

In addition to that, I don't think the EPA would have been incorporated without political pressure from environmentalist pressure groups like Ralph Naders. Nor do I believe it would have grown to its current size without that influence. Do you? While I agree that the left-wing pressure groups didn't coopt the political institutions the way the right-wingers did. But they were successful at coopting different institutions, and I stand by my judgment that their political success was comparable to that of the Religious Right: substantial, but limited.

<quote orig_author="blatham">
Who can tell us more that is 'true' about love, the bio-chemist or the poet? Who can better discern the 'truth' of political movements and consequences, Milton Friedman or George Orwell?
</quote>

I'd say that depends on what you want to know about the phenomenon in question. For example, if you want to know what it was like to live through the Great Depression, Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath and Orwell's Road to Wigan Pier are hard to beat. But both are unreliable sources if you want to know what caused the Great Depression, and how we as a society can prevent a new one. To this end, Keynes' "General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" will get you much farther. Milton Friedman's Monetary History of the United States is better still, but it's not a fair comparison. Friedman wrote in the fifties, not the thiries, so had access to information that the other three didn't.

Likewise, I wouldn't be surprised if Tom Wolfe writes the definitive novel about the Religious Right some day, and if it will tell us exactly what it feels like to be part of it, and what it feels like to be missionized by it. But if I want to reach an informed judgment on what its likely impact will be and what, if anything, I ought to do about it, I'll trust peer-reviewed sociologists, economists and ethnologists over novelists hands-down. The former sell their texts on their strength in figuring out facts, the latter merely sell their text on their strength in writing entertaining fiction.

Great imagery, DTOM. We can only hope it happens sooner rather than later. Thomas may not need to do anything. But we do. It's our country being co-opted by the primitive, fool hardy, power hungry few. I only hope they dive in with such strength, they'll paralyze themselves, as they did in 92. I've been hoping and hoping. They have so polarized the country it's painful.

If those not sufficiently alarmed in this last election begin to see what's going on, we can all return to agreeing to disagree and get on with our lives. I get so tired of being told how I should live and what values I should have to be considered to be family values. I have family values.....but not their definition of it. To them, family values means, prejudice and manipulation. My family values include helping my children learn to think, love and act for themselves.

It's a subversive climate at present. The Christians, ironically, are trying to subvert family values. Think of that.

Firstly, for Lola, the recent election was not won by a right wing religious conspiracy. It was lost by a Democrat party that cannot define itself amidst the cacophony of its disparate single interest zealots. The fact that it chose to nominate a self-absorbed feckless phony also helped. One of the most significant statistical features of the recent election was the large drop in the size of the Democrat majorities in even the bluest of the blue states.

There is no shortage of narrow-minded, ignorant people of every stripe. Some of them are self-styled environmentalists, sociologists, economists and some even historians. Some too are fundamentalist Christians. Not all environmentalists, sociologists, or Christians are fools, but some are. The impact of secular varieties of fools, as Thomas has illustrated, is at least as significant as that of religious-minded ones. That someone could successfully put forward in school textbooks he idea that contemporary Cuba is a successful economy or society is ample testimony to this point. This idea is no less foolish than the literal creationist notions that some fundamentalist religious zealots have tried. On what basis can anyone seriously argue here that one particular variety of these fools presents a much greater hazard than the others? Very frankly, I detect much stronger impulses towards authoritarianism among the fools of wacky environmentalism, sociology and like secular fields than I do among Fundamentalist Christians who at least emphasize persuasion over compulsion. To this extent the former are the more dangerous.

I don't deny that there exists people and groups suffused with rather odd religious notions. However I don't credit myself with the ability to truly measure or evaluate the internal qualities of one's religious experience, be he Jew, Christian, Bhuddist, Moslem or anything else. What is important to me is the kinds of behavior they encourage among their adherents. Were they to be given complete power, there is little doubt that some groups of fundamentalist Christians in the USA might impose restrictions on my life that I would dislike and resist. Happily that isn't yet the case, and most emphasize persuasion over compulsion. However, my world is already restricted by some idiotic doctrines of other secular varieties of fools - and their preferred method is to legislate their doctrines - they do prefer compulsion to persuasion.

george,

why do you keep putting these words in my mouth? And why are you spending so much time on this thread if all you have to say is that this or that isn't so?

Say something else about something else please. You're sounding like a broken record.

And please get that preachy tone out of your voice, old man......I'm beginning to feel uncooperative.

No matter what I say, you say the same thing over and over again. Let's try a new tactic........break it up a bit......come up with a new angle..........see things from a different perspective.......be creative in our imaginings.........stop going round and round in circles until we're dizzy. Get off your soap box and come down here with the common man (woman), sit and drink a good glass of Savingnon Blanc......New Zealand, 2002, si vous plait. Damn it, george. Be original for a change.

Come up with a new argument, or a least a new way of saying it so that I don't have to keep anticipating your next sentence. Open your eyes.....and cut the platitudes.

Quote me some Shakespeare........a sonnet maybe..........a Dylan ditty, or just something fun and kooky from Tom Waits........liberalize yourself, man.....you're lookin a little worn around the edges.

I used to emanate a similar kind of righteous indignation back in the eighties, when I was a greenish liberal myself. My particular variant was: "When Ronald Reagan's gets away with accelerating the arms race the way he does, the world is headed for a nuclear holocaust." Similarly, I've been getting comparable reactions from some of the more dogmatic liberals on this board when I discussed my views on global warming. (georgeob1 was there, so can correct me if I'm wrong.)

My point is that the kind of righteous indignation you are talking about is more similar between True Believers of any political ideology than you feel comfortable admitting. And so far, I have not seen any good evidence that there is any interesting difference between the self-righteous ideologues of the Religious Right and the self-righteousness ideologues on the Left. (Or the self-righteousness of ideological libertarians, of which we have our share just like any political philosophy.) So far, the assertions to the contrary really do seem to boil down to the "My shît don't stink" fallacy.

eloquent, but empty, thomas. and yes it is quite arrogant to imply that you, as a non-american, have a much better insight into what life in america is like. specifically if you've never been here. and let's say that you "visit" for a couple of weeks, a month or a few months. that will still only provide you with a superficial "flavor" of the experience of american daily life. you still will be without the empirical knowledge of a native born or long time immigrant american. my best pal is from dusseldorf. having never been there, i would never presume to be more knowledgeable or insightful about life there than he.

you, incorrectly, jump to the "liberal card" with me. i find left wing and right wing extremism equally intolerant. as for dogmatic, i reject it as a "begin all - end all" thought process. because it doesn't allow for a thought process. i personally don't subscribe to the "you are damned for all time" yip yap. from either end of the spectrum.

As it happens, I'm planning to, but I find the "you've got to see it to know it" line of argument generally unpersuasive. Please excuse my arrogance, and my repeating a line I've already delivered in this thread -- but I don't think American residents are in a privileged position to have insights into American society, any more than birds are in a priviledged position to have insights into ornithology.

eloquent, but empty, thomas. and yes it is quite arrogant to imply that you, as a non-american, have a much better insight into what life in america is like. specifically if you've never been here. and let's say that you "visit" for a couple of weeks, a month or a few months. that will still only provide you with a superficial "flavor" of the experience of american daily life. you still will be without the empirical knowledge of a native born or long time immigrant american. my best pal is from dusseldorf. having never been there, i would never presume to be more knowledgeable or insightful about life there than he.

thrill to the righteous indignation of " you are not like me, you are damned for all time".
</quote>

I used to emanate a similar kind of righteous indignation back in the eighties, when I was a greenish liberal myself. My particular variant was: "When Ronald Reagan's gets away with accelerating the arms race the way he does, the world is headed for a nuclear holocaust." Similarly, I've been getting comparable reactions from some of the more dogmatic liberals on this board when I discussed my views on global warming. (georgeob1 was there, so can correct me if I'm wrong.)

you, incorrectly, jump to the "liberal card" with me. i find left wing and right wing extremism equally intolerant. as for dogmatic, i reject it as a "begin all - end all" thought process. because it doesn't allow for a thought process. i personally don't subscribe to the "you are damned for all time" yip yap. from either end of the spectrum.

My point is that the kind of righteous indignation you are talking about is more similar between True Believers of any political ideology than you feel comfortable admitting. And so far, I have not seen any good evidence that there is any interesting difference between the self-righteous ideologues of the Religious Right and the self-righteousness ideologues on the Left. (Or the self-righteousness of ideological libertarians, of which we have our share just like any political philosophy.) So far, the assertions to the contrary really do seem to boil down to the "My shît don't stink" fallacy.

i believe i addressed most of your comments above. i can assure you that, everybody's stinks.

I think Thomas is more than ready for his forthcoming venture to the States.
</quote>

There are all kinds of people in the States........as evidenced by the population of a2k. I'm sure Thomas will be as unique as the rest of us in his perceptions and conclusions. One lives and learns in their own idiosyncratic way.

Just because he agrees with you, george, doesn't necessarily make him more or less ready for the States. He may find that his visits to a sample of two schools in liberal states is not sufficient information to make him ready for everything he encounters. He learns well, it seems.........so that should help him but what he learns will also be influenced by his own prejudices. Just as we all are. No one has a corner on truth.......it's all perceived truth.

You and Thomas have made me think about my fears about the Religious Right and the dangers they pose. Maybe you're right and it will all be ok if we just wait and see. But Thomas......as you note, you once worried that we'd be headed for a nuclear disaster if Reagan continued on as he was and it didn't happen........while I suspect that the fact that Clinton was in power for 8 years influenced that outcome some, it is a good point.

So we got lucky about nuclear disaster, but we didn't about the deal with the Pope and the curtailment of birth control aid to third world countries. How many young girls died in countries where they are married when they're twelve and give birth every year, often until they die, leaving motherless children behind to be ignored by the next 12 y.o. wife of their fathers? How many orphans were produced for Mother Theresa to be sainted over? God bless her vicious altrusim.

Disasters are often averted not because folks ignore the danger but rather because there are some, enough people who can look down the road and anticipate disaster, and having seen, act. I'm not in the mood to wait and see if it's going to be ok. Not when I see stories like this one every day.

Bush to resubmit judicial nominees

Picks for federal court spots could rekindle bitter battles in Senate
11:17 PM CST on Thursday, December 23, 2004

By MICHAEL A. FLETCHER and HELEN DEWAR / The Washington Post

WASHINGTON - President Bush said Thursday that he would renominate 20 people previously blocked by Senate Democrats for federal court seats, setting the stage for renewal of the bitter battles over the makeup of the federal judiciary.

The president's list includes seven appeals court candidates whose nominations were stalled on the Senate floor by Democrats, who labeled them "extremists" because of their conservative views. The others never made it to the full Senate. Buoyed by his re-election victory and a four-seat Republican gain in the Senate, Mr. Bush said he would submit the names of the nominees when the Senate returns to work in January.

Among the most prominent names on the list are Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, who was previously nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.

"The Senate has a constitutional obligation to vote up or down on a president's judicial nominees, and the president looks forward to working with the new Senate to ensure a well-functioning and independent judiciary," White House press secretary Scott McClellan said. He said 16 of the 20 people being renominated have been waiting for more than a year for a vote.

Mr. Bush's nominations promise to rekindle the contentious battles waged in the Senate over many of his judicial nominees. They will also provide a preview of the all-out fight expected whenever Mr. Bush makes an appointment for the Supreme Court.

During Mr. Bush's first term, Democrats would not allow a vote on 10 of the 52 appointments he made to fill vacancies on federal courts of appeals. The overwhelming majority of Mr. Bush's 229 judicial nominees, however, were confirmed by the Senate. In the wake of the GOP Election Day gains, conservative groups have been increasing pressure on Senate Republicans to force votes on Mr. Bush's judicial nominees. Senate Republicans are considering whether to employ a rare and highly controversial parliamentary maneuver - dubbed the "nuclear option" - to declare filibusters against judicial nominations to be unconstitutional.

With this change, nominees could be confirmed by a simple majority of 51 of the 100 senators. Now, it takes 60 votes to break a filibuster and bring the vote to the Senate floor. While Republicans have not decided whether to move ahead with this strategy, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee has made it clear he intends to end judicial filibusters "one way or another," as he put it in a recent speech.

Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he was disappointed that the White House moved so quickly to announce plans to resubmit the nominations.

"I would have preferred there would have been an interlude before they were resubmitted to provide an opportunity to improve the climate on the Judiciary Committee," Mr. Specter said in a telephone interview, referring to the bitter partisan fights on the panel over appeals court nominations during the last Congress. Mr. Specter added that he is consulting with senators of both parties in hopes of working out a bipartisan agreement for handling of judicial nominations.

Democrats face serious considerations in deciding how to react to Mr. Bush's planned nominations. Democratic senators from states Mr. Bush carried in the election could be reluctant to support maneuvers that would prevent a vote on a nomination for fear of being portrayed as obstructionist - a tactic the GOP used successfully in this year's elections.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a Judiciary Committee member, praised Mr. Bush's decision and said, "I think the American people sent a strong message on Nov. 2 against the obstructionist tactics that, unfortunately, we saw all too often in the past four years."

Mr. Cornyn served with Justice Owen on the Texas Supreme Court and said he was especially pleased that she was being nominated. "And I hope she will receive better treatment next year than she has received in the past," he said.

Justice Owen was filibustered four times. At the center of the debate was her strong anti-abortion legal views, notably in her largely unsuccessful efforts to make it difficult for teenagers to obtain abortions without parental consent.

Lola darling,

In the first place Thomas doesn't agree with me all that much, though God knows he does more often than you. My expression of his readiness had more to do with the attitudes he has demonstrated, namely a willingness to focus on facts, disagree without rancor, but, when the situation requires it, a willingness to tell the other fellow to piss off. I think you will agree these ate important survival skills in Manhattan, Washington, Chicago, L.A., and San Francisco.

I do admit that I can be a bit overbearing in argument. I like to win, and don't willingly leave my interlocutor much ground. Perhaps a bad habit, but it is a result of years of focusing on winning (that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it.). I acknowledge I have been a bit monotone in my responses to your arguments on this subject, but then so have you. I have tried to respond to the arguments you put forward. I recognize that you and I are proceeding from very different experiences of the thing and that undoubtedly colors the argument. In general, I don't so much deny the points you make, as assign them less importance than you do, and note that similar behaviors occur among people with non-religious motivations.

I'm really not nearly as dull as you accuse me of being-- at least sometimes. But you know that.
Argument leads only to impasse if it is repeated. As old Ed Fitzgerald wrote;

Myself when young did eagerly frequent
Doctor and Saint, and heard great Argument
About it and about...: but evermore
Came out by the same Door as in I went.

With them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow,
And with my own hand labour'd it to grow:
And this was all the Harvest that I reap'd--
I came like Water, and like Wind I go.

Into this Universe, and why not knowing,
Nor whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing:
And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,
I know not whither, willy-nilly blowing

O Oh, come with old Khayyam, and leave the wise
To talk; one thing is certain, that Life flies;
One thing is certain, and the Rest is Lies;
The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.

I don't know, but the World Health Organization has been tracking how often things like these are occurring. Throughout the Third World, they have been happening for all the time we have data on. And throughout the Third world, numbers are trending downward -- and that's in absolute numbers, not just as a share of the population. As best I know, the decline correlates much stronger with economic growth in the countries in question than with the prevalence of birth control measures. If you're interested, I can cite you the sources as soon as I'm back home from my Christmas vacation.

from the comments and responses i've read from you, it "appears" that your time in the u.s. centers around weeks of some number at universities. possibly more? not impossible that you are even an american living abroad. and, yes, it is arrogant of me to "assume" that i know more about you than yourself.

if i am correct about the first possibility, then i stand firmly with my assertion (which, btw, i do not mean as a personal attack), that you cannot know the full experience of daily life in america. as regards your comment about personally knowing every individual in the country; of course i don't, nobody does. (except, for some of the name dropping poseurs i meet at hollywood parties... lol ). however, i have had the privilege of traveling about most of the country and living long term in several areas. and very different places, geographical, political and religious, at that.

if you are an american living abroad, surely you understand that things change ever more rapidly in the modern world. the mood and tenor of an entire nation can change, literally overnight. 9/11 is the obvious example.even disgarding everything that's happened afterward, the events of that single day turned the american psyche on it's head. the america of 9/10 and 9/12 were and are very different countries in terms of human condition.

hopefully i've made my point clearer?

's okay. i've never noticed or believed that you're a person that is making the "facts" up. you seem to have a very tight grasp on history. that certainly deserves respect.

yes. it is up to us to, "trust, but verify", as the man said. and it is a hell of a lot of work. and even then, you have to reserve the right to change your mind if new, and "verified" information is presented. that's why i don't really go for dogma or "a party line". both are tools of manipulation to achieve someone else's agenda, imho.

now as to consequences... tempting to go for rationalizations like, "white lie" or "black lie", isn't it? but, that's probably not a fair way to go. most pointedly when "the facts" impact a group of individuals, large or small.

also, if you peddle a "bogus fact"; were you a victim of bad info? were you a victim of bad info and attempted to correct it's affect? were you a victim of bad info, and knowing that, chose to use it anyway to achieve your desires? did you just make it up and so what ? those factors, when discovered would color the consequences of your actions.

thomas, i cannot honestly say to you that i have all of the answers. i would say that in the name of fairness, the consequence should fit the deed. do i, as an individual, have the power to confer the consequence of a misdeed on a city, state or national leader? no.

do i have right and responsibility to speak up and demand an accounting for a "bogus fact" ? you bet. and if enough "individuals" speak in a united way, then the consequence of a bogus fact is more likely to be come a reality. but, even that scenario is impacted by things like the political landscape.

are we cool?

[quote]"Probably, No. 1 is judicial appointments," Viguerie says. "Many problems that we experience as a country have come about because we've had unelected judges legislating from the bench. And that needs to be corrected... We're very excited about that possibility of turning the judiciary in a more conservative direction."

Does President Bush's victory with strong support from the right mean he owes something to the conservative movement?

"I don't look at this as the president owing us," Viguerie says. "This is a president who campaigned on conservative issues, some conservative values. This president is fond of saying that he means what he says and says what he means. And so consequently, we're excited about the opportunity to help this president implement his conservative campaign promises."

Little is new about the strategic decisions PACs make or the technology at their disposal. Christian PACs have learned the tricks of the trade quickly, largely because of the mentors in the secular right.

"To a remarkable extent, the Christian activist have found skilled allies in one and only one place, among one and only one group of organizations - - the groups loosely known as the New Right" (Marshner, 1980:iii).

Two principle consultants are Paul Weyrich, National Director of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, and Howard Phillips, founder of the Conservative Caucus (Keller, 1980: 2,629).

Weyrich prompted Robert Billings to start a group in Washington to represent conservative Christians, a suggestion which led to the National Christian Action Coalition. Phillips in turn hired Edward McAteer as his field director before McAteer left to found Roundtable.

Together these four men cemented ties to most of the key evangelical preachers now in the New Christian Right (Cleninen, 1980: B7).

Richard Viguerie, direct mail expert of the New Right, credits Weyrich and Phillips with persuading ministers Jerry Falwell, Jim Robison, and Pat Robertson to get involved in convervative politics (Viguerie, 1980: 56).

Before Rush Limbaugh, there was Richard Viguerie.

Many conservatives today listen, learn, and heed the advice articulated by the radio talk show icon. But before Rush, conservatives for nearly 40 years looked to Richard Viguerie, the funding father of the conservative movement, for the "right word" on policy and politics. Before Limbaugh, it was Viguerie whose mail was delivered over hill and dale, through rain, sleet, and snow, to conservative donors and activists, prodding them to take action.

While he no longer funds an estimated 70 percent of the conservative movement's revenues - a calculation made by his political enemies - Viguerie, who turns 70 this month, no longer has to, because Viguerie-trained acolytes are active from coast to American coast. As a "graduate" of the Viguerie school of conservative activism, I attest to the influence he had, not only on U.S. politics, but on the many young men and women fortunate enough to have learned at his side. In fact, Morton Blackwell, another well-known graduate, deserves credit for the "funding father" tag.

Vigurie pioneered political "direct mail" four decades ago as the newly hired Executive Secretary for Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). Shy about personally visiting contributors, Viguerie realized he could contact 1,000 or 10,000 potential donors by mail without spending any more time, effort, or money than it would take to personally solicit a single contribution from one potential donor. Thus was launched a storied career as the guru of direct mail political fundraising.

Legions of candidates, from the courthouse to the White House, have benefited from Viguerie's expertise, and legions of others have tasted defeat as a direct result of his ability to raise money and promote action simply by sitting down at his typewriter.

This one-man financier of the U.S. Postal Service has mailed an estimated two billion letters during his careers. Some of them have been humdingers!

The "New Right" movement was kicked off in the early 1970s by a group of conservative activists which included Paul Weyrich, Joseph Coors and Richard Viguerie. It was Weyrich, founder of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, and Richard Viguerie, direct-mail/fund-raising maven, who first saw the potential of politically organizing church members from a variety of denominations around the abortion issue. It was Weyrich who brought Jerry Falwell into the fold with the formation of the Moral Majority and convinced Pat Robertson to run for president in 1988. Weyrich and Viguerie believed that social conservatives could be organized into a group that would form a constituency larger than the politically active in either the Democratic or Republican parties. Viguerie has been quoted as saying, "I organize discontent."

In 1973, Weyrich and Joseph Coors established the Heritage Foundation, a right- wing think tank, to develop public policy. Later, Weyrich established the Free Congress Foundation (FCF) to promote right-wing public policy. The Heritage Foundation and associated organizations have a hidden agenda for America. Articles written by Heritage staff members are printed in major newspapers promoting the concept that Heritage is a benign think tank, when in fact it has ties to most major right-wing activists such as: Mel &amp; Norma Gabler, who influence schoolbook selection nationally; Robert Simonds' Citizens for Excellence in Education; Mountain States Legal Foundation, an anti-environmental organization which is also against affirmative action, OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), and the ERA; and Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church. In addition to heading up Free Congress, Weyrich is also permanent Secretary and Treasurer of the Council for National Policy (CNP).

The CNP was started in 1982 as an ultra-conservative answer to the Council for Foreign Relations. Membership is by invitation only and dues are upwards of $2,000 a year. Sara Diamond, a well-known researcher of the radical religious right, describes the CNP as "a highly secretive coalition which represents the entire spectrum of New Right corporate executives, TV preachers, legislators, and former high-ranking government and military leaders. The Council for National Policy is considered the primary coordinating body - and funding conduit - for Christian Right projects." (Spiritual Warfare, Sara Diamond, South End Press, 1989.)

Other prominent CNP members are: Ralph Reed, Jr., Executive Director, Christian Coalition; Pat Robertson, Founder, Christian Coalition; Phyllis Schlafly, The Eagle Forum; James Dobson, Focus on The Family; GOP Congressman, Robert K. Dornan; GOP Congressman, William Dannemeyer; once and future GOP candidate, Oliver North; Jerry Falwell, Moral Majority; Louis P. Sheldon, Traditional Values Coalition; Burton Pines, Heritage Foundation; R. J. Rushdoony, Chalcedon, Inc.; T. Cullen Davis (Ft. Worth millionaire who was tried for the murder of his step-daughter); and Texas GOP party chairman, Tom Pauken. Recent additions to CNP membership include GOP Congressman Steve Stockman (Texas). Two well-known Houston CNP members are Ed Young, pastor of the Second Baptist Church and Judge Paul Pressler.

Free Congress Foundation has published a book entitled Cultural Conservatism: Theory and Practice (ISBN 0-942522-16-8) which was edited by William S. Lind and William H. Marshner whose wife, Connaught "Connie" Marshner, is a CNP member. The book contains chapters entitled Why the West? by William J. Bennett and Cultural Conservatism and The Conservative Movement by Paul Weyrich, in which he explores his theories including, for example, government vouchers to private citizens not only for schools but street repair and other municipal services.

In a joint publication of The Heritage Foundation, Empower America, and The Free Congress Foundation entitled The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, William Bennett, Education Secretary under Ronald Reagan, documents in alarming detail how "....violent crime has sky-rocketed; illegitimate births and divorce rates have quadrupled; teen suicide rates doubled; and scholastic aptitude test scores plummeted." Bennett warns that "....these modern day pathologies have risen from the wreckage of the Great Society - a time of booming prosperity." We must, he says, "return to the fundamental purpose of education - to engage in the architecture of souls." This book has been featured on "The Rush Limbaugh Show." Heritage Publications 1993/1994 states, "This book is required reading for anyone concerned about the future of America." Congressman Newt Gingrich is quoted in Heritage Foundation literature praising their publications.

Bennett has been chairman of FCF's National Empowerment Television (NET). According to the Anti-Defamation League's book, The Religious Right, "NET addresses the religious right's meat-and-potatoes issues - including coverage of abortion, gay rights (NET has broadcast the homophobic video, "The Gay Agenda"), school vouchers, and public school curricula developments." NET was a decisive factor in obtaining confirmation of Justice Clarence Thomas by encouraging viewers to pressure their congressmen. Burton Pines, Vice-Chairman of NET, calls the project "C-Span with an attitude."

Behind this blizzard of cultural and religious extremism is the desire of the economically greedy for a no-holds-barred laissez faire commercial climate. This group of fiscal conservatives is interested primarily in the passage of legislation which fattens their pocketbooks. They feel insulated from extremism by their individual wealth and power. They care little about the freedoms and opportunities of this or future generations.

Power hungry politicians whose primary concern is winning elections are willing to concede to extremism in their political rhetoric in order to capture the bloc votes of single-issue fanatics. By pandering to right-wing extremism, they make it possible for unrestricted commercial interests to have their day. For example, bills are being introduced to dismantle the Pure Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which stand in the way of obscene and immoral profiteering. Those with robber baron mentalities are more than willing to trade our freedoms to religious fanatics for bloc votes. Recent efforts by the newly elected conservative Congress (1995) to reduce the national deficit and balance the budget at the expense of the poor and elderly are an example. Punishing welfare mothers who have children out of wedlock by refusing aid is a precursor of what is to come. Medicare and Medicaid reductions without implementing some kind of national health care program, while insisting upon a revival of the Strategic Defense Initiative, is pure political pandering to "fat cats" in the defense industry at the expense of the weakest in our society.

Using the Council For National Policy (CNP) as its board of directors; the Free Congress Foundation (FCF) as general manager; the Christian Coalition to control the GOP and to provide congressional representation; and Pat Robertson as chaplain, the Heritage Foundation has the instruments and orchestration to implement Paul Weyrich's compositions of "Cultural Conservatism."

With FCF's National Empowerment Television (NET); right-wing talk-show radio personalities such as Rush Limbaugh; columnists like Cal Thomas; organizations such as the Christian Coalition; James Dobson's Focus On The Family; the Coalition On Revival (COR); Promise Keepers; Citizens for Excellence in Education (CEE); homophobes such as Jerry Falwell and Lou Sheldon; Christian Reconstructionists; and even anti-government militias and racist organizations, Heritage can propagandize and rally both collaborating and unsuspecting "ditto heads."

Voters with negative and/or selfish motives such as: racists (anti-Semites, skin-heads, survivalists, militias, white supremacists); anti-feminists; pro-lifers; pro-gun fanatics; home schoolers and voucher advocates fall prey to demagoguery and are being blatantly used to reduce this nation to an anti-democratic, two-class social and economic system. Diehard party supporters who ignore the demagogic positions taken and vote for the political party rather than the candidate are witless enablers in this scenario.

Ultra-conservative politicians and Christian Coalition leaders often use the expression "a city on a hill" when describing what they have in store for America. This "city on a hill" would very closely resemble medieval Europe. In medieval times, the church was the largest landholder. The church collected taxes, maintained law courts, and punished criminals and non-believers. There were two classes: the nobility, which included church leaders, and the peasants, who were bound to the land and supported the elite with their labor. This two-class system is the direction in which ultra-conservatives would take us. The radical right would first discriminate against, then exclude by law, atheists and secular humanists. Before too long, religions unwilling to bend to their brand of fanatic fundamentalism would also be excluded.

Western culture's last experience with church-dominated government lasted over 1000 years. Three factors which brought an end to this oppression were the bubonic plague, the Reformation and the rise of humanism. The plague reduced the population so severely that simple supply and demand gave opportunity to the peasant classes to participate more freely as tradesmen, artisans and soldiers. The Reformation broke the hold of one religious group (the Vatican) over all Western monarchies and subsequently weakened absolutism in governments. Humanism gave philosophic value and hope to the common man. If we allow ultra-conservatives and the Christian Coalition to continue to win ever increasing control of our government, how many years will be required to throw off the yoke? What will be the cost in lives, hope and dollars to repair the damage these greedy fanatics will do to the country? Will the United States be able to maintain its presence as a first-world country with a third-world theocratic government?

If Cultural Conservatism and the regressive economic agenda it disguises is implemented by manipulating single-issue voter groups, will your beliefs and lifestyle pass the litmus tests of these organizations? Will you lose some of your freedoms? Will your neighbor lose all of his? Will you find yourself marching in a band which has the unmistakable beat of a fascist theme underscored by the sound of jack boots?

Those who are not alarmed about the Religious Right are simply ignorant about the facts. It's a foolish man who doesn't recognize his own ignorance and seek to inform himself before speaking.

To be honest, I don't see much confusion in this thread -- on either side of the debate. I think me and George do understand what you, Bernie and the others on your side are saying -- we just happen to disagree with you. Likewise, I have every reason to expect that you guys understand what we are saying. Again, you just happen to disagree with us. It is only human to jump to the conclusion that confusion is the only reason the other side might disagree with us. But this conclusion is not generally true.

You are possibly correct, but two points on this one: 1) This is the internet, where nobody knows you're a dog. On the flip side, nobody knows you're the foremost expert in redneckology either. So, unfair as this seems, you have to convince us on the merits of your sources and your arguments -- just like anybody else does. 2) Perhaps unfairly, in the context of this thread, you don't get to decide which conclusions are false -- only which conclusions you disagree with. And when somebody reaches conclusions you disagree with, this may well be the consequence of causes other than lack of information.

Interesting signature you have there, Thomas. I actually like to decline German adjectives. Nouns, pronouns too. But my favorite is the conjugation of a verb. Lots of memorizing involved, which I do not like.....it's so illogical. Still German is an easier language than French or English, I think. I lived in Germany for a year in my youth as well.

It' true this is the internet. We don't know if you really lived in California in your childhood, but since I find a lot to respect about the way you conduct yourself and I can think of no reason why you would claim something that wasn't true, I take your word for it. Surely you know me well enough by now to give some little credence to my word. I know a lot more about this subject than anyone else on this board that I know. I have years of intimate experience.

But I agree. My word only goes so far. Still, when I give you something to study, I appreciate not getting an immediate response saying that regardless, you don't think it's a problem at all.

I do believe that you have years of intimate experience with the Religious Right. But notice the differences each of us is drawing about themselves. You conclude that having years of intimate experience makes you an expert on the Religious Right, while I deny that living in America necessarily makes one an expert on America. Suppose someone finds out the truth about me: I've never set foot into your country, I'm actually cleaning personell in our local library, and I'm only surfing the internet because my colleagues find me too incompetent to wipe the library's floor as I'm supposed to, so have decided to let me surf and do my share of the work themselves. Does this change a single point I made in this forum? No. They continue to stand on their own merits, or to fall on their face for their lack thereof. And that's exactly what I want them to do.

Honestly, my problem is that I don't like to repeat myself, and I'm running out of new arguments to make. In your latest set of 'homework', for example, you provide yet a few other piece of evidence that conservative use mass media and standard marketing techniques to advertize their agenda -- just like liberals do (they use different mass media and different standard marketing techniques, but still...) You provide yet another set of evidence that the Heritage Foundation and friends have a hidden agenda to roll back the Great Society and the New Deal. An agenda so secret its out on the Web for everyone to see, and which is published in an array of well-selling books, some of which are named by your source. Finally, you treat yet another opinion piece as if it were a reliable source of primary information, perhaps not noticing that this only has an effect when you're preaching to the converted.

I have raised my objections to each of these points earlier in this thread and elsewhere. I really don't know what to answer anymore. Okay, maybe one thing you might find helpful is a pointer to a liberal poster who routinely succeeds in persuading me of his political points here, and to a lesser degree georgeob1 too. It's nimh. Maybe you can improve your effectiveness by observing the way he backs up his claims with evidence, and adjust your debating strategy as needed.

Hume not only wrote many political essays, but applied for chairs at two universities. Add in the projects he undertook in philosophy and one would have some trouble arguing convincingly that Hume would need a shotgun to his head to involve himself in contemporary issues or contemporary groups, particularly regarding the issues of religious dogma gaining greater foothold in the community or in the machinations of rule.
</quote>

I'm sorry, but you're bashing a strawman. None of this refutes the claim you are attacking, which was:

<quote orig_author="Thomas">
If forced at gunpoint to choose between the ACLU and the Religious Right, I'm sure he would rather join the ACLU. But his obvious preference of reasoning over bullying seems so intense to me that he wouldn't have joined either organization unless forced at gunpoint. I guess he'd rather have an Op-Ed column in the New York times. I can see him blog, too. I am fairly certain he would have preferred turning people around by persuading them rather than through political pressure.
</quote>

Or in other words: Contrary to your assertion, I am not denying that Hume, if he lived today, would "involve himself in contemporary issues". I just don't think that joining a political pressure group would have been his preferred way of involving himself politically. While I found it interesting to learn that Hume applied for chairs at two universities, I don't see how this supplies evidence against my point, since universities weren't thought of as political pressure groups at the time -- as well they shouldn't.

thomas
How could I...why would I...construct a strawman to stand in when you don't make an argument, you simply voice an opinion regarding how you think Hume would behave in this context? That's not an opinion I share and you haven't presented anything like a compelling case. Your certainty doesn't do the trick.
What I was pointing to however was your use of the metaphor 'with gun to head', as if it were the case or even likely that Hume would pay our imagined choice more than a few seconds' perusal. This may well be a description of how thomas might behave but not, in my view, how Hume would be expected to act. This isn't resolveable.

<quote orig_author="blatham">
How many anti-nuke individuals or environmentalists sought to gain power, though organization and activism, in thousands of school and hospital boards?
</quote>

I am judging from my experience in two highschools, one near Chicago, one in a small university town in Oregon, each of which I visited for about two weeks. I admit this is an unimpressive statistical sample. But for what it's worth, the biology curriculum in both schools taught a version of ecology that came pretty close to Gaia worship. In the geography lessons, the textbook of both schools, and in the classroom teaching of one of them, Cuba under Batista was portrayed as a Third World country, and Cuba under Castro was portrayed as a successful effort in bringing a Third World country up to speed with the industrial nations. It was also said in the textbooks that the world was facing an overpopulation crisis and that measures in the spirit of China's one-child policy were the right way to counter it. Sure, the price of forced abortions and sterilizations seemed high to the Westerner, but hey -- who are we to impose our values on other cultures? Overall, China was made to look a lot better in the Geography textbook than the Pope, who was portrayed as an old fool for disagreeing with policies to tie development aid to implementation of population-control policies.

Don't ask me how they did it, but it seems the environmentalists and socialists did a pretty good job at pushing their agenda into school curriculuae, contrary to the facts of the matter.

In addition to that, I don't think the EPA would have been incorporated without political pressure from environmentalist pressure groups like Ralph Naders. Nor do I believe it would have grown to its current size without that influence. Do you? While I agree that the left-wing pressure groups didn't coopt the political institutions the way the right-wingers did. But they were successful at coopting different institutions, and I stand by my judgment that their political success was comparable to that of the Religious Right: substantial, but limited.

Your reluctance or refusal to acknowledge differences here as being anything more than superficial in their consequences is where your dogmatism shows, thomas. It's not the first time. On an earlier discussion, I relayed the text of a Britannica entry on the United Fruit Growing Company and your response to that bit of ugly, anti-democratic American history of collusion between state and a corporate interest was dismissed as being probably written by a leftist. If I were to gather up the figures for the exact number of school boards in the US and Canada which have been targeted by the Christian Right to the end - successful end - of gaining voting control, and even if that number was in the many hundreds (it is), you'd argue 'so what?'. If I added in the number of hospital boards and riding associations and court appointments and state positions and federal positions, it wouldn't much matter what those figures might be...nor how utterly different in comparison (in organization and in result) from what the environmental or womens' movements, for example, achieved, I'm quite confident you'd find nothing noteworthy about those differences. Left vs right, activism equals activism...ho hum. Like foxfyre in her defence of pragmatic torture, it becomes hard to imagine what set of circumstances might encourage thomas to acknowledge that what is maybe ain't what ought to be - and WHY it ought not to be.

Who can tell us more that is 'true' about love, the bio-chemist or the poet? Who can better discern the 'truth' of political movements and consequences, Milton Friedman or George Orwell?
</quote>

I'd say that depends on what you want to know about the phenomenon in question. For example, if you want to know what it was like to live through the Great Depression, Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath and Orwell's Road to Wigan Pier are hard to beat. But both are unreliable sources if you want to know what caused the Great Depression, and how we as a society can prevent a new one. To this end, Keynes' "General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" will get you much farther. Milton Friedman's Monetary History of the United States is better still, but it's not a fair comparison. Friedman wrote in the fifties, not the thiries, so had access to information that the other three didn't.

Likewise, I wouldn't be surprised if Tom Wolfe writes the definitive novel about the Religious Right some day, and if it will tell us exactly what it feels like to be part of it, and what it feels like to be missionized by it. But if I want to reach an informed judgment on what its likely impact will be and what, if anything, I ought to do about it, I'll trust peer-reviewed sociologists, economists and ethnologists over novelists hands-down. The former sell their texts on their strength in figuring out facts, the latter merely sell their text on their strength in writing entertaining fiction.

1984 or Animal Farm have as their singular strength the quality of 'entertainment'? Do you think it so?

Thomas,

I've never said it was secret. It's georgeob who keeps saying I've said that. Of course it's on the web, where else would I be able to find information I could use for demonstrating the influence the Far Right has had on American politics? It's interesting.......in your argument you say you can't be convinced unless I provide unbiased proof. And yet if the reports are there to be read, you say they have no merit because they're not secret. I'm not claiming they're secret.......although they have been strategically manulipulated as the New Right learns new techniques......I'm saying they've been influencial and they're dangerous.

Consider for a moment if I know and have known many of the people involved in the organizing efforts of the Far Right. You of course don't know for sure if I do or not. I don't know if you're a janitor in some library either. But if you are, you're a damned intelligent janitor.....so who cares what you do to make a living? I can tell from your posts that you know a lot about many things. You don't strike me as a liar and I know people who have met you in person. So I have an idea about how dependable your word probably is. You're probably not a janitor.

Does this change a single point you've made in this forum? Yes it does. To the extent you're evaluating how dangerous a situation is, to that extent you need experience with the situation to make such a judgement accurately.

Those people, unfamiliar with a Tsunami, who ran toward the wave or just stood there in wonder were less capable of evaluating what they should be doing to protect themselves than were those who knew what was coming next. That's where you are on this subject, Thomas. Surely you're not arguing that a person without knowledge is just as capable of evaluating danger as one who is.

I won't try to tell you about your areas of experience of which I am ignorant, and you shouldn't expect me to value your conclusions about mine.

It's as if you and george are in a museum, let's say, the MOMA. You're observing the paintings on exhibit. And you both agree that a monkey could have painted this or that work of art. As far as you know, it looks as if the painting is random. You see no evidence of technique.

Whenever I hear a person announce their conviction that they could have painted it themselves, I always wonder how they can be so sure, having never studied visual arts or more specifically modern art in their lives. I always think I would consider their opinion if they had first been curious about what makes others consider the painting to be art.

If you haven't met these guys (New Right leaders) yourself, if you've never been to their churches or been out to dinner with them, lived in their homes, you might try to find those who have and ask about their experience with them before presuming to announce how organized the New Right is or how much we should try to do to stop them.

So I'll consider your opinion that there's nothing to worry about as worthy of my attention when you've done your homework, however you choose to do it. And I recognize, as you seem not to, that your ability to be as informed as a person who has close knowledge is limited for now. So therefore, I know that while your arguments are logical as far as they go, they are still uninformed in significant enough ways as to qualify your conclusions to be false.

I am hopeful as you are that our democracy is strong enough to manage the influence of the New Right over time. But the short term (the next 50 years) will be devastating for those caught in the middle. Unless the Dems can find a way to block it, the Far Right will now have a strong influence in the courts. Whether they can overturn Roe V. Wade, I don't know. But I never thought I'd have to worry about it actually happening. And I'm worried. I hope it can be avoided. But you'll excuse me if I don't share wholeheartedly your optimism.

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A35064-2004Dec29?language=printer">All they want is a ticket to the Inauguration</a>

BIRD-IN-HAND, Pa.

Early on a pale blue morning, a horse-drawn buggy clop-clopped along a farmland stretch of Route 340. A lone little Chevy compact came toward it at a Sunday pace.

From an intersection, a black SUV the size of an Indian elephant barreled up to the buggy's back, passing with a quick jerk that nearly clipped the oncoming car -- and the horse's nose.

That's Pennsylvania's Amish country, where the 19th and 21st centuries coexist, commingle and collide on a regular basis. The Amish may hold fast to their plain ways, rejecting cars, indoor electricity, home phones and televisions. But contact with the outside world is unavoidable. Malls stand on land where corn used to grow, tourists run around the village streets, and even the old unspoken rule -- leave the Amish alone -- is gone, left in the dust of the presidential campaign, when the Republicans came calling for votes.

Yes, the Republicans, true to their vow to leave no vote unwooed, came to Lancaster County hoping to win over the famously reclusive Old Order Amish -- who shun most modern ways -- along with their slightly less-strict brethren, the Mennonites. Democrats laughed at the very idea. The Amish had no use for politics. Were the Republicans that desperate? But the GOP effort, underscored by President Bush's meeting with some Amish families in early July, did the trick.

"Yup, we voted this time," said an elder Old Order Amish man approached at his home-based quilt shop on Route 340. He had a beard that straggled down to his chest and bright blue eyes. His first name, he said, is Amos, but in keeping with the Amish edict against calling attention to oneself, he would not give his last name.

"I didn't vote for the last 30 years," he said, puffing on a pipe. "But Bush seemed to have our Christian principles."

Outside looking in, it makes sense that the Amish would pay little attention to national politics. They have their own schools (formal education for eight years), their own churches (or religious gatherings, at one another's homes) and their own rules. This has worked for them. The population of Amish and Mennonites, at more than 20,000 in Lancaster County, keeps growing.

But it seems the outside world, the "English" world, as the Amish call it, has been creeping in too closely for the plain people not to worry. In recent months, reports of child abuse in Amish country have made local papers and national news. The reality show "Amish in the City" has brought a slew of curiosity seekers asking all kinds of questions. (Do you take showers? Read newspapers? Ride buses? Yes, yes and yes.) And the plain people have daily worries as well. "We've been worrying about liquor and beer being sold in the grocery stores," said Sam, a gazebo maker and writer who said he would "get into trouble" if his last name was printed.

"We were down," Sam said, "and when the president visited, it cheered us right up. We got a firsthand look at him, and it really warmed our hearts."

In short, as Sam and half a dozen other Amish men explained (women were hard to find, and harder to talk to), Bush won votes with a time-honored campaign convention: He showed up. On July 9 his campaign bus rolled down Route 340, hoping to fire up the base in Republican Lancaster County. The Amish, watching the spectacle from the road, became part of it.

"We came out," Amos said. "We were about 70 people. One of his security said he wanted to meet us and invited us to meet with him across the road at Lapp's Electric."

"They knew we didn't like publicity," said Amos, smiling at the recollection. "So the president met with us all in an office at Lapp's. He shook everyone's hand -- even the littlest ones in their mother's arms -- and he told us all he hoped we would exercise our right and vote."

Did Bush ask them to vote for him?

"Nope," Amos said. "That's another thing we liked about him."

Not to mention, the 4,000 Republican volunteers who blanketed Lancaster County for months and visited the fairs and farm auctions in Amish country talking up the president's Christian values. That helped them think abortion might be outlawed, Sam said. Thinking of Bush's Christian values even helped with their questions about the carnage in Iraq.

And so, while Bush lost Pennsylvania by more than 120,000 votes, he nearly halved his losing margin from 2000. In large part, that was because of the GOP's push among rural voters. Here in Lancaster County, where the party set a goal of besting the Democrat by 70,000 votes (or about 10,000 more than in 2000), Bush ended up winning by 70,896. Several hundred of those votes came from men in suspenders and black suits and women in bonnets and wide-skirt black dresses. Republicans registered more than 300 new voters in each of three mostly Amish districts. In Leacock Township, the GOP nearly doubled its voter rolls, from 1,000 to 1,800, with all but a handful of the new voters being Amish or Mennonite.

Just as everyone predicted the plain folks would not vote, the postmortems all suggested the Amish vote was a fluke. Amos -- another Amos, who sells wooden toys and other Amish crafts at a roadside stand -- said that bothers him. He could see more plain people voting next time, he said, "for another candidate with good morals."

Sam, the carpenter-journalist, had read reports suggesting that the GOP manipulated the Amish. That did not sit well at all. "They didn't come here just recruiting the Amish," he said. "They were trying to get anybody to vote."

The Amish, in turn, voted with pure hearts, he said, asking for nothing in return.

Or almost nothing.

"We're trying to get tickets for the inauguration," he said. "Do you know how to go about getting those?"

Did the article say anything about manipulating the Amish? I didn't see it if it did. I'm getting old and my memory fails me from time to time, but I don't remember reading it in the article.

What the New Right has done is neither totally secret nor is it illegal. But for those of us who value reason over superstition, what they have done is dangerous and alarming. Yes, it bothers me JW, as it should anyone without blinders or with a commitment to reason.

It's a culture war and those of us who value civil rights are losing. Those who believe coercion is a valid method are in control.

Either Encyclopedia Britannica can't agree with itself what to make of the United Fruit Company, or they have changed their entry in a direction favorable to my politics, and unfavorable to yours. Here is <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9074288&amp;query=united%20fruit%20growing%20company&amp;ct=eb">the Encyclopedia Britannica article</a> in full length:

<quote orig_author="The Encyclopedia Britannica">
United Brands Company:

American corporation formed in 1970 in the merger of United Fruit Company and AMK Corporation (the holding company for John Morrell and Co., meat-packers). It engages in the production and distribution of bananas and other fruits and produce, the processing and distribution of meats, the manufacture and distribution of other foods, fats, oils, and beverages, and the administration of diversified activities in plastics, animal feeds, telecommunications, and other areas. Headquarters for United Brands are in New York City.

United Fruit Company, the main company, was founded in 1899 in the merger of the Boston Fruit Company and other companies producing and marketing bananas grown in the Caribbean islands, Central America, and Colombia. The principal founder was Minor C. Keith, who had begun to acquire banana plantations and to build a railroad in Costa Rica as early as 1872. In 1884 he contracted with the Costa Rican government to fund the national debt and to lay about 50 more miles of track. In return he received, for 99 years, full rights to these rail lines and 800,000 acres (325,000 hectares) of virgin land, tax exempt for 20 years.

United Fruit Company was capitalized at $11,230,000 at its founding. The company then expanded its capitalization to $215,000,000 by 1930 by absorbing more than 20 rival firms, and it became the largest employer in Central America. From the time the company began, Caribbean and Latin-American governments made available vast undeveloped tracts of jungle lands, which United Fruit cleared, planted, and supplied with extensive railroad and port facilities. Marketing operations included a shipping arm, the Great White Fleet, one of the largest of private merchant navies. All these efforts were matched by an advertising campaign that was extremely successful in marketing bananas in North America and Europe.

As a foreign corporation of conspicuous size, United Fruit sometimes became the target of popular attacks. The Latin-American press often referred to it as el pulpo ("the octopus"), accusing it of exploiting labourers, bribing officials, and influencing governments during the period of Yankee "dollar diplomacy" in the first decades of the 20th century. The company's defenders, however, have pointed out that United Fruit's early excesses were somewhat mitigated later. Through the Associated Producers Program, the company gradually transferred title of portions of its landholdings to individual growers, provided them with reasonable credit terms and technological assistance, and acted as marketing agent for their produce; its workers were comparatively well paid and were provided with medical care.

United Brands still owns or leases extensive banana plantations in Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, and Colombia. It also has continued to produce, for the U.S. government, Jamaican sugar; Costa Rican, Panamanian, and Ecuadorian cocoa; and abaca in Guatemala. Throughout Central America and northern South America, it has maintained holdings that produced tropical woods, quinine, essential oils, and rubber.

See? It doesn't say that there was an ugly bit of anti-democratic politics. Only that popular opinion in Latin America often disliked the United Fruit Company. The article takes no position on whether public opinion was correct.

The Heritage Foundation and associated organizations have a hidden agenda for America. Articles written by Heritage staff members are printed in major newspapers promoting the concept that Heritage is a benign think tank, when in fact it has ties to most major right-wing activists such as: Mel &amp; Norma Gabler, who influence schoolbook selection nationally; Robert Simonds' Citizens for Excellence in Education; Mountain States Legal Foundation, an anti-environmental organization which is also against affirmative action, OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), and the ERA; and Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.

This is bull manure because the Heritage Foundation is openly opposed to environmental protection laws, opposed to affirmative action, supportive of voucherizing the school system, and of laissez-faire economic policies in general. And that's just the position they take in the "articles in major newspapers" mentioned above. The only reason I can think of why its opponents talk of a "hidden agenda" is because conspiracy theories without are boring and unpersuasive without a secret plot. But the plot is not secret. And if you don't think it's secret either, you shouldn't refer to articles which say it is. May I suggest that you read your own sources before accusing your opponents of not doing their homework?

In his book "Bobos in Paradise" David Brooks cites Francis Fukuyama's book The Great Disruption :

<quote>
Instead of community arising as a byproduct of rigid belief, people will return to religious belief
because of their desire for community. In other words, people will return to religious tradition not
necessarily because they accept the truth of revelation, but because the absence of community and
the transience of social ties in the secular world makes them hungry for ritual and cultural tradition.
They will help the poor or their neighbors not because doctrine tells them they must, but rather
because they want to serve their communities and find that faith-based organizations are the most
effective ways of doing so. They will repeat ancient prayers and reenact age-old rituals not because
they believe they were handed down by God, but rather because they want their children to have
proper values, and because they want to enjoy the comfort of ritual and the sense of shared
experience it brings. In a sense they will not be taking religion seriously on its own terms. Religion
becomes a source of ritual in a society that has been stripped bare of ceremony, and thus a
reasonable extension of the natural desire for social relatedness with which all human beings are born
</quote>

This, of course, is the great insight of the Nazis and the Communists : that by providing social forms and rituals and activities which make the citizenry feel that they are a part of something, you can co-opt them into even evil pursuits. Modern religions are increasingly willing to adapt their doctrines to suit their least serious adherents. They are left with the structure of religion, but it has been drained of any substance. The great term that Brooks borrows from a rabbi in Montana is "flexidoxy." Religion is so flexible that it no longer requires anything of practitioners beyond participation, good will, voluntarism and charity. An organization which takes no cognizance of the soul, merely asking that parishioners engage in certain activities, is a religion in name only.

For goodness sakes, thomas. I'll forgive you your crappy memory and I'll forgive myself for being too lazy to find this previous discussion we had. But I don't think I'll forgive the rather shallow attempt to sort out the history here.

The benign entry (actually it is so ahistorical as to be worthless) you've pulled up is not the one I forwarded earlier. I also mentioned David Halberstam's book "the fifties" and the PBS documentary based on it as a source of information (I likely linked it, but not sure). I mentioned the interview on that show with the CIA chief who was in charge of the operation which successfully removed - at the behest of the UFC - a democratically elected government, and I mentioned the US government principles responsible and some of their personal financial connections to the UFC. Try this, from Wikipedia as a starting point for your further reading.

<quote>
The United Fruit Company owned vast tracts of land in Central America, and sometimes the Company was said to be the real power in control of those nations, the national governments doing the Company's bidding. The Company several times overthrew governments which they considered insufficiently compliant to Company will. For example, in 1910 a ship of armed hired thugs was sent from New Orleans to Honduras to install a new president by force when the incumbent failed to grant the Fruit Company tax breaks. The newly installed Honduran president granted the Company a waiver from paying any taxes for 25 years.

The Company had a mixed record of encouraging and discouraging development in the nations it was involved in. For example, in Guatemala the Company built schools for the people who lived and worked on Company land, while at the same time for many years prevented the Guatemalan government from building highways, because this would lessen the profitable transportation monopoly of the railroads, which were owned by United Fruit. A popular name for the company was Mamá Yunay ("Mommy United").

In order to administer its far-flung operations, United Fruit became a major developer of radio technology, which it later pooled with other companies to form the Radio Corporation of America.

The Guatemalan government of Colonel Jacobo Arbenz Guzman was toppled by covert action by the United States government in 1954 at the behest of United Fruit because of Arbenz Guzman's plans to redistribute uncultivated land owned by the United Fruit Company among Indian peasants. The UFC and the bankers that supported it convinced the CIA and President Dwight Eisenhower that this was the first sign of a Communist takeover in Central America. The US Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, was a determined anti-Communist whose law firm had represented United Fruit. His brother Allen Dulles was the director of the CIA. The brother of the Assistant Secretary of State for InterAmerican Affairs, John Moors Cabot, had once been president of United Fruit. Guzman's government was overthrown by Guatemalan army officers invading from Honduras. As many as 100,000 people may have died in the ensuing civil war.

Of course, I didn't use the term 'pigheaded'. I said you were 'dogmatic'. It's a charge you and I have leveled at each other (or, certainly, have both implied) a few times previously. You hold to a principle of governance which maintains that state 'interference' will most often produce effects that hurt the overall good more than they forward overall good. With certain caveats, I think your principle deeply counter-factual and one that serves the selfish or amoral and the powerful - at the cost of much suffering to those not in such a priviledged and aristocratic category - far too often to be morally acceptable. The UFC case is a paradigm. Another such contemporary case is suggested in the big winners for bucks in Iraq...Boeing and Northrup/Grumman (fuk the uncivilized colored people with the false god...there's big bucks to be made from war... <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/wire/2005/01/01/fraud/index.html">http://www.salon.com/news/wire/2005/01/01/fraud/index.html</a> )

Well then, it's not terribly clear what you are saying or why you bothered to say it. Uninteresting books don't sell? The context of this particular disagreement, if that is what it is, was my suggestion that a book such as animal farm or 1984 contain a particular and real species of 'truth', and that statistical analyses of any human endevor can and often do miss such truths. I framed the rhetorical question "who has a better take on the truth about 'love', the biochemist or the poet?"

To frame another one, "Who has a better take on movements or political trends that ought to be thought potentially dangerous (that is, dangerous to liberty, freedom, democracy), George Orwell or an accountant?"

It's a culture war. Those who see the futility of legislating morality will ultimately prevail. While this author is not so sure of my conclusions, he defines the demographics clearly, in an opinion peise referencing Ruy Teixeira and John B. Judis's The Emerging Democratic Majority.

<quote>
"Victory through demography" is the premise behind Teixeira and Judis's The Emerging Democratic Majority. The premise rests on two key facts. First, the Democratic party has done historically well among certain segments of the American population: Hispanics, college-educated women, and secularists. Second, these are the population segments that are growing the fastest--and will, in time, overwhelm Republican constituencies.

Is it true? The authors present a compelling case: The country's fastest growing ethnic group is Hispanics, who account for two-fifths of the country's annual population increase. In 2000, Hispanics voted for Al Gore over George W. Bush 62 percent to 35. The country's fastest-growing education group is women with college degrees. According to the Census Bureau, the percent-age of women with at least a bachelor's has leaped from an asterisk at mid-century to over a quarter today. In 2000, college-educated women voted for Gore over Bush 57 percent to 39. And what about the third group, secularists? They're the country's fastest-grow-ing religious identification when defined as those who rarely or never attend church. According to the National Opinion Research Center, they've jumped from 18 to 30 percent of the population in 25 years. Secularists supported Gore by double-digit margins.

These statistics are very depressing for rank-and-file Republicans. But there is one final piece of nasty demo-graphic news that must be shared. The country's fastest-growing economic class--professionals--is also swinging to the Democratic party. The professionals are white-collar, highly trained, credentialed people such as teachers, engineers, architects, computer analysts, and physicians. They're more than one-fifth of the electorate. They're highly educated, financially successful, and they used to be Republicans. But there's no sign they're coming back.

In sum, the message of The Emerging Democratic Majority to the Republican party is: Your cause is doomed! Our Harvard Law School grads and Latino landscapers will swamp your Fox News viewers and Federalist Society members!

<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0210.baer.html">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0210.baer.html</a>

I share (what I believe to be) Thomas' optimism about the future of the political landscape. Ultimately reason will prevail.......it's the harm to those caught in the middle now that I'm concerned about.

If morality could be legislated effectively, I still don't believe I'd support it on ethical grounds. However there's a problem of practicality as well. Legislated morality produces weak conformists. The fact that they are "moral" out of duty to a rule is an oxymoronic vulnerability. (claiming poetic licence here) It's an Achilles heal shaped like a target. So I object to the idea as viable both on ethical grounds as well as on pragmatic concerns. Ultimately the legislation of morality will produce morally bankrupt acolytes, poor warriors in the Culture Wars........but more importantly not to be depended on for decisions which require a true morality.

But the article I "pulled up" is the article in the current Encyclopedia Britannica about the United Fruit company -- which I feel is the appropriate article to consult. If you posted an earlier version of the same article, this may well mean that the editors of Britannica themselves found the history described in your version inaccurate, and felt it would improve their article if they "sorted out their history".

Strangely enough, I have exactly the same feelings about your views in this matter. American 20th century examples of why I feel this way include the throwing of firebombs on a Philadelphia slum ordered by the major of Philadelphia in the 1980s. The harrassment of the civil rights movement by various state governments -- including the repeated imprisonment of Martin Luther King. The coercion of unwilling bus company owners to segregate their buses. The testing in the 1950s of the effects of radioactive fallout on unsuspecting Nevada citizens who had the misfortune of living downwind from a testing ground for atomic bombs. The deliberate infection of poor blacks with lethal infectious diseases for the purpose of clinically testing antidotes in their experimental stage, which also happened in the 1950s. The attempted shutting up of the New York Times who wanted to tell how the Vietnam War really started. The criminalization of homosexuality, and of interracial marriage. The War on Drugs. The PATRIOT Act. The Defense of Marriage Act. Do we agree that these cases provide arguments against your position that more government is generally the solution, not the problem, or do you need more?

Okay, let me try again. In my opinion, "1984" and "Animal farm" were both good descriptions of what it's like to live under, or be part of, a totalitarian government. But 1984 was not good prophecy of how the Britain of 1984 would actually look like. "Animal Farm" avoids this problem by moving the story from the real world into the realm of a fable. They are both thoughtful and entertaining to read, which I think is the reason they were bestsellers. But neither of them has much interesting to say what causes governments to go totalitarian, and what steps might be taken to avoid it. For that, I much prefer The Road to Serfdom, published around the same time by Friedrich Hayek, an economist. Sorry, I can't think of any accountants who contributed outstanding work on the question. (And needless to say, I'm happy we can read both Hayek and Orwell, so don't actually have to decide between them)

Lola chides others for the constancy of their responses to her own unvarying claims that there is a dangerous conspiracy of Christian religious zealots, presumably mostly evangelicals, who, in alliance with another amorphous group of "new Right" Neocons are out to very bad things - though it is sometimes hard to figure out just what.

Blatham is fixed on the evils of corporations and Republican government in the United States. (Perhaps the Canadian - or French -- versions of both are beyond reproach.) He trots out the standard litany of left-wing diatribes against the United Fruit Company and the evils done by it and the U.S. government to the hapless peasants of Guatemala (who, left to themselves, were clearly on the verge of creating a prosperous democratic paradise), as evidence of the need to suppress such evils through the adoption of more powers in the hands of government which he presumably would populate with Platonic philosopher kings.

Thomas responds, noting the mixed bag of good and evil done at the hands of both government and corporations, acknowledging the zealotry of some religious right, but noting that it is often no worse than other ubiquitous sources of that commodity. In various ways, he suggests that he rejects formulaic authoritarian answers and prefers instead the free markets of individual choice in economic and political life: even though they too create or tolerate some undesirable things, they do so generally less than the alternatives. George, silently applauds (OK, not silently).

Neither Blatham nor Lola has offered any reliable - or believable - means to the achievement of the ends implied in their criticisms. After they wipe out right wing Christians, Neocons, most U.S. corporations, and (presumably) the Republican Party, what next? Will crime, conflict, and suffering cease? Will the authoritarian structures required in accomplishing all this, themselves, remain immune to bad action or intent? Surely Aesop had something to say about this.

Young women will be able to get an abortion when it is unfortunately necessary without jeopardizing their lives. Religion will become the personal matter it should be and out of the schools and other places owned and needed by the entire population.....regardless of their beliefs re religion, to name a couple off the top of my head. Hopefully reason will gain in popularity as a guide to dealing with the inevitable conflict and suffering endemic to mankind. This is my hope.

Of course crime, conflict and suffering will not cease. Your Gingrich technique* is annoying, george, but I think I've said that already........I wonder why you don't seem to get the message. Going dull on us in your old age? Or is it that you're a one trick pony? It's you that keeps using the word conspiracy. I've said it's a planned political action, often with agendas, if not hidden, at least disguised or not emphasized. Candidates for local school boards......delegates to the GOP convention, etc.

acknowledging the zealotry of some religious right, but noting that it is often no worse than other ubiquitous sources of that commodity
</quote>

Neither "no worse" nor "ubiquitous" has anything to do with my point. The extremists are in a position to greatly influence the courts for decades to come. If you truly value "the free markets of individual choice in economic and political life" you should be concerned. This group, not the other ubiquitous ones, have a highly influential and determinative position in government at this moment and you must not know them or you'd be worried too. You're either arguing from an ignorant position or you're evil and stupid....I prefer to think the former.

My point is not related to the fact that other groups may and undoubtedly will be hazardous to the health of the nation in the future. There are lots of extremists wherever man exists. That's obvious and I dislike your caricature of me as being so naive or dumb as to believe otherwise. My point is that this group has gained power and influence now. And concerned citizens should be taking heed. I don't think you misunderstand what I'm saying. I'm not sure why you insist on the Gingrich imitation. But I'd appreciate it if you would stop it.......it doesn't further the discussion.

*The Gingrich method: you over simplify my ideas, use adjectives and nouns with negative and misleading connotations for the apparent purpose of devaluing my arguments.

If by "the history here" you mean the history of the United Fruit Company, you may be relieved to hear that I have just ordered a copy of Banana Wars: Power, Production, and History in the Americas, edited by Steve Striffler and Mark Morberg. Unlike any of the sources you and I have provided so far, it comes from researchers who have a reputation to lose in the field, and it has been peer-reviewed. I'll let you know what they say in a few weeks.

That book does indeed look interesting. At the same time, might I recommend Halberstam's "The Fifties". When you do get back to this issue, please address the 'charges' made in the Wikipedia piece (another, from Halberstam, is that within weeks of the CIA-manipulated coup of the democratically elected government and replacement by a military junta effectively controlled by the CIA and UFC, the four or five top labor leaders in the country had been murdered).
As regards the peer-review process...one of the reasons I enjoy talking with you is your understanding of the critical importance of that process in academic publishing and, more generally, our shared notion that books/essays etc ought to provide source citations on claims made such that readers can verify.

<quote>
If by "the history here", you mean the history of our debate, I'm not trying to "sort it out". I believe that you posted a more condemning article, and that I believe you that I have labeled it as 'probably written by a leftist'. But the article I "pulled up" is the article in the current Encyclopedia Britannica about the United Fruit company -- which I feel is the appropriate article to consult. If you posted an earlier version of the same article, this may well mean that the editors of Britannica themselves found the history described in your version inaccurate, and felt it would improve their article if they "sorted out their history". Your grudge may well be with your own source, not with me.
</quote>

No, I meant the history of the coup above. It may be that the encyclopedia entry I provided was not from Britannica but from another publisher. Regardless, the information is available in many other places.

Strangely enough, I have exactly the same feelings about your views in this matter. American 20th century examples of why I feel this way include the throwing of firebombs on a Philadelphia slum ordered by the major of Philadelphia in the 1980s. The harrassment of the civil rights movement by various state governments -- including the repeated imprisonment of Martin Luther King. The coercion of unwilling bus company owners to segregate their buses. The testing in the 1950s of the effects of radioactive fallout on unsuspecting Nevada citizens who had the misfortune of living downwind from a testing ground for atomic bombs. The deliberate infection of poor blacks with lethal infectious diseases for the purpose of clinically testing antidotes in their experimental stage, which also happened in the 1950s. The attempted shutting up of the New York Times who wanted to tell how the Vietnam War really started. The criminalization of homosexuality, and of interracial marriage. The War on Drugs. The PATRIOT Act. The Defense of Marriage Act. Do we agree that these cases provide arguments against your position that more government is generally the solution, not the problem, or do you need more?
</quote>

Yes, I do understand that you see my position as ahistorical or counter-factual as I find yours. Our personal histories may well offer up some explanation to that curiosity. As regards your examples above, any one of them would have to be taken separately. But, for example, where you'd probably see the purposive infection of unsuspecting blacks as being an act of the state, I would argue it as a predictable consequence of human greed instantiated in much corporate behavior which the state (in collusion) FAILS TO INHIBIT OR POLICE. Human 'evil' did not originate with the rise of community political structures. But such structures (eg the courts, codified laws, etc) are not something you and I would like to be suddenly without.

Well then, it's not terribly clear what you are saying or why you bothered to say it.

Okay, let me try again. In my opinion, "1984" and "Animal farm" were both good descriptions of what it's like to live under, or be part of, a totalitarian government. But 1984 was not good prophecy of how the Britain of 1984 would actually look like. "Animal Farm" avoids this problem by moving the story from the real world into the realm of a fable. They are both thoughtful and entertaining to read, which I think is the reason they were bestsellers. But neither of them has much interesting to say what causes governments to go totalitarian, and what steps might be taken to avoid it. For that, I much prefer The Road to Serfdom, published around the same time by Friedrich Hayek, an economist. Sorry, I can't think of any accountants who contributed outstanding work on the question. (And needless to say, I'm happy we can read both Hayek and Orwell, so don't actually have to decide between them)
</quote>

I don't think any Orwell scholar (or close reader) holds that 1984 was prophesy of how England might turn out in that year. It's a popular notion, but seems to be quite wrong. The final two digits, you'll note, are reversed from when he wrote it. Orwell didn't do prophesy, he did social and political observation and commentary.

What does Hayek say about the uses of propaganda? About how we might identify it? Or about the effectiveness of the passive voice in dispelling admission of agency? What can he offer us as signposts or red flags that a society or government which condones torture and revoking of civil liberties is quite possibly on its way to something far worse? What does Hayek say about the dangers of organized information control by the state and its agents? Does he mention that when all are equal but pigs are more equal than cats, then we have a pig problem?

Dear Lola,

I had not known it as the "Gingrich technique", but I do recognize it from the posts of many here - including myself on occasion, and yours and Blatham's as well.

I promise to work hard to focus on the finer points of distinction between "conspiracy" and, "a planned political action, often with agendas, if not hidden, at least disguised or not emphasized. Candidates for local school boards......delegates to the GOP convention, etc."

<quote>
You're either arguing from an ignorant position or you're evil and stupid....I prefer to think the former.
</quote>

Well, you don't leave me any attractive options here. Take out the somewhat gracious last phrase, and it would be worthy of my pal Frank Apisa.

I believe there is a third option you left out. Namely that I believe the so-called religious right are no more extreme or powerful than other antagonistic groups in the US political scene, and that they are far more likely to be self-limiting than some of their opponents. Moreover I generally agree with (most of) the policies of this Administration, and believe they strike a political/policy chord that is both needed and otherwise missing from the world political scene. Finally, I believe that many of their international opponents (mostly those in Europe) are not opposed to us so much because they oppose our current policies as they oppose us because it is their policy to oppose us.

Again, I don't deny the truth of your assertions so much as the importance you give them. I readily acknowledge the superiority of your knowledge and, perhaps, understanding of some of these groups, but suspect that this benefit may have also caused you to overestimate their importance. Finally, I see similar defects and equivalent dangers in other secular groups that populate the political scene. However, I am content to let the politics of it all play out in the marketplace of ideas in our political process. I am very skeptical of anyone who advocates increased authority to government to stamp out such contrary thought or political action. In my view government is more often the problem than the solution.

You are clearly firm in your opinions, and there is little likelihood that my arguments however eloquently stated and engagingly introduced, will change your opinion - any more than yours have altered mine. This is true because we differ, not so much on the facts, as on how and in what context they should be interpreted. I accept and like you, as you are, despite this. Though you accuse me of becoming dull, I doubt that you truly believe it. (Certainly I don't).

At the same time, when you step on your podium here, I feel free to offer a contrary view to the same third parties that you are addressing,

It's been raining in San Francisco for the past four goddam days! How's Manhattan?

Lola chides others for the constancy of their responses to her own unvarying claims that there is a dangerous conspiracy of Christian religious zealots, presumably mostly evangelicals, who, in alliance with another amorphous group of "new Right" Neocons are out to very bad things - though it is sometimes hard to figure out just what.

Blatham is fixed on the evils of corporations and Republican government in the United States. (Perhaps the Canadian - or French -- versions of both are beyond reproach.) He trots out the standard litany of left-wing diatribes against the United Fruit Company and the evils done by it and the U.S. government to the hapless peasants of Guatemala (who, left to themselves, were clearly on the verge of creating a prosperous democratic paradise), as evidence of the need to suppress such evils through the adoption of more powers in the hands of government which he presumably would populate with Platonic philosopher kings.

Thomas responds, noting the mixed bag of good and evil done at the hands of both government and corporations, acknowledging the zealotry of some religious right, but noting that it is often no worse than other ubiquitous sources of that commodity. In various ways, he suggests that he rejects formulaic authoritarian answers and prefers instead the free markets of individual choice in economic and political life: even though they too create or tolerate some undesirable things, they do so generally less than the alternatives. George, silently applauds (OK, not silently).

Neither Blatham nor Lola has offered any reliable - or believable - means to the achievement of the ends implied in their criticisms.

You've lined up enough strawmen here to circle and drape the Statue of Liberty a la Cristo.

You like the Economist. Here's an NPR interview with two chaps who write for that publication on the makeup of the present Right in America. As they note in the interview, there are identifiable interest groups in the mix, often with dissimilar goals and values, and that some of those interest groups are concerned (as is Lola) that the religious element has become too powerful. <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4165172">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4165172</a>

Your notion or charge that I have some affinity for the ideas of Plato regarding how polities ought to be established are about 180 degrees the reverse of what I hold. And you haven't yet figured out that those folks who call themselves neoconservatives and who are another powerful interest group in the modern American right and this administration (listen to the interview) actually DO subscribe to those Platonic ideas - and do so openly and explicitly (which you'd find out if you'd get off your ass and read up on them).

As to thomas' intellectual objectivity and resilliency, as compared to my rigidity, I'll simply note that the commonality of your and his ideas paints your objectivity in much the same colors as that of an East German figure-skating judge.

</quote>

Here we agree. I advocate nothing (well almost nothing) to do about the problem than that solution offered on election day. I'm looking forward to 06 and I intend to do all I can to make a difference. If the extremist Christians, neocons, paleocons and such start fighting, as they have already started, the problem may be solved nicely in 06 and 08.

The other thing I advocate, but have little influence over, is a continued use of the filibuster to control the maniacs who have managed to get elected to the Congress and the White House.

Oh and of course, I support the current interpretation of the Constitution about the division between church and state. That, as you well know, is in jeopardy. Children don't need a Christian Crusader for a primary grade science teacher. I believe it's the wisest course to let parents explain any question children may have about perceived conflicts between their religious explanations for the history of the universe and the currently held scientific ones. If a science teacher or any other public official violates the principle of separation of church and state, they should be addressed and managed by their own institutions. In the case the institutions don't manage them........there should be public recourse. This goes both ways for me. No science teacher should ever comment on any religious belief. If you want to include secular humanism as a religion (I don't agree, but I see your point) I believe the same principle applies. But that's not more government. It's instead a point where government has to take one stand or the other.

As far as religious expression in schools and other public places is concerned, it seems to me that it's respectful to not impose the religious beliefs of some on others. It would be an ideal world if people of all religions could give religious expression without offending others. But do you look for it any time soon? Not me. Certainly in a country where there is a dominant religion, religion should be taught at home. Pray privately, at home, in the car, and at church. Teach your children what you want them to believe about God, etc and I'll teach my children as I believe best.

I'm sorry to hear about the rain in SF. But my experience with the weather conditions in SF have been mostly unpleasant. I almost froze to death in SF in late June. Manhattan is mixed. It was a lovely New Year's Day yesterday. Moderately cool weather and sun shinning. Today, the sun was shinning when I woke up.......but then the clouds came and it got colder and now it's dark. What have I done with this day? Mostly talking to my a2k friends. I must do something else now.

Oh, and congratulations on the new trick. I've taken notice and I love you for it.

I don't for a minute feel confused about the fact that this is an opinion piece and not hard news. So please, everyone, don't explain it to me.

This paper from the ACLU archives is not updated. It refers to the re-election of Jesse Helms, for instance. But in spite of the fact that the paper was written some years ago, it still stands as an excellent source of facts regarding school prayer and the Constitution. Further, I think the author makes a good point about why we should be talking about the phenomenon of the religious right and their attempts to establish a theocracy.....whether they can do it or not. I've highlighted the parts most relevant to our discussion to make it easier and less time consuming to read.

THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT WANTS AMERICA
By John M. Swomley

Pat Robertson and his "Christian Coalition" have declared war on a large array of organizations deemed by them to be "irreligious" or "liberal." The list of the embattled, which the ACLU heads, includes the American Jewish Congress, People for the American Way, the National Organization for Women and several churches.

Many people, noting the Coalition's agenda against homosexuality, abortion, separation of church and state, and women's rights, regard Robertson-and-company as a disruptive element on the American political scene, but one that is temporary and ultimately bound to fail. That interpretation is simplistic.

The Christian Coalition is the largest of many right wing religious groups whose members want to reorder United States political affairs under the authority of a "Christian" government. Their overarching philosophy, alternately called "Christian Reconstruction" and "Dominion Theology," was first articulated in 1973 by Rousas John Rushdoony in Institutes of Biblical Law. That philosophy is nurtured by the Coalition on Revival (COR), a secretive inner circle whose steering committee includes most of the nation's right wing Christian leaders. This hard core, which promotes the unifying ideology of the Christian right, is led by Dr. Jay Grimstead.

Strongly influenced by COR and its credo, Pat Robertson renamed his CBN (for Christian Broadcasting Network) University, Regent University, explaining that "a regent is one who governs in the absence of a sovereign." Someday, he said, "we will rule and reign along with our sovereign, Jesus Christ." Toward that day, Regent is training graduate students in education, religion, law and communications to build theological and political alliances of ready-to-rule folk. Robertson's more immediate goal, control of the Republican Party, is seen as a necessary step in pursuit of the ultimate prize: a "Christian" United States -- meaning his brand of Christianity. Robertson's writings and speeches reflect essentially theocratic models. In his 1991 book, The New World Order, he writes:

"The founders of America at Plymouth Rock and in the Massachusetts Colony felt that they were organizing a society based on the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount.... They tried their best to model their institutions of governmental order after the Bible."
Of course, the former clergyman romanticizes here. The early American leaders to whom he refers were people who burned "witches," hanged Quakers, slaughtered Native Americans, held Africans in bondage and taxed the populace to support religion.

Summarizing the colonial period, Robertson writes,

"... for almost two hundred years prior to our Constitution, all of the leadership of this nation had been steeped with biblical principles of the Old and New Testaments. Their new order was a nation founded squarely on concepts of the nature of God, the nature of man, the role of the family and the moral order as established by the God of Jacob."

What Robertson is extolling, among other things, is clerical control of politics. In colonial Massachusetts and Connecticut, reports William Warren Sweet in The Story of Religions in America, preachers' political influence was such that no one could be admitted to church membership without their consent, and voting in those colonies "was limited to church members." Sweet also describes a morals squad: "The tithing man... was a township official who assisted the constable in watching over the morals of the community. There was one such official for every ten families, who... was on the lookout for Sabbath breaking, tippling, gaming, and idleness."

Pat Robertson claims that "...the Supreme Court of the supposedly Christian United States guaranteed the moral collapse of this nation when it forbade children in the public schools to pray to the god of Jacob, to learn of His moral law or even to view in their classrooms the heart of the law, the Ten Commandments." Actually, the Supreme Court has never banned private prayer if performed silently in class or in the cafeteria over lunch. In 1962, in Engle v. Vitale, the court banned school-sponsored prayer ; and in 1963, in the Pennsylvania case Abington Township v. Schempp, it banned Bible reading as worship. The Court has permitted objectively taught courses on the Bible as literature, on the philosophy or sociology of religion, and on comparative religion. It has also allowed religious clubs to meet after instructional hours if other extra-curricular clubs are permitted to meet. Moreover, many states did not even have school-sponsored prayers or Bible readings prior to 1962.

The Christian Coalition has become a force in American politics, providing the margin for Jesse Helms' re-election. Its Christian Broadcasting Network has 1,485 radio stations and 336 television stations (numbers as of 1989), with Robertson's "700 Club" -- annual income, about $140 million -- airing daily on TV. In close touch with Robertson are other groups like James Dobson's Focus on the Family, which employs about 1,000 people, publishes eight periodicals and broadcasts on more than 1,500 radio stations.

Although the bulk of Robertson's support comes from fundamentalist Protestants and Catholics, not all fundamentalists and evangelicals support his politics or his theology. Thus, the ACLU, in coalition with both religious and secular organizations, should strive to reach as many people as possible with its message of church-state separation and other civil liberties values.

I fail to see why the Religious Right oughtn't buy into radio stations and have a wide audience tune in. I fail to see why Rupert Murdoch oughtn't start up a rabidly conservative TV network and bring it to success. And I fail to see how the alternative you propose -- the FCC decides who gets to run TV stations, and your political convictions guide the the FCC's decisions -- can be expected to yield a more attractive outcome. I believe that reflects the weakness of your arguments. If you prefer to believe it merely reflects my pig-headedness, be my guest.
</quote>

Of course, I didn't use the term 'pigheaded'. I said you were 'dogmatic'. It's a charge you and I have leveled at each other (or, certainly, have both implied) a few times previously. You hold to a principle of governance which maintains that state 'interference' will most often produce effects that hurt the overall good more than they forward overall good. With certain caveats, I think your principle deeply counter-factual and one that serves the selfish or amoral and the powerful - at the cost of much suffering to those not in such a priviledged and aristocratic category - far too often to be morally acceptable.
</quote>

I'm sorry, but I just stumbled across this gem once more, and I couldn't resist the temptation to comment on it yet again. As we write, president Bush's son is running the American government. President Kennedy's brother and president Clinton's wife are both playing pivotal roles in running the American opposition. President Kennedy's nephew-in-law is running California, the most populous state in the union. Florida is run by President "43" Bush's brother, and Chicago by the son of a famous Chicago mayor. But the most ironic thing is who runs the very agency you'd like to give more power, so it can protect your vision of diversity for American TV viewers against powerful aristocracies. The FCC's chairman just happens to be Michael K. Powell, Colin Powell's son.

So much for the free market creating powerful aristocracies, and for the government protecting us against them.

We agree on the desired ends...some equitable distribution of power and...the notion that diversity of voice is positive and monopolization of voice is the negative. But golly we sure disagree on how to get there.

We are stuck with 'government'. It will take some shape and form in any and every community.

We are also stuck with the human propensity to organize into hierarchies of dominance.

However such dominance hierarchies are established, and no matter what we call them, they function, at the top, the same way...as de facto government.

Your argue towards minimal government, apparently as a stay against that government itself seeking monopoly of power or dominance, a prospect you see as inevitable or close to it. I argue that minimal government will simply allow others do achieve the same end, inevitably.

Balance of powers - the contruction where power loci are pitted by design to act in opposition to each other - seems the best way to address the dilemma. Bush clearly doesn't agree, though he may mouth the words. He wishes the minimization of other loci of power and the centralization and dominance of power in the White House. It's one of the reasons I think he is a pathological danger (noting he ain't alone in that).

Institutions and legislation designed to achieve balance, and to achieve diversity of voice are, I think, all that keeps us from the 'raw in tooth and nail' options. So, as regards the FCC, for example, I'd opt for very stringent legislated limits on media ownership.

The wealthy will always have greater access to power. And they will tend to set the parameters of this game to their advantage. So the rest of us have to put roadblocks in their way.

Ralph Reed's Gamble
by JACK NEWFIELD

[from the July 12, 2004 issue]

When Ralph Reed was the boyish director of the Christian Coalition, he made opposition to gambling a major plank in his "family values" agenda, calling gambling "a cancer on the American body politic" that was "stealing food from the mouths of children." But now, a broad federal investigation into lobbying abuses connected to gambling on Indian reservations has unearthed evidence that Reed has been surreptitiously working for an Indian tribe with a large casino it sought to protect--and that Reed was paid with funds laundered through two firms to try to keep his lucrative involvement secret. Reed has always operated behind the scenes, and apparently he didn't want to risk becoming a humbled hypocrite like his right-wing cohorts William Bennett and Rush Limbaugh.

News accounts of the emerging scandal have focused on the two main figures under investigation: lawyer/lobbyist Jack Abramoff and Mike Scanlon, House GOP majority leader Tom DeLay's former spokesman and head of two campaign and public relations companies. But Reed has managed to slither below the media's radar--until now.

Neither he, Abramoff or Scanlon returned phone calls.

In early 2002 the Coushatta tribe of Louisiana was desperately trying to kill a planned competing casino that the rival Jena Band wanted to build in southwestern Louisiana. This new casino would have broken the Coushattas' geographical monopoly and cost the tribe--whose casino was grossing $300 million a year-- an estimated $1 billion in gambling revenue over five years. The Jena Band had hired former GOP national chairman Haley Barbour to make sure its casino compact was approved by the heavily politicized Bureau of Indian Affairs. So the Coushatta tribe, which already was in the process of paying Abramoff and Scanlon some $32 million over three years, also hired Reed, according to three witnesses and documents obtained by The Nation. This was not a crime, just furtive hypocrisy.

Two casino industry lobbyists--Philip Thompson and Bill Grimes--say they were in a meeting in Baton Rouge early in 2002 and heard William Worfel, vice chair of the Coushatta tribe, say he was hiring Reed to lobby for the tribe with the BIA to neutralize the influence Barbour had with the Bush Administration. According to Thompson, Worfel, who also did not return phone calls, "said he was putting Reed on his payroll. He said, 'If they have Barbour, we need Reed.'" A third casino lobbyist at the meeting, who requested anonymity, says Reed helped "mobilize Christian radio and ministers against the casino." But, he says, "He wanted to be able to deny it. Or if it came out, he wanted to be able to claim he was against the Jena casino, without anybody knowing he was getting paid by a bigger tribe with a bigger gambling operation."

The documents obtained by The Nation show that Reed sent bills to Abramoff and Scanlon and that one of his consulting companies, Century Strategies of Duluth, Georgia, received $250,000 from one of Scanlon's companies, Capitol Campaign Strategies. An invoice to Abramoff from another Reed company, Capitol Media, for $100,000, states only that the payment is for "Louisiana Project Mgmt. Fee." (The main thrust of the Justice Department investigation involves money laundering among Scanlon, Abramoff and Republican campaigns. Abramoff was fired by his firm for not disclosing $10 million in payments from Scanlon.)

Reed's involvement with the casino effort followed his departure from the Christian Coalition in 1997 and his reinvention of himself as a corporate lobbyist and campaign hatchet man. One of his first clients was the Enron Corporation--a deal arranged by Karl Rove when George W. Bush was starting to think about running for President in 2000. Rove wasn't ready to put Reed directly on a campaign payroll but presumably wanted to cultivate good will from Reed toward the coming Bush candidacy. Enron paid Reed's Century Strategies more than $300,000 to generate support for energy deregulation. In the 2000 GOP presidential primary, Reed justified his big Enron fee by helping to smear John McCain during the South Carolina primary. Now McCain's Indian Affairs subcommittee is investigating Indian gambling in the context of lobbying abuses, kickbacks and money laundering, with public hearings scheduled for early September.

Reed is in charge of Bush's 2004 election campaign in the Southeast, including Florida. In 2000, he was paid almost $3.7 million for helping Bush. In 1995, when he was still exploiting intolerance and fear, Time did a story on him that included the cover line "The right hand of God." Today God's right hand seems to be holding dice and a bloody political hatchet.

Masters of Sleaze
By DAVID BROOKS

Published: March 22, 2005

Down in the depths of the netherworld, where Tammany Hall grafters and Chicago ward heelers gather amid spittoons and brass railings, a reverential silence now spreads across the communion. The sleazemasters of old look back into the land of the mortals and they see greatness in the form of Jack Abramoff.

Only a genius like Abramoff could make money lobbying against an Indian tribe's casino and then turn around and make money defending that tribe against himself. Only a giant like Abramoff would have the guts to use one tribe's casino money to finance a Focus on the Family crusade against gambling in order to shut down a rival tribe's casino.

Only an artist like Abramoff could suggest to a tribe that it pay him by taking out life insurance policies on its eldest members. Then when the elders dropped off they could funnel the insurance money through a private school and into his pockets.

This is sleaze of a high order. And yet according to reports in The Washington Post and elsewhere, Abramoff accomplished it all.

Yet it's important to remember this: A genius like Abramoff doesn't spring fully formed on his own. Just as Michelangelo emerged in the ferment of Renaissance Italy, so did Abramoff emerge from his own circle of creativity and encouragement.

Back in 1995, when Republicans took over Congress, a new cadre of daring and original thinkers arose. These bold innovators had a key insight: that you no longer had to choose between being an activist and a lobbyist. You could be both. You could harness the power of K Street to promote the goals of Goldwater, Reagan and Gingrich. And best of all, you could get rich while doing it!

Before long, ringleader Grover Norquist and his buddies were signing lobbying deals with the Seychelles and the Northern Mariana Islands and talking up their interests at weekly conservative strategy sessions - what could be more vital to the future of freedom than the commercial interests of these two fine locales?

Before long, folks like Norquist and Abramoff were talking up the virtues of international sons of liberty like Angola's Jonas Savimbi and Congo's dictator Mobutu Sese Seko - all while receiving compensation from these upstanding gentlemen, according to The Legal Times. Only a reactionary could have been so discomfited by Savimbi's little cannibalism problem as to think this was not a daring contribution to the cause of Reaganism.

Soon the creative revolutionaries were blending the high-toned forms of the think tank with the low-toned scams of the buckraker. Ed Buckham, Tom DeLay's former chief of staff, helped run the U.S. Family Network, which supported the American family by accepting large donations and leasing skyboxes at the MCI Center, according to Roll Call. Michael Scanlon, DeLay's former spokesman, organized a think tank called the American International Center, located in a house in Rehoboth Beach, Del., which was occupied, according to Andrew Ferguson's devastating compendium in The Weekly Standard, by a former "lifeguard of the year" and a former yoga instructor.

Ralph Reed, meanwhile, smashed the tired old categories that used to separate social conservatives from corporate consultants. Reed signed on with Channel One, Verizon, Enron and Microsoft to shore up the moral foundations of our great nation. Reed so strongly opposes gambling as a matter of principle that he bravely accepted $4 million through Abramoff from casino-rich Indian tribes to gin up a grass-roots campaign.

As time went by, the spectacular devolution of morals accelerated. Many of the young innovators were behaving like people who, having read Barry Goldwater's "Conscience of a Conservative," embraced the conservative part while discarding the conscience part.

Abramoff's and Scanlon's Indian-gaming scandal will go down as the movement's crowning achievement, more shameless than anything the others would do, but still the culmination of the trends building since 1995. It perfectly embodied their creed and philosophy: "I'd love us to get our mitts on that moolah!!" as Abramoff wrote to Reed.

They made at least $66 million.

This is a major accomplishment. And remember: Abramoff didn't do it on his own.

It took a village. The sleazo-cons thought they could take over K Street to advance their agenda. As it transpired, K Street took over them.

Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana
Lovelin Poncho, Chairman
William Worfel, Vice-Chairman
P. O. Box 99
Elton, LA 70532

Re: Ethics Board Docket No. 2002-202

Dear Mr. Poncho and Mr. Worfel:

The Louisiana Board of Ethics, acting as the Supervisory Committee on Campaign Finance Disclosure, after a confidential investigation believes the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana violated Section 1505.1B of the Campaign Finance Disclosure Act (the "Act"). LSA-R.S. 18:1505.1B.

The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana (the "Tribe") used the slogan "Concerned Citizens Against Gaming Expansion" in its to opposition to a proposition election on April 6, 2002 to allow a riverboat casino to operate in Calcasieu Parish. (The tribe's competition)

The Tribe spent $156,642.72 for advertisements, mailers, and telephone solicitations to oppose the proposition, all of which said paid for by "Concerned Citizens Against Gaming Expansion." The newspaper, radio and television advertisements ran between March 29, 2002 and April 6, 2002. The telephone solicitations occurred on April 1, 2002.

The Tribe did not timely file reports in connection with the April 6, 2002 proposition election.

Section 1486 of the Act requires any person who spends more than $200 in support or opposition to a proposition election to file campaign finance reports. In accordance with that section, the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana was required to file a Special Report by April 3, 2002, and a 40th day after the election by May 16, 2002. The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana did not file the required reports until October 23, 2002.

Section 1505.4A(2)(a)(iv) of the Act provides that a per day penalty of $40 per day, up to a maximum of $1,000, be assessed against a person who supports or opposes a proposition and fails to timely file campaign finance disclosure reports. Section 1505.4A(4) of the Act BD 2002-202
Page of

provides that a person may be assessed an additional civil penalty of up to $10,000 for the failure to timely file the reports.

Considering the above facts, the Board concludes that the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana violated the provisions of Section 1505.1B of the Act and that late fees of $240 and $1,000 should be assessed for the Tribe's failure to timely file the Special and the 40th day after the election campaign finance disclosure reports, respectively, as well as an additional civil penalty of $5,000 per each report for violating Section 1505.1B of the Act.

By Order of the Board this 12th day of December, 2002.

This Thursday the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a vote on U.S. Circuit Court nominee Thomas Griffith. Mr. Griffith is a highly qualified attorney who Senate Democrats plan to block by using their unprecedented judicial filibustering tactic. Liberal groups such as the ACLU and People for the American Way are gleefully pulling the strings of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV), among others, in their ongoing efforts to block potential judges who would follow the law instead of creating it. This puppet-show coalition looks to men in black robes to pass their liberal agendas while end- running elected officials and the legislative process.

Last Friday, Supreme Court Justice (and former ACLU lawyer) Ruth Bader Ginsburg spoke on how important it is for American courts to look to foreign precedent and opinion. Her comments highlight why judges who look to U.S. laws, and not foreign jurisprudence, are sorely needed. Noticing the recent trend to look to other countries for rationalizing judicial activism within our court system, Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) has introduced Senate Resolution 92. The resolution states that courts should not look to "foreign judgments, laws, or pronouncements" when interpreting the United States Constitution. The United States was founded by patriots looking to escape foreign rule.

Timber -- I think Lola is arguing that the Supreme Court ought to seek more guidance from the stricter international laws on abortion and euthanasia, and that the FRC is attacking America's culture of life by endorsing the United States' own, more liberal jurisprudence. But Lola doesn't actually say what her argument is, presumably believing that the excerpt speaks for itself; so I could be wrong.

On a more serious note, I had to think of this thread just a few days ago when I was visiting the website of the Missouri synod of the Lutheran Church, which some friends of mine are seriously engaged in. In their FAQ, <a href="http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=4409">one of the questions is</a>, "does the Lutheran Church consider itself part of the Protestant Church?" And the first protestant church there ever was answers, "depends on what you mean by 'Protestant'". Something appears to be very wrong with America's protestants when the Lutheran Church distances itself from them in that way -- which, I have to admit, supports Lola's position and contradicts mine.

That was last night and I have forgotten. But the aspect that stands out to me tonight has to do with irony. Here is the Republican party....against government regulation, yada yada.........and what is the first move they make when they think something should be regulated? Yes, it's government regulation. (They think almost everything should be regulated, btw.) And the regulation is proposed at the highest level.........these New Right guys want to change constitutions. But they don't believe in government regulation. Isn't that right, george?

I appreciate you saying so, Thomas. But in a way it supports both of our positions. Your idea was that the American people wouldn't let religious fanatics take over. And I think the action of the Lutheran Church to distance itself from the fanatics is in fact, hopefully, intended to curb the evangelical's power in government. So I said it was dangerous and needed attention and you said the people wouldn't let it happen. And we are both correct..........so far.

I think most conservatives and Republicans strongly oppose any reference to the laws of foreign countries in making judicial findings, on any matter - particularly in appellate actions. Our Constitution empowers judges to act in accordance with our laws and our constitution - and no other law or source of authority. The recent references in Supreme Court decisions to the prevailing international norms in their prohibition of the death penalty, in the case of convicted criminals whose crimes were committed when they were minors, is - in my view - an obvious case of illegal overreach on the part of the Supreme Court. It is legislating from the bench, and overturning state laws on matters clearly within the purview of the states, based on factors not found in our constitution - except by a rather tortured interpretation. The appropriate remedy for this - in my view - is the impeachment of the justices involved, prominently including Justices Kennedy and Ginsberg..

Does this include the "authority" of the Bible? The judges are doing thier jobs as defined by the Constitution and calling them any name will not change that fact. This is an obvious run at the judiciary. And it will not be tolerated.

Re: The Religious Right and Contemporary American Politics
I haven't read this thread, so I'm kinda just barging in. But Lola did write:

<quote orig_author="Lola">
Let's post and discuss any instance that comes to our attention involving the religious right.
</quote>

So here I go.

Today, Constitutional Girl posted a thread called <a href="http://www.able2know.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=49405&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=">No help from World Organization's</a>. It turned out to be about debt relief for the poorest countries. She got a newsletter from something called The Jubilee Action Alert about how the poorest countries of the world, who now spend a fair chunk of their national budget just paying off interest on long-standing loans to rich Western countries, should get their debt cancelled, and how IMF, World Bank and G-8 had been resisting before but now there's a good chance of a breakthrough. Action was needed.

To her, it reinforced "why we Conservatives go against World Organizations". OK, so there's some confusions here. The World Bank and definitely the IMF are hardly the Left's darlings after all - rather their bugbears. Let's assume that ConstitutionalGirl is quite young. But the point I picked up on was that apparently, her conservative/church community was pushing the debt relief issue with fervour. Pushing for a so-called Jubilee Act, in fact, on granting far-reaching debt relief.

Some googling bore this out. The debt relief movement has more than its fair share of anti-globalisation, anti-poverty, leftist players. But its also driven very strongly by church groups. OK, so the Jubilee USA network itself leans mostly on the religious left, so to say - check <a href="http://www.jubileeusa.org/jubilee.cgi?path=/about_the_network/member_organizations&amp;page=who_are_we.html">the list of member organisations here (bottom)</a>. But the church campaign for debt relief also reaches far into the religious right. A previous (abortive) drive for a "Jubilee Act" on debt relief, in 1999, was spearheaded by two Republican Congressmen for example.

Fascinating is the account in The Journal of Pastoral Care of a retired pastor who prayed and fasted for some 45 days in the halls of Congress to lobby for that "Debt Relief for Poverty Reduction Act". He recounts how he was warmly received by Joe Biden. But he also references how he had wanted Reverend Billy Graham to meet Jesse Helms in order to convince him - because Billy Graham, too, had issued a statement strongly endorsing the drive for debt relief. And the man only gave up his fast after Spencer Bachus, a Republican Congressman from Alabama, had pledged to continue his fast in Congress himself.

Now make no mistake: the actual votes on the issue clearly showed that the bulk of support for debt relief still came from the House Democrats. But on one crucial vote, some 26 Republicans crossed over to their side and Church activism seems to have had a lot to do with that. After all, Iowan James Leach who had sponsored the bill is a moderate. But Spencer Bachus <a href="http://www.issues2000.org/House/Spencer_Bachus.htm">was rated</a> 0% by NARAL, 7% by ACLU and 92% by the Christian Coalition. And Frank Wolf from Virginia, who was also among the first eight co-sponsors, was rated 0% by NARAL, 0% by the ACLU and 84% by the Christian Coalition.

I thought that was interesting to note in this thread too. See for more info <a href="http://www.able2know.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1277525#1277525">my post in CG's thread</a>. A good (I actually misspelled that "god" just now) example of how liberals and Christians can find each other.

A Grand Time and a Grand Bargain
Published on April 12, 2005

A GRAND TIME TO BE RICH AND POWERFUL IN AMERICA

According to this in the L.A. Times, worker pay for the last 14 months has trailed inflation. In real dollars, workers have taken a tiny pay cut.

But not to worry: In the same time frame, corporate profits hit record highs... and the tax rate on dividends paid out of those profits has been slashed by 62% since President Bush took office. (I know some of you think relatively little cash is involved, but <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35671-2005Apr7.html">$441</a> billion was paid out in personal dividends in 2004, most of it to those already best off.)

The most outspokenly religious president in our history, Bush's unique interpretation of Christ's philosophy is to cut programs for the poor while slashing taxes for the rich.

Which brings to mind a quote one of you kindly sent in:

"A tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion. Subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider god-fearing and pious. On the other hand, they do less easily move against him, believing that he has the gods on his side." - Aristotle

Which brings to mind another quote one of you kindly sent me:

"Why is this man in the White House? The majority of Americans did not vote for him. Why is he there? And I tell you this morning that he's in the White House because God put him there for a time such as this." - Lt. Gen. William Boykin; New York Times, 17 October 2003

Not to say I believe President Bush is a tyrant (or sent by God). But he and the Republican leadership have unquestionably tilted the playing field even more heavily in favor of the best off.

A GRAND BARGAIN

And if you think religion and economic policy are unrelated in America, consider <a href="http://www.au.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;amp;id=7256&amp;amp;abbr=cs_&amp;amp;s_oo=Efey_7QjVWqPLhYs3lnipg..">this</a> (thanks, Gary). It holds that the religious right has agreed to support the President's Social Security "reform" in exchange for his pushing harder for the Federal Anti-Gay-Marriage Amendment.

In part (from Americans United for Separation of Church and State)( <a href="http://www.au.org/site/PageServer">link</a> ):

... the Religious Right leaders of the Arlington Group are playing hardball politics and have cast aside concerns about the economic well-being of citizens reliant on Social Security in order to score a big political victory - passage of a constitutional amendment to prevent legal recognition of gay marriage.

If it seems callous to jeopardize the social safety net (and borrow trillions of dollars from the next generation) simply to be certain Charles and I can't have the same rights other couples do - hang on. At least some men of the cloth have come up with the rationale:

Douglas Barker, a Baptist pastor in Alexandria, Va., writing the series for BP News, argued that Social Security had weakened or undermined churches' roles in helping the poor and elderly. Barker insisted that it is "disturbing" that so many Christian leaders, citing scripture, supported the formation of Social Security when it began in the '30s.

"Yes, government has a role in protecting its citizens, but it should never come at the expense of the church abdicating its biblically mandated role," Barker wrote Feb. 9.

OK, there was the thing about 26 Republicans crossing over for the vote, true. But I didnt see that described anywhere as an anti-leadership move or anti-Bush vote - hell, Bush wasnt even President yet. In fact, Bush's own current line on debt relief seems to be being influenced quite positively by these groups.

I just see some folks standing up for what they believe in - and it turns out that their "religious right" values happen, on this subject, to align with those of the liberals. It would probably be easier to form such strategic alliances on individual topics more often if every time "they" happen to agree with us wasnt primarily used/paraded as the sign of impending doom for George Bush. Thats not generally how you get an Alabaman Republican on board for this or that cause.

Meanwhile, the most aggressive opponents of abortion began pushing a no-holds-barred approach to clear every possible obstacle from their path, including changing 200-year-old Senate rules that allow senators to block approval of nominees by filibustering. Some even suggested blocking Specter's chairmanship by rewriting regulations so the current anti-abortion committee head wouldn't have to step down.

That's not quite true. Until recently the Senate had by long-establish prectice, never fillibustered to prevent a vote on a judicial nominee, though the rules, strictly speaking, did not forbid it. The prevailing view was that the Senate had a constitutional DUTY to vote on Presidential appointments in accordance with the Advise and Consent provision of the constitution. This duty was not subject to the maneuverings that often accompany other Senatorial enactments.

Now Senate Democrats have broken this long-established practice, based on the principle of Constitutional duty, and the Republicans are faced with figuring out what to do about it. One way is to ament the cloture rules to prevent a fillibuster by majority vote. This is something the Senate can readily do - no constitutional issue is involved. Republicans would merely be countering one change in Senatorial practice with another.

When you said..."The prevailing view was that the Senate had a constitutional DUTY to vote on Presidential appointments in accordance with the Advise and Consent provision of the constitution."

That isnt quite true either.
NOWHERE in the Constitution does it say the Senate has to vote on Presidential appointments.
It does say that they must "advise and consent".

That means that a letter signed by 51 Senators would qualify as "advise and consent" to a Presidential appt.
There is no constitutionally defined way that the advise and consent,only that they must do that.

Wat I said was the prevailing view (in the Senate) was that they had a duty to act on nominations by some means that involved the Senate as a whole in their advise and consent role.

The new twist introduced by the Democrat - something never done until recently- is to filibuster to prevent a vote on the Senate floor at all. A two-thirds majority is required to invoke cloture and stop a filibuster, and, lacking a two-thirds majority, the Republicans cannot bring their judicial nominations to the Senate floor at all. Again the past practice in the Senate was based on the prevailing belief that their duty to advise and consent required a floor vote of the entire Senate and the ensuing majority rule. Now, with Democrats filibustering and prohibiting a floor vote, they have, in effect, imposed a two-thirds requirement on Senate consent - something not foreseen in the Constitution.

The new twist introduced by the Democrat - something never done until recently- is to filibuster to prevent a vote on the Senate floor at all.
</quote>

Not true. Filibusters have been used in the past -- by both parties -- to block judicial nominees. Republicans, aided by conservative southern Democrats, filibustered the nomination of Abe Fortas for the position of chief justice of the supreme court in 1968, a fact pointed out recently by the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45149-2005Mar17.html">Washington Post</a> (registration required): Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) told his panel this month that the judicial battles have escalated, "with the filibuster being employed for the first time in the history of the Republic." Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said in a Senate speech last week, "The crisis created by the unprecedented use of filibusters to defeat judicial nominations must be solved." Such claims, however, are at odds with the record of the successful 1968 GOP-led filibuster against President Lyndon B. Johnson's nomination of Abe Fortas to be chief justice of the United States. "Fortas Debate Opens with a Filibuster," a Page One Washington Post story declared on Sept. 26, 1968. It said, "A full-dress Republican-led filibuster broke out in the Senate yesterday against a motion to call up the nomination of Justice Abe Fortas for Chief Justice." In a weird riposte to Democrats, the <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110003629">Wall Street Journal</a> said that the current use of the filibuster was unprecedented, and then admitted that the GOP-led effort to block the Fortas nomination was a filibuster. Presumably, although the Fortas nomination was filibustered, it was (in the eyes of the WSJ) a good filibuster, and thus readily distinguishable from the bad filibusters practiced by today's Democrats.

Wrong again. The senate rules require a three-fifths majority to invoke cloture.

The Republicans have certainly become recent converts to the church of the holy filibuster-buster. According to the Congressional Research Service, cloture motions were filed and cloture votes held on 14 appeals court nominations from 1980 to 2000. As recently as 2000, cloture votes were necessary to obtain votes on the nominations of both Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit. Current Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist was among those voting against cloture on the Paez nomination. Democrats have also demanded 60 votes for controversial nominees, such as Edward Carnes, who was nominated to the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in 1992. <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=11630">Source</a>. Furthermore, the Republicans who are currently bemoaning the undemocratic nature of having a two-fifths minority blocking judicial nominations were strangely reticent about the senate's "blue slip" procedures during the Clinton era, whereby a single senator could block a judicial nomination (and <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200502180004">GOP senators did it sixty times</a> ).

I think the distinction you are trying to make is getting very tenuous. Among the Religious Right, there are those who care for the poor and want to feed them, and those who believe they should pull themselves up by the bootstraps and preach tough love. Check. We know which ones we agree with - which ones the Left could work together with if the issue comes up. OK. So we have established that the Religious Right is diverse and parts of it can be worked with. Same with fundamentalists. So now you are arguing that the evil group we should fear and oppose relentlessly can be distinguished from those who actually care about the poor because they are "the fanatics who are organized". Those are the "fanatical control freak fundamentalists", and its the fact that they're so organised that makes them dangerous. But it looks to me from the info I posted about the Jubilee Act efforts, for example, that the feed-the-poor fundamentalists are pretty darn well organized as well. Plus, more relevantly, they're often the same persons. They were supported by Billy Graham, for one. By hardline Religious Right Congressmen from Alabama and Virginia.

I would propose that trying to distinguish the "good ones" from the "bad ones" as supposedly two distinct groups - one of which should then still be opposed, isolated and been wary of at all times, is untenable. Looks like the fact of the matter is this: the Religious Right believes the opposite of what we believe when it comes to abortion, gay rights and plenty of other causes like that. Those "nice" feed-the-poor fundamentalists do so no less than the up-by-your-bootstraps ones. But on other issues - poverty, development aid - many of those same people can apparently be talked with. Its a mixed bag, but not because there's some evil masterminds among them that the gullible good ones need to be warned about - but simply because all of them will disagree with you on most things, but agree with you on some things.

I doubt that's the distinction that C. Boyden Gray was talking about in his WSJ piece. The rules regarding filibusters have changed since 1968; both sides essentially recognized that there was no need for one side to stage a filibuster if the other side didn't have enough votes for a cloture motion. If, on the other hand, a single senator wanted to stage a filibuster (in the manner of Jimmy Stewart in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"), then I suppose he'd still have to hold the floor and talk until he dropped.

Of course Billy Graham is with the feed the poor crowd, he has no representatives on the Council for National Policy either. And of course there's over lap. Relief missions have been the work of Christians for many years. Direct mail fund raising has made millions on raising funds for those missions (not a bad thing in my mind). And many of these missions are run by fundamentalists. However, I find, among those I know personally who are involved in the CNP (Council on National Policy) -- and I know many of them -- the politically motivated fundamentalists are not the same fundamentalists/religious activists that spend most of their time being concerned about the poor and running organizations for hunger relief (I know lots of these folks too. Many of them are my friends.) But that is still not my point. Sorry I'm not being clear, but I have a lot of work to do besides a2k.

I think it would be excellent if we could find a way to appeal to those Christians out there who have traditional Christian values, like feeding the poor, rehabilitating the criminal, drug addicted, and the mentally incompetent, etc. And I think it's something that is being done.

But my point is this. If you think we'll be able to stop those fundamentalists who have been organized for thirty years in order to control our government by appealing to the need to feed the poor, you are indeed poorly informed and naive. My idea is to point to those forces that are active at this time that are threatening our democracy. If the good hearted Christians begin to see, as I believe they are beginning to do, that they are being manipulated and they are offered something they can be for, there is a good chance we'll make some good progress.

I am in absolute agreement with you that an important tactic now is to appeal to Christians who are not fanatics with a call for true Christian values. Because many of these are the very ones being manipulated by the fanatics (I use "fanatics" as short hand because I'm in a hurry.) Up to now the politically motivated fundamentalists have been doing an excellent job using good hearted Christians to further their cause. And I am delighted that, as Cyclo said on another thread, the pretty paint is beginning to peel off. You have acknowledged it yourself.

You shouldn't take my dedication for exposing this organized effort as an unwillingness to work in a positive vein. The battle has to be fought on both fronts. This is a culture war and we're in danger of losing it. This loss will set us back at least 50 years. All the progress we've made in the last half century (the expanse of lifetime so far of many of us) will be severely damaged.

As far as I know you and I are on the same side.

"I blame Congress over the last 50 to 100 years for not standing up and taking its responsibility given to it by the Constitution. The reason the judiciary has been able to impose a separation of church and state that's nowhere in the Constitution is that Congress didn't stop them.

Well, it is obvious. There is only one thing to do with such a dangerous man that Cyclo has told us about. We must see to it that the allegations about DeLay are proven, then he must be impeached.

It is unfortunate that the Democrats no longer control the House( They did for some many years) but, as all of us know, the House turned Republican in 1994`and has not changed since.

It is too bad that Clinton couldn't keep his hand off his zipper. We might have still had a Democratic House.

Can you imagine? DeLay would be subject to the same ignominy that Clinton had to bear--Grand Jury hearings, impeachment hearings, Loss of his lawyer's license. fines by the courts.

It would be fun to watch.

I know I had a great time watching Clinton twisting in the wind.

Lola,

You should do a better job filtering out the nonsense from the stream of pre-digested "explanations" coming out of the Democrat Party of NO (no votes, no hearings, no program, no ideas, no leaders).

Quoting Stalin (or more accurately paraphrasing his words)doesn't make one a believer in the tyranny and oppression he created. Asking for a Senate vote on Presidential nominees, or a hearing by the House Ethics Committee on charges brought by Democrats against DeLay, doesn't constitute a conspiracy to overthrow the constitution.

I note you have begun to emphasize that there are some "good" Christians who have "good" views on all matters - as opposed to the "fanatical religious right". Apart from a desire to "help the poor", what are the distinguishing characteristics of the "good" ones? Why this new emphasis? Have you begun to feel that you are - or appear - a bit intolerant?

Are there "good" and "bad" secularists &amp; anti religious people? Do the ratios of the "good" and "bad" ones vary between these groups? Are there any "bad" secularists out there who would undermine values you consider important?

Ralph Reed's Zeal for Lobbying Is Shaking His Political Faithful
By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK
and PHILIP SHENON

Published: April 18, 2005

ATLANTA - In 30 years of culture wars, few conservative Christian standard bearers have traveled further in American politics than Ralph Reed. The former head of the Christian Coalition has been a high-priced communications consultant, a top Bush campaign adviser, chairman of Georgia's Republican Party and now a candidate for lieutenant governor here.

Campaigning in early April at a Republican district meeting outside Atlanta, Mr. Reed talked of his small-town roots in northeast Georgia.

"I'm not going to forget where I came from," he said. "I am not going to forget what I stand for."

But as he completes his journey from Christian advocate to professional politician, Mr. Reed, 43, finds himself carrying some baggage: his ties to an old friend, the Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff.

In Washington, federal investigations of Mr. Abramoff, a close ally of Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, have revealed that Mr. Abramoff paid Mr. Reed's consulting firm more than $4 million to help organize Christian opposition to Indian casinos in Texas and Louisiana - money that came from other Indians with rival casinos.

Mr. Reed declined to comment for this article; he has said publicly that he did not know that casino owners were paying for his services and that he has never deviated from his moral opposition to gambling. But the episode is a new blemish on the boyish face that once personified the rise of evangelical Christians to political power in America.

Some of Mr. Reed's past patrons - including the Rev. Pat Robertson, the Christian broadcaster who set Mr. Reed on the national stage by hiring him to run the Christian Coalition - say his work with Mr. Abramoff's Indian casino clients raises questions about how he has balanced his personal ambitions with his Christian principles.

"You know that song about the Rhinestone Cowboy, 'There's been a load of compromising on the road to my horizon,' " Mr. Robertson said. "The Bible says you can't serve God and Mammon."

In Georgia, Mr. Reed's rival in the Republican primary is playing up his links with Indian casinos to try to revive longstanding criticism from conservative Christian purists that Mr. Reed has sometimes put his own ambitions ahead of their goals. At the meeting near Atlanta, for example, his opponents were doing their best to sow doubts in the crowd.

"The Christian Coalition, they may have some shady background," said Robert McIntyre, the treasurer of the Spalding County Republican Party, who still wore a Ralph Reed sticker on his lapel. "I was being loyal to Ralph Reed, but since now some things have come up, I need to listen. I am now wavering."

Others argue, however, that shaking soiled hands is sometimes the price of making an impact.

"Thirty or 40 years ago, the people who you would see as the spokesmen for traditional values kind of things were people who were outsiders railing against the system," said Kelly Shackelford, a prominent Christian conservative and president of the Free Market Foundation in Texas. "And if they didn't get a hundred percent of what they believe in, they weren't going to play." Mr. Reed led a new wave of Christian conservatives, Mr. Shackelford said, who "understand that you have to be part of the system, and you can't sit outside and throw rocks at everybody."

Bill Paxon, a former Congressman turned lobbyist who worked closely with Mr. Reed on Republican Congressional campaigns, said Mr. Reed was a man of many dimensions: a heartfelt Christian, a limited-government conservative and a canny political street fighter. "He was always all of the above," Mr. Paxon said.

Unlike most conservative Christian leaders, Mr. Reed was drawn to Republican politics first and evangelical faith later. He arrived in Washington as a 19-year-old Senate intern in 1981 and became executive director of the College Republican National Committee two years later, under Mr. Abramoff as chairman.

Mr. Abramoff was "a conservative firebrand," Mr. Reed wrote in his book "Active Faith." The men became so close that Mr. Reed sometimes slept on Mr. Abramoff's couch and later introduced Mr. Abramoff to his future wife.

Ralph Reed's Zeal for Lobbying Is Shaking His Political Faithful

(Page 2 of 3)

The same year he joined the College Republicans, Mr. Reed started attending an evangelical church and became born again. "I was a bare-knuckled political operative," Mr. Reed wrote in his book. "In the rough and tumble of politics, I began to sense the need for spiritual roots."

In 1988, Mr. Robertson hired Mr. Reed to build the Christian Coalition from his campaign organization. Mr. Reed became a hero to evangelical Christians who saw him as a fresh-faced, telegenic spokesman who could defend their views to the secular world of Sunday-morning talk shows and weekly magazines.

But he also boasted at times of working "under the cover of night" to mobilize grass-roots support. He honed his skills at organizing phone banks and direct-mail campaigns, and former associates say he talked in the cynical lingo of political operatives, referring to a candidate as "the body" and about fund-raising "dough."

"There is a duality to Ralph, the godly rhetoric and the hardball political operative, and what he says with his godly hat on is very different than with his political hat on," said Marshall Wittmann, who worked as legislative director of the Christian Coalition but is now a senior fellow at the centrist-liberal Democratic Leadership Council. "There are very few guardrails for Ralph when it comes to politics."

During his years at the Christian Coalition, his opponents and some evangelical Christians, including Dr. James C. Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family, sometimes argued that Mr. Reed put Republican political or economic goals ahead of social conservative policies. The Internal Revenue Service declined to renew the Christian Coalition's tax-exempt status as a nonpartisan group in 1999, concluding after a 10-year review that it had worked too closely with the Republican Party.

Soon after he left the organization in 1997, it nearly imploded as financial problems came to light.

At the time, Mr. Reed said he was starting a political consulting and communications firm "because I know there are hundreds of candidates out there who share the kind of values that I do." But his firm, Century Strategies, also took on deep-pocket corporate clients, including Verizon, Enron and Microsoft.

Some Christian conservatives were surprised. "Most of us in the movement are where we are because we believe in what we are doing," said the Rev. Don Wildmon, founder of the American Family Association. "I don't know any of us trying to get rich."

Some of Mr. Reed's efforts for clients soon drew criticism. While he was working as an adviser to George W. Bush's campaign in 2000, he also was working for Microsoft on a campaign to influence Mr. Bush and other presidential candidates about the company's antitrust battles. Mr. Reed later apologized for creating the appearance of a conflict.

In Georgia, some conservative Christians were troubled by Mr. Reed's consulting work for Mitch Skandalakis, a losing candidate for lieutenant governor who ran advertisements portraying one rival in racial stereotypes and another as a drug addict. (Mr. Reed said afterward that he opposed racially divisive tactics.)

"There are questions as to whether Mitch Skandalakis lined up well with the viewpoints of social and economic conservatives," said Randy Hicks, president of the Georgia Family Council. "And Ralph taking him on was not well received by an awful lot of people."

By 1999, Mr. Abramoff, who was well known as a lobbyist for Indian casinos, had hired Mr. Reed's firm to help organize antigambling campaigns in Texas and Louisiana.

Lisa Baron, a spokeswoman for Mr. Reed's firm, said that Mr. Abramoff had told Mr. Reed that the payment for his consulting services came from a "broad-based coalition" of antigambling groups. "We did not know who his specific clients were or their specific interests," Ms. Baron said.

In fact, Mr. Abramoff had recruited Mr. Reed to help the Coushatta Indians of Louisiana shut down or block casinos operated or proposed by the Tiguas, in neighboring Texas, or the Jena Band of Choctaws, in Louisiana, according to disclosures by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, which is investigating $82 million in lobbying fees that Mr. Abramoff and his partner, Michael Scanlon, reaped from tribes.

Ralph Reed's Zeal for Lobbying Is Shaking His Political Faithful

(Page 3 of 3)

E-mail messages disclosed by the committee last year offered some unflattering views of Mr. Reed and Mr. Abramoff. In one, Mr. Reed forwarded potentially damaging information about Indian contributions to a politician supporting the casinos, saying, "We are getting this in the water with the right people."

In another, he called supportive legislators his "tigers." And he boasted of how he had gotten "our pastors all riled up" to push John Cornyn, who was then Texas attorney general and is now a senator, to close the Tigua casino. Mr. Cornyn, however, already had opposed gambling, according to a spokesman.

After a court ruled against the Tiguas' casino on Feb. 11, 2002, Mr. Abramoff wrote to Mr. Reed in an e-mail message: "I wish those moronic Tiguas were smarter in their political contributions. I'd love us to get our mitts on that moolah."

Ms. Baron, Mr. Reed's spokeswoman, said that after the cost of direct mail, phone banks and radio advertising, his firm kept only 15 percent to 20 percent of the roughly $4 million it received from Mr. Abramoff between 1999 and 2002.

"Ralph is in the casino-closing business," she said, "and we ran a successful grass-roots campaign to close casinos and prevent casinos from operating."

Seven days after the "moolah" message, however, Mr. Abramoff sent the Tigua tribe an elaborate proposal that it pay him to help reopen the casino. Ms. Baron said that Mr. Reed had "no knowledge" of Mr. Abramoff's plan to seek business on both sides of that casino fight.

In the Christian conservative world that forms Mr. Reed's most natural political base, many say they accept his explanation. "He was betrayed by a friend who lied to him," said Dr. Richard Land, president of the ethics and religious liberties commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.

Tom Minnery, a vice president of Focus on the Family, said he did not know the facts. He said the group had often criticized Republican politicians, including Mr. DeLay, for taking money from gambling interests. Of Mr. Reed, Mr. Minnery said, "We wish he wouldn't have done that."

Mr. Reed's primary opponent, State Senator Casey Cagle, criticized him last week for inviting at least three lobbyists whose firms have worked for gambling concerns to a Washington fund-raiser tomorrow.

"Ralph has a lot of things he has got to answer for, like this gambling situation," said Joel McElhannon, a consultant to Mr. Cagle's campaign. "It strains believability that somebody hands him $4.2 million and he doesn't know where that money came from."

Among the Republican Party stalwarts at the meeting near Atlanta, though, many were eager to snap pictures of themselves and their families with Mr. Reed. In his speech, he omitted references to God, prayer, abortion, obscenity or the Christian Coalition, instead echoing President Bush's inaugural themes about spreading democracy abroad.

"We are so proud of him when he gets on television because he speaks for people like me, true conservative Republicans, and it is such a breath of fresh air to see someone who can go toe to toe with the people who don't," said Jean Studdard, a local Republican official.

"We really haven't heard anything about the Indian gambling thing yet," she added. "Of course, we want to hear Ralph's side of the story."

The atheist
Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins explains why God is a delusion, religion is a virus, and America has slipped back into the Dark Ages.

- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Gordy Slack

April 28, 2005 | Richard Dawkins is the world's most famous out-of-the-closet living atheist. He is also the world's most controversial evolutionary biologist. Publication of his 1976 book, "The Selfish Gene," thrust Dawkins into the limelight as the handsome, irascible, human face of scientific reductionism. The book provoked everything from outrage to glee by arguing that natural selection worked its creative powers only through genes, not species or individuals. Humans are merely "gene survival machines," he asserted in the book.

Dawkins stuck to his theme but expanded his territory in such subsequent books as "The Blind Watchmaker," "Unweaving the Rainbow" and "Climbing Mount Improbable." His recent work, "The Ancestor's Tale," traces human lineage back through time, stopping to ponder important forks in the evolutionary road.

Given his outspoken defense of Darwin, and natural selection as the force of life, Dawkins has assumed a new role: the religious right's Public Enemy No. 1. Yet Dawkins doesn't shy from controversy, nor does he suffer fools gladly. He recently met a minister who was on the opposite side of a British political debate. When the minister put out his hand, Dawkins kept his hands at his side and said, "You, sir, are an ignorant bigot."

Currently, Dawkins is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University, a position created for him in 1995 by Charles Simonyi, a Microsoft millionaire. Earlier this year, Dawkins signed an agreement with British television to make a documentary about the destructive role of religion in modern history, tentatively titled "The Root of All Evil."

I met Dawkins in late March at the Atheist Alliance International annual conference in Los Angeles, where he presented the alliance's top honor, the Richard Dawkins Prize, to magicians Penn and Teller. During our conversation in my hotel room, Dawkins was as gracious as he was punctiliously dressed in a crisp white shirt and soft blazer.

Once again, evolution is under attack. Are there any questions at all about its validity?

It's often said that because evolution happened in the past, and we didn't see it happen, there is no direct evidence for it. That, of course, is nonsense. It's rather like a detective coming on the scene of a crime, obviously after the crime has been committed, and working out what must have happened by looking at the clues that remain. In the story of evolution, the clues are a billionfold.

There are clues from the distribution of DNA codes throughout the animal and plant kingdoms, of protein sequences, of morphological characters that have been analyzed in great detail. Everything fits with the idea that we have here a simple branching tree. The distribution of species on islands and continents throughout the world is exactly what you'd expect if evolution was a fact. The distribution of fossils in space and in time are exactly what you would expect if evolution were a fact. There are millions of facts all pointing in the same direction and no facts pointing in the wrong direction.

British scientist J.B.S. Haldane, when asked what would constitute evidence against evolution, famously said, "Fossil rabbits in the Precambrian." They've never been found. Nothing like that has ever been found. Evolution could be disproved by such facts. But all the fossils that have been found are in the right place. Of course there are plenty of gaps in the fossil record. There's nothing wrong with that. Why shouldn't there be? We're lucky to have fossils at all. But no fossils have been found in the wrong place, such as to disprove the fact of evolution. Evolution is a fact.

Still, so many people resist believing in evolution. Where does the resistance come from?

It comes, I'm sorry to say, from religion. And from bad religion. You won't find any opposition to the idea of evolution among sophisticated, educated theologians. It comes from an exceedingly retarded, primitive version of religion, which unfortunately is at present undergoing an epidemic in the United States. Not in Europe, not in Britain, but in the United States.

My American friends tell me that you are slipping towards a theocratic Dark Age. Which is very disagreeable for the very large number of educated, intelligent and right-thinking people in America. Unfortunately, at present, it's slightly outnumbered by the ignorant, uneducated people who voted Bush in.

But the broad direction of history is toward enlightenment, and so I think that what America is going through at the moment will prove to be a temporary reverse. I think there is great hope for the future. My advice would be, Don't despair, these things pass.

You delve into agnosticism in "The Ancestor's Tale." How does it differ from atheism?

It's said that the only rational stance is agnosticism because you can neither prove nor disprove the existence of the supernatural creator. I find that a weak position. It is true that you can't disprove anything but you can put a probability value on it. There's an infinite number of things that you can't disprove: unicorns, werewolves, and teapots in orbit around Mars. But we don't pay any heed to them unless there is some positive reason to think that they do exist.

Believing in God is like believing in a teapot orbiting Mars?

Yes. For a long time it seemed clear to just about everybody that the beauty and elegance of the world seemed to be prima facie evidence for a divine creator. But the philosopher David Hume already realized three centuries ago that this was a bad argument. It leads to an infinite regression. You can't statistically explain improbable things like living creatures by saying that they must have been designed because you're still left to explain the designer, who must be, if anything, an even more statistically improbable and elegant thing. Design can never be an ultimate explanation for anything. It can only be a proximate explanation. A plane or a car is explained by a designer but that's because the designer himself, the engineer, is explained by natural selection.

Those who embrace "intelligent design" -- the idea that living cells are too complex to have been created by nature alone -- say evolution isn't incompatible with the existence of God.

There is just no evidence for the existence of God. Evolution by natural selection is a process that works up from simple beginnings, and simple beginnings are easy to explain. The engineer or any other living thing is difficult to explain -- but it is explicable by evolution by natural selection. So the relevance of evolutionary biology to atheism is that evolutionary biology gives us the only known mechanism whereby the illusion of design, or apparent design, could ever come into the universe anywhere.

So why do we insist on believing in God?

From a biological point of view, there are lots of different theories about why we have this extraordinary predisposition to believe in supernatural things. One suggestion is that the child mind is, for very good Darwinian reasons, susceptible to infection the same way a computer is. In order to be useful, a computer has to be programmable, to obey whatever it's told to do. That automatically makes it vulnerable to computer viruses, which are programs that say, "Spread me, copy me, pass me on." Once a viral program gets started, there is nothing to stop it.

Similarly, the child brain is preprogrammed by natural selection to obey and believe what parents and other adults tell it. In general, it's a good thing that child brains should be susceptible to being taught what to do and what to believe by adults. But this necessarily carries the down side that bad ideas, useless ideas, waste of time ideas like rain dances and other religious customs, will also be passed down the generations. The child brain is very susceptible to this kind of infection. And it also spreads sideways by cross infection when a charismatic preacher goes around infecting new minds that were previously uninfected.

You've said that raising children in a religious tradition may even be a form of abuse.

What I think may be abuse is labeling children with religious labels like Catholic child and Muslim child. I find it very odd that in our civilization we're quite happy to speak of a Catholic child that is 4 years old or a Muslim of child that is 4, when these children are much too young to know what they think about the cosmos, life and morality. We wouldn't dream of speaking of a Keynesian child or a Marxist child. And yet, for some reason we make a privileged exception of religion. And, by the way, I think it would also be abuse to talk about an atheist child.

You are working on a new book tentatively called "The God Delusion." Can you explain it?

A delusion is something that people believe in despite a total lack of evidence. Religion is scarcely distinguishable from childhood delusions like the "imaginary friend" and the bogeyman under the bed. Unfortunately, the God delusion possesses adults, and not just a minority of unfortunates in an asylum. The word "delusion" also carries negative connotations, and religion has plenty of those.

What are its negative connotations?

A delusion that encourages belief where there is no evidence is asking for trouble. Disagreements between incompatible beliefs cannot be settled by reasoned argument because reasoned argument is drummed out of those trained in religion from the cradle. Instead, disagreements are settled by other means which, in extreme cases, inevitably become violent. Scientists disagree among themselves but they never fight over their disagreements. They argue about evidence or go out and seek new evidence. Much the same is true of philosophers, historians and literary critics.

But you don't do that if you just know your holy book is the God-written truth and the other guy knows that his incompatible scripture is too. People brought up to believe in faith and private revelation cannot be persuaded by evidence to change their minds. No wonder religious zealots throughout history have resorted to torture and execution, to crusades and jihads, to holy wars and purges and pogroms, to the Inquisition and the burning of witches.

What are the dark sides of religion today?

Terrorism in the Middle East, militant Zionism, 9/11, the Northern Ireland "troubles," genocide, which turns out to be "credicide" in Yugoslavia, the subversion of American science education, oppression of women in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and the Roman Catholic Church, which thinks you can't be a valid priest without testicles.

Fifty years ago, philosophers like Bertrand Russell felt that the religious worldview would fade as science and reason emerged. Why hasn't it?

That trend toward enlightenment has indeed continued in Europe and Britain. It just has not continued in the U.S., and not in the Islamic world. We're seeing a rather unholy alliance between the burgeoning theocracy in the U.S. and its allies, the theocrats in the Islamic world. They are fighting the same battle: Christian on one side, Muslim on the other. The very large numbers of people in the United States and in Europe who don't subscribe to that worldview are caught in the middle.

Actually, holy alliance would be a better phrase. Bush and bin Laden are really on the same side: the side of faith and violence against the side of reason and discussion. Both have implacable faith that they are right and the other is evil. Each believes that when he dies he is going to heaven. Each believes that if he could kill the other, his path to paradise in the next world would be even swifter. The delusional "next world" is welcome to both of them. This world would be a much better place without either of them.

Does religion contribute to the violence of Islamic extremists? Christian extremists?

Of course it does. From the cradle, they are brought up to revere martyrs and to believe they have a fast track to heaven. With their mother's milk they imbibe hatred of heretics, apostates and followers of rival faiths.

I don't wish to suggest it is doctrinal disputes that are motivating the individual soldiers who are doing the killing. What I do suggest is that in places like Northern Ireland, religion was the only available label by which people could indulge in the human weakness for us-or-them wars. When a Protestant murders a Catholic or a Catholic murders a Protestant, they're not playing out doctrinal disagreements about transubstantiation.

What is going on is more like a vendetta. It was one of their lot's grandfathers who killed one of our lot's grandfathers, and so we're getting our revenge. The "their lot" and "our lot" is only defined by religion. In other parts of the world it might be defined by color, or by language, but in so many parts of the world it isn't, it's defined by religion. That's true of the conflicts among Croats and the Serbs and Bosnians -- that's all about religion as labels.

The grotesque massacres in India at the time of partition were between Hindus and Muslims. There was nothing else to distinguish them, they were racially the same. They only identified themselves as "us" and the others as "them" by the fact that some of them were Hindus and some of them were Muslims. That's what the Kashmir dispute is all about. So, yes, I would defend the view that religion is an extremely potent label for hostility. That has always been true and it continues to be true to this day.

How would we be better off without religion?

We'd all be freed to concentrate on the only life we are ever going to have. We'd be free to exult in the privilege -- the remarkable good fortune -- that each one of us enjoys through having been being born. An astronomically overwhelming majority of the people who could be born never will be. You are one of the tiny minority whose number came up. Be thankful that you have a life, and forsake your vain and presumptuous desire for a second one. The world would be a better place if we all had this positive attitude to life. It would also be a better place if morality was all about doing good to others and refraining from hurting them, rather than religion's morbid obsession with private sin and the evils of sexual enjoyment.

Are there environmental costs of a religious worldview?

There are many religious points of view where the conservation of the world is just as important as it is to scientists. But there are certain religious points of view where it is not. In those apocalyptic religions, people actually believe that because they read some dopey prophesy in the book of Revelation, the world is going to come to an end some time soon. People who believe that say, "We don't need to bother about conserving forests or anything else because the end of the world is coming anyway." A few decades ago one would simply have laughed at that. Today you can't laugh. These people are in power.

Left Behind: Liberals Examine the "Religious Far Right"

Some of those aforementioned liberal activist groups held a conference in New York City this past weekend to study the weird creatures (to them at least) called "conservative Christians." The Conference, "Examining the Real Agenda of the Religious Far Right," was sponsored by the City University of New York and supported by People for the American Way, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, The Nation and The Village Voice. Attendees to the conference were regaled as speakers took a look at Christian conservative with the same attitude as renowned primatologist Jane Goodall might examine a tribe of apes. If you doubt the conference had an anti-religious tone here are the titles of some of the "discussions": Fundamentalism: The Fear and the Rage, Learning about the Christian Right, and What in the World to Do, and Christian Jihad. As reported by the Washington Times there appears to have been at least one rational speaker present, Chip Berlet, senior analyst at Political Research Associates. "Actually," Berlet was saying on Friday afternoon, "I don't like those labels at all, calling people 'religious extremists' or 'radical religious right.' You can't have a conversation when you start that way. I want to talk to these people. I want to engage them.... I want to have a real discourse about religion and politics." If more people, on both the left and right of religious politics, behaved as Mr. Berlet suggests, true dialogue on the role of religion in public life might be possible.
</quote>

All I can say to Chip Berlet, the only "rational" speaker at the conference (meaning the only one singing their party line) is:

Good luck, let me know how it goes. This will be an exercise in total frustration. Fanatics don't have dialogues. They use guilt to coerce compliance and unquestioning agreement. That's all they know how to do. It's fine to talk about a dialogue with regular Christians.....that's a good idea, in fact. But Evangelical Fundamentalist Christians in the FRC will not have a dialogue. Not unless the other party is saying what they want to hear.

Observe how the program is labeled "anti-religious" rather than something more accurate like, "anti-fanatic." Typical.

Bruce Simat, a genetics specialist from a small college in St Paul, Minnesota, wants to make one thing clear about his sceptical views on evolution. "First of all," he insists, "I'm not a cheesehead."

His defensiveness is understandable, given everything that follows in his presentation to the Kansas State Board of Education. Like almost every other witness attending a series of special hearings this week in Topeka, the Kansas state capital, Dr Simat thinks that Darwinian evolution is not a scientific theory so much as an expression of dogma -- a sort of blind faith among mainstream scientists predicated on a rejection of God as the creator of the Earth.

Dr Simat has come to Topeka to bolster the cause of Intelligent Design, a newish, relatively sophisticated variant on the old creationist theme that seeks to overturn 150 years of scientific orthodoxy and give God - or whatever else you want to call the eponymous Intelligent Designer - pride of place in the debate on the origins of humanity.

Luckily for him, he has a receptive audience. The chair of the Board of Education, Steve Abrams, is a Young Earth creationist, which is to say he believes the world was created by the Almighty no more than 6,000 years ago. The two other board members selected to attend the hearings are also Christian conservatives, who won election to their posts by pledging to insert prayer and religious principles into America's ruggedly secular public education system.

Together, the threesome is charged with approving a new set of science standards for Kansas schools. To call it a contentious issue would be a vast understatement. As far as secular groups like Kansas Citizens for Science are concerned, it is like handing control of a blood bank over to a cabal of vampires.

Do me a favor,DONT paint all conservatives or Christians with the brush you are using on this idiot.

I am both a conservative AND a Christian,and if this guy was my pastor,I would have walked out also.

This "pastor" is an idiot and does NOT deserve to lead anything,let alone a church!!

The people that walked out in protest did the right thing,and I would hope more would also decide to find another church.

I completely condemn what this pastor did,and so should every other person on this forum,no matter what your political or religious beliefs are.

Dr. Hager's Family Values
by AYELISH MCGARVEY

[from the May 30, 2005 issue]

Late last October Dr. W. David Hager, a prominent obstetrician-gynecologist and Bush Administration appointee to the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), took to the pulpit as the featured speaker at a morning service. He stood in the campus chapel at Asbury College, a small evangelical Christian school nestled among picturesque horse farms in the small town of Wilmore in Kentucky's bluegrass region. Hager is an Asburian nabob; his elderly father is a past president of the college, and Hager himself currently sits on his alma mater's board of trustees. Even the school's administrative building, Hager Hall, bears the family name.

That day, a mostly friendly audience of 1,500 students and faculty packed into the seats in front of him. With the autumn sunlight streaming through the stained-glass windows, Hager opened his Bible to the Old Testament Book of Ezekiel and looked out into the audience. "I want to share with you some information about how...God has called me to stand in the gap," he declared. "Not only for others, but regarding ethical and moral issues in our country."

For Hager, those moral and ethical issues all appear to revolve around sex: In both his medical practice and his advisory role at the FDA, his ardent evangelical piety anchors his staunch opposition to emergency contraception, abortion and premarital sex. Through his six books--which include such titles as Stress and the Woman's Body and As Jesus Cared for Women, self-help tomes that interweave syrupy Christian spirituality with paternalistic advice on women's health and relationships--he has established himself as a leading conservative Christian voice on women's health and sexuality.

And because of his warm relationship with the Bush Administration, Hager has had the opportunity to see his ideas influence federal policy. In December 2003 the FDA advisory committee of which he is a member was asked to consider whether emergency contraception, known as Plan B, should be made available over the counter. Over Hager's dissent, the committee voted overwhelmingly to approve the change. But the FDA rejected its recommendation, a highly unusual and controversial decision in which Hager, The Nation has learned, played a key role. Hager's reappointment to the committee, which does not require Congressional approval, is expected this June, but Bush's nomination of Dr. Lester Crawford as FDA director has been bogged down in controversy over the issue of emergency contraception. Crawford was acting director throughout the Plan B debacle, and Senate Democrats, led by Hillary Clinton and Patty Murray, are holding up his nomination until the agency revisits its decision about going over the counter with the pill.

When Hager's nomination to the FDA was announced in the fall of 2002, his conservative Christian beliefs drew sharp criticism from Democrats and prochoice groups. David Limbaugh, the lesser light in the Limbaugh family and author of Persecution: How Liberals Are Waging Political War Against Christianity, said the left had subjected Hager to an "anti-Christian litmus test." Hager's valor in the face of this "religious profiling" earned him the praise and lasting support of evangelical Christians, including such luminaries as Charles Colson, Dr. James Dobson and Franklin Graham, son of the Rev. Billy Graham.

Back at Asbury, Hager cast himself as a victim of religious persecution in his sermon. "You see...there is a war going on in this country," he said gravely. "And I'm not speaking about the war in Iraq. It's a war being waged against Christians, particularly evangelical Christians. It wasn't my scientific record that came under scrutiny [at the FDA]. It was my faith.... By making myself available, God has used me to stand in the breach.... Just as he has used me, he can use you."

Up on the dais, several men seated behind Hager nodded solemnly in agreement. But out in the audience, Linda Carruth Davis--co-author with Hager of Stress and the Woman's Body, and, more saliently, his former wife of thirty-two years--was enraged. "It was the most disgusting thing I've ever heard," she recalled months later, through clenched teeth.

According to Davis, Hager's public moralizing on sexual matters clashed with his deplorable treatment of her during their marriage. Davis alleges that between 1995 and their divorce in 2002, Hager repeatedly sodomized her without her consent. Several sources on and off the record confirmed that she had told them it was the sexual and emotional abuse within their marriage that eventually forced her out. "I probably wouldn't have objected so much, or felt it was so abusive if he had just wanted normal [vaginal] sex all the time," she explained to me. "But it was the painful, invasive, totally nonconsensual nature of the [anal] sex that was so horrible."

Not once during the uproar over Hager's FDA appointment did any reporter solicit the opinion of the woman now known as Linda Davis--she remarried in November 2002 to James Davis, a Methodist minister, and relocated to southern Georgia--on her husband's record, even though she contributed to much of his self-help work in the Christian arena (she remains a religious and political conservative). She intermittently thought of telling her story but refrained, she says, out of respect for her adult children. It was Hager's sermon at Asbury last October that finally changed her mind. Davis was there to hear her middle son give a vocal performance; she was prepared to hear her ex-husband inveigh against secular liberals, but she was shocked to hear him speak about their divorce when he took to the pulpit.

"In early 2002," Hager told the churchgoers that day, "my world fell apart.... After thirty-two years of marriage, I was suddenly alone in a new home that we had built as our dream home. Time spent 'doing God's will' had kept me from spending the time I needed to nourish my marriage." Hager noted with pride that in his darkest hour, Focus on the Family estimated that 50 million people worldwide were praying for him.

Linda Davis quietly fumed in her chair. "He had the gall to stand under the banner of holiness of the Lord and lie, by the sin of omission," she told me. "It's what he didn't say--it's the impression he left."

<quote>
... In tandem with his medical career, Hager has been an aggressive advocate for the political agenda of the Christian right. A member of Focus on the Family's Physician Resource Council and the Christian Medical and Dental Society, Hager assisted the Concerned Women for America in submitting a "Citizen's Petition" to the FDA in August 2002 to halt distribution and marketing of the abortion pill, RU-486. It was this record of conservative activism that ignited a firestorm when the Bush Administration first floated his name for chairman of the FDA's advisory committee in the fall of 2002. In the end, the FDA found a way to dodge the controversy: It issued a stealth announcement of Hager's appointment to the panel (to be one of eleven members, not chairman) on Christmas Eve. Liberals were furious that they weren't able to block his appointment. For many months afterward, an outraged chain letter alerting women to the appointment of a man with religious views "far outside the mainstream" snaked its way around the Internet, lending the whole episode the air of urban legend.

<quote>
... As disturbing as they are on their own, Linda Davis's allegations take on even more gravity in light of Hager's public role as a custodian of women's health. Some may argue that this is just a personal matter between a man and his former wife--a simple case of "he said, she said" with no public implications. That might be so--if there were no allegations of criminal conduct, if the alleged conduct did not bear any relevance to the public responsibilities of the person in question, and if the allegations themselves were not credible and independently corroborated. But given that this case fails all of those tests, the public has a right to call on Dr. David Hager to answer Linda Davis's charges before he is entrusted with another term. After all, few women would knowingly choose a sexual abuser as their gynecologist, and fewer still would likely be comfortable with the idea of letting one serve as a federal adviser on women's health issues.

(Lest inappropriate analogies be drawn between the Hager accusations and the politics of personal destruction that nearly brought down the presidency of Bill Clinton, it ought to be remembered that President Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky was never alleged to be criminal and did not affect his ability to fulfill his obligations to the nation. This, of course, did not stop the religious right from calling for his head. "The topic of private vs. public behavior has emerged as perhaps the central moral issue raised by Bill Clinton's 'improper relationship,'" wrote evangelist and Hager ally Franklin Graham at the time. "But the God of the Bible says that what one does in private does matter. There needs to be no clash between personal conduct and public appearance.")

Hager's FDA assignment is an object lesson in the potential influence of a single appointment to a federal advisory committee that in turn affects thousands, even millions, of lives. Witness the behind-the-scenes machinations that set the stage for the FDA's ruling against Plan B, a decision that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called a "dark stain on the reputation of an evidence-based agency like the FDA."

On December 16, 2003, twenty-seven of the FDA's advisers on women's health and nonprescription drugs gathered in Gaithersburg, Maryland, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of emergency contraception for over-the-counter use. (The Plan B pill, which drastically reduces the risk of pregnancy when used within seventy-two hours after intercourse, has long been available by prescription only; its advocates say its greater availability could significantly reduce the nation's abortion rate.) After a long day of highly technical deliberation, the advisers voted 23 to 4 to drop the prescription-only status of emergency contraception. "I've been on this committee...for almost four years, and I would take this to be the safest product that we have seen brought before us," announced Dr. Julie Johnson, a professor at the University of Florida's Colleges of Pharmacy and Medicine.

But on May 6, 2004, the FDA rejected the advice of its own experts and refused to approve the sale of Plan B over the counter. In his letter to Barr Laboratories, Steven Galson, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, claimed that Barr had not provided adequate data showing just how young adolescent women would actually use the drug.

That issue was never voted on by the committee. It was, however, broached by Hager at the meeting; he mentioned his concern for these "younger adolescents" several times.

In his private practice back in Kentucky, Hager doesn't prescribe emergency contraception, because he believes it is an abortifacient, and, not surprisingly, his was one of the four votes against widening its availability. But rather than voice his ethical opposition to the product, Hager emphasized his concern about adolescents, which other committee members have since called a "political fig leaf." According to Dr. James Trussell, who voted in favor of Plan B, the FDA had at hand six studies examining whether teens as young as 15 would increase their "risky" behavior if they knew they had a backup emergency contraceptive--and none of the studies showed any evidence for that contention.

In his sermon at Asbury College last fall, Hager proudly recounted his role in the Plan B decision. "After two days of hearings," he said, "the committees voted to approve this over-the-counter sale by 23 to 4. I was asked to write a minority opinion that was sent to the commissioner of the FDA.... Now the opinion I wrote was not from an evangelical Christian perspective.... But I argued it from a scientific perspective, and God took that information, and He used it through this minority report to influence the decision." [Emphasis added.]

None of the four panel members I spoke with for this article were aware of Hager's "minority opinion." An FDA spokeswoman told me that "the FDA did not ask for a minority opinion from this advisory committee," though she was unable to say whether any individual within the agency had requested such a document from Hager. This past January the FDA missed a deadline to respond to a new application from Barr Laboratories, and any forward motion on making Plan B more widely available has completely stalled.

Meanwhile, David Hager's stock has been rising among conservatives. Though his term on the FDA panel is set to expire on June 30, observers on both sides of the political divide anticipate his reappointment. In March I spoke with Janice Shaw Crouse, executive director and senior fellow at the Beverly LaHaye Institute, the research arm of Concerned Women for America. She is one of Hager's staunchest advocates in Washington (some credit her with engineering his FDA appointment); Crouse sits alongside Hager on Asbury College's board of trustees. In May, when informed of the allegations against him, she declined to revise her earlier statement. "I would not be at all surprised to see Dr. Hager elevated to a higher position or to another very influential position when it comes to women's care," she told me. "Because he has shown that he does care about women regardless of...the [religious] issues that people want to try to raise.... When people try to discredit him, he continues on. He hasn't caved in, and he hasn't waffled. He has been a gentleman. He is a person of character and integrity, and I think people admire that."

Just How Gay Is the Right?
By FRANK RICH
THE screen's first official gay bar," as it was labeled by the film historian Vito Russo, appeared in the 1962 political potboiler "Advise and Consent." Its most prominent visitor was a conservative United States senator.

As sheer coincidence would have it, Otto Preminger's adaptation of Allen Drury's best seller about a brutal confirmation fight was released on a sparkling new DVD last week just as the John Bolton nomination was coming to its committee vote. Like Hollywood's other riveting political movie of 1962, "The Manchurian Candidate," "Advise and Consent" is fallout from the McCarthy era: the controversial nominee for secretary of state (Henry Fonda, who else?) is a stand-in for Alger Hiss. But it may be in even less need of a remake: the intervening four decades have cast this film in a highly contemporary light.

By all rights "Advise and Consent" should be terribly dated. The cold war is now so over that the American and Russian presidents are bonding in Red Square. The film's Kennedy-era ambience - both a J.F.K. brother-in-law (Peter Lawford) and former lover (Gene Tierney) are in the cast - seems as retro as the Hula-Hoop. But when the pivotal gay plot twist kicks in, "Advise and Consent" taps into unfinished business that roils the capital as much, if not more, today than it did then. In 2005, homosexuality is no longer the love that dare not speak its name (the word is never mentioned in the movie), but as Washington fights its nuclear war over the judiciary, it is the ticking time bomb within the conservative movement that no one can defuse.

In "Advise and Consent," the handsome young senator with a gay secret (Don Murray) is from Utah - a striking antecedent of the closeted conservative Mormon lawyer in Tony Kushner's "Angels in America." For a public official to be identified as gay in the Washington of the 50's and 60's meant not only career suicide but also potentially actual suicide. Yet Drury, a staunchly anti-Communist conservative of his time, regarded the character as sympathetic, not a villain. The senator's gay affair, he wrote, was "purely personal and harmed no one else." As the historian David K. Johnson observes in "The Lavender Scare," his 2004 account of Washington's anti-gay witch hunts during the cold war era, it's the gay-baiters in Drury's novel who "are the unprincipled menace to the country, using every available tool for partisan advantage." Preminger's movie takes the same stand (though the preposterously stereotyped gay bar scene is the film's own invention).

That message remains on target now. But in the years since, even as it has ceased to be a crime or necessarily a political career-breaker to be gay, unprincipled gay-baiting has mushroomed into a full-fledged political movement. It's a virulent animosity toward gay people that really unites the leaders of the anti-"activist" judiciary crusade, not any intellectually coherent legal theory (they're for judicial activism when it might benefit them in Florida). Their campaign menaces the country on a grander scale than Drury and Preminger ever could have imagined: it uses gay people as cannon fodder on the way to its greater goal of taking down a branch of government that is crucial to the constitutional checks and balances that "Advise and Consent" so powerfully extols.

Today's judge-bashing firebrands often say that it isn't homosexuality per se that riles them, only the potential legalization of same-sex marriage by the courts. That's a sham. These people have been attacking gay people since well before Massachusetts judges took up the issue of marriage, Vermont legalized civil unions or Gavin Newsom was in grade school. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, characterizes the religious right's anti-gay campaign as a 30-year war, dating back to the late 1970's, when the Miss America runner-up Anita Bryant championed the overturning of an anti-discrimination law protecting gay men and lesbians in Dade County, Fla., and the Rev. Jerry Falwell's newly formed Moral Majority issued a "Declaration of War" against homosexuality. A quarter-century later these views remained so unreconstructed that Mr. Falwell and the Rev. Pat Robertson would go so far as to pin the 9/11 attacks in part on gay men and lesbians - a charge they later withdrew but that Mr. Robertson repositioned just two weeks ago. In response to a question from George Stephanopoulos, he said he now believes that activist judges are a more serious threat than Al Qaeda.

Their cronies are no different. As The Washington Post reported, Rick Scarborough, the Texas preacher and Tom DeLay acolyte whose "Patriot Pastor" network is a leading player in the judiciary battle, first became active in politics in 1992, when he helped oust a local high-school principal for the crime of presiding over an AIDS-awareness assembly. The American Family Association, whose leader, the Rev. Donald Wildmon, is a Scarborough ally, had been whipping up homophobia long before anyone suspected SpongeBob SquarePants of being a stalking horse (or at least a stalking sea sponge) for same-sex marriage. So-called research available on the Wildmon Web site for years - and still there as of last week - asserts that 17 percent of gay men "report eating and/or rubbing themselves with the feces of their partners" and 15 percent "report sex with animals."

Which judges do these people admire? Their patron saint is the former Alabama chief justice Roy S. Moore, best known for his activism in displaying the Ten Commandments; in a ruling against a lesbian mother in a custody case, Mr. Moore deemed homosexuality "abhorrent, immoral, detestable, a crime against nature" and suggested that the state had the power to prohibit homosexual "conduct" with penalties including "confinement and even execution." Another hero is William H. Pryor Jr., the former Alabama attorney general whose nomination to the federal bench was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. A Pryor brief to the Supreme Court on behalf of the Texas anti-sodomy law argued that decriminalized gay sex would lead to legalized necrophilia, bestiality and child pornography. It was Justice Anthony Kennedy's eloquent dismissal of such vitriol in his 2003 majority opinion striking down the Texas statute that has since made him the right's No. 1 judicial piñata.

What adds a peculiar dynamic to this anti-gay juggernaut is the continued emergence of gay people within its ranks. Allen Drury would have been incredulous if gay-baiters hounding his Utah senator had turned out to be gay themselves, but this has been a consistent pattern throughout the 30-year war. Terry Dolan, a closeted gay man, ran the National Conservative Political Action Committee, which as far back as 1980 was putting out fund-raising letters that said, "Our nation's moral fiber is being weakened by the growing homosexual movement and the fanatical E.R.A. pushers (many of whom publicly brag they are lesbians)." (Dolan recanted and endorsed gay rights before he died of AIDS in 1986.) The latest boldface name to marry his same-sex partner in Massachusetts is Arthur Finkelstein, the political operative behind the electoral success of Jesse Helms, a senator so homophobic he voted in the minority of the 97-to-3 reauthorization of the Ryan White act for AIDS funding and treatment in 1995.

But surely the most arresting recent case is James E. West, the powerful Republican mayor of Spokane, Wash., whose double life has just been exposed by the local paper, The Spokesman-Review. Mr. West's long, successful political career has been distinguished by his attempts to ban gay men and lesbians from schools and day care centers, to fire gay state employees, to deny City Hall benefits to domestic partners and to stifle AIDS-prevention education. The Spokesman-Review caught him trolling gay Web sites for young men and trying to lure them with gifts and favors. (He has denied accusations of abusing boys when he was a Boy Scout leader some 25 years ago.) Not unlike the Roy Cohn of "Angels in America" - who describes himself as "a heterosexual man" who has sex "with guys" - Mr. West has said he had "relations with adult men" but doesn't "characterize" himself as gay. This is more than hypocrisy - it's pathology.

ALLEN Drury might not have known what to make of Mr. West or of another odd tic in the 30-year war, the recurrent emergence of gay-baiting ideologues with openly gay children ( Phyllis Schlafly, Randall Terry, Alan Keyes ). According to Mr. Johnson's fresh scholarship in "The Lavender Scare," a likely inspiration for the gay plot line in Drury's "Advise and Consent" was the real-life story of a Wyoming Democrat, Lester Hunt, who shot himself in his Senate office in 1954 after the Republican Campaign Committee threatened to make an issue of his gay son's arrest in Lafayette Park on "morals charges." Those were the dark ages, but it isn't entirely progress that we now have a wider war on gay people, thinly disguised as a debate over the filibuster, cloaked in religion, and counting among its shock troops politicians as utterly bereft of moral bearings as James West. Check out the good old days in "Advise and Consent," not to mention Charles Laughton's valedictory performance as a Bible Belt senator who ultimately puts patriotism over partisanship, and weep.

Secular Conservative Philanthropies waging unethical campaign to take over United Methodist Church

by Andrew J. Weaver and Nicole Seibert
for Mediatransparency.org

POSTED AUGUST 2, 2004 --

The United Methodist and other mainline Protestant churches are the targets of a continuing, orchestrated attack by determined right-wing ideologues who use CIA-style propaganda methods to sow dissention and distrust, all in pursuit of a radical political agenda.

The leader of this attack is an organization called the Institute on Religion and Democracy (IRD), a pseudo-religious think-tank that carries out the goals of its secular funders that are opposed to the churches' historic social witness.

The IRD works in concert with other self-styled "renewal" groups like Good News and the Confessing Movement. IRD answers only to its own self-perpetuating board of directors, most of whom are embedded in the secular political right (Howell, 1995).

In the January/February 2004 issue of Zion's Herald, we published a special report on the activities of the IRD. We documented how it is primarily funded by right-wing secular foundations. We showed the interlocking relationships between IRD, Good News and the Confessing Movement, and demonstrated how the latter amplify the nonsense eminating from IRD by publishing its distortions and falsehoods about UMC leaders and programs (Howell, 2003). IRD's underlying strategy is to delegitimize existing church leadership in the eyes of their own members, and to thereby cause schism in the church (Swomley, 1989).

These three so-called "renewal" groups repeatedly seek to justify their attacks by claiming that a decline in membership in our church and other mainline denominations is the fault of "liberals" who involved the church in social action, and that they are needed to repair the damage (IRD, 2001a; Tooley, 2003; Case, 2003).

The problem with this assertion, which is used ad nauseam by all three groups, is that it is simply not true. Social-scientific evidence shows that the decline in membership in mainline churches over the past 70 years and the growth of conservative churches is the direct consequence of conservative church members having more children. According to several leading experts in the sociology of religion, who published their findings in the American Journal of Sociology, "switching from mainline to conservative denominations... explains none of the decline of mainline denominations" (Hout, Greely, and Wilde, 2001).

IRD directors are on the boards and actively involved in other ultra-conservative groups including the Project for the New American Century, Institute on Religion and Public Life, National Taxpayers Union, Concerned Women for America, Ethics and Public Policy Center, and American Enterprise Institute.

The IRD board members operate and have access to conservative publications and media such as First Things, Good News, Christianity Today, Washington Times, The Weekly Standard and Fox News. IRD also has the same group of benefactors that regularly contribute to radical-right causes such as the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the Smith Richardson Foundation, the John M. Olin Foundation, the California billionaire Howard Ahmanson and the Sarah Scaife Foundation (Blumenthal, 2004; Cooperman, 2003; Howell, 1995).

A major portion of IRD's funding, from its inception, has come from right-wing billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife. Since its founding in 1982, the IRD has received more than $1.9 million from the Scaife foundations, including an initial startup grant of $200,000 (Howell, 2003; Media Transparency, 2003). In the early years of operation, 89 percent of the funds came from conservative foundations (The Public Eye, 1989) and most of its money continues to come from similar sources (Howell, 2003).

In the early 1970s Scaife was recruited as a front man and bankroller for the CIA's London-based "news service", Forum World Features (Conason and Lyons, 2000). At Forum, Scaife sponsored and directed what his long-time CIA friend who recruited him, Frank Barnett, calls "political warfare." Barnett wrote:

"Political warfare in short, is warfare--not public relations. It is one part persuasion and two parts deception.... The aim of political warfare...is to discredit, displace, and neutralize an opponent, to destroy a competing ideology, and to reduce the adherents to political impotence. It is to make one's own values prevail by working the levers of power, as well as by using persuasion." (Barnett, 1961).

Forum's covert activities were eventually exposed by the press and in Congressional investigations into the CIA ( Conason and Lyons, 2000). A whistle-blowing British army intelligence officer told how Forum had assisted in right-wing "dirty tricks" operations including spreading "smear stories" about Prime Minister Harold Wilson and a dozen other prominent Labor members of Parliament in an effort to elect a Conservative government. Managing the finances for Scaife was Robert Gene Gately, a CIA officer who later headed the CIA station in Bangkok (Conason and Lyons, 2000).

Scaife has carried his political warfare campaign into the present day. His instrument of dissemination is no longer a foreign news service, now it is propaganda "think tanks" like IRD.

According to California-based investigative reporter Matt Smith,

"IRD and its allies' use of right-wing nonreligious foundation money to smear liberal church leaders through mailings, articles in IRD-aligned publications, press releases, and stories in secular newspapers and magazines has more in common with a CIA Third World destabilization campaign than ordinary civilized debate." (Smith, 2004)

Although only six of the 23 IRD board members are affiliated with the UMC, the UMC is the primary target of this undermining operation. IRD focuses its principal expenditures and most of its efforts on The United Methodist Church. Between 1999-2002 it spent $1,451,509 (almost half of its total program expenditures) on "monitoring" and attacking the UMC's activities, leadership and public policy statements (GuideStar, 2003).

IRD was founded 23 years ago by three key leaders of the radical-right neoconservative movement that now dominates the George W. Bush administration, namely Roman Catholics Richard John Neuhaus and Michael Novak and the unchurched Penn Kemble (Clarkson, 1997).

Neuhaus acknowledged that the IRD had a specific "political agenda" from the beginning -- Central America and opposition to liberation theology were top concerns (Lernoux, 1989). Kemble was a key player in the Iran-Contra scandal working as an agent between Oliver North and U.S. financial backers of the Nicaraguan Contras (Goshko, 1989; Massing, 1989). A House of Representatives investigation of Kemble's activities during the Iran-Contra Affair revealed that IRD worked with the State Department's Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean. It was a special office supervised by the National Security Council, which produced propaganda supporting Reagan's Central America policies. (House Foreign Affairs Committee, 1988).

Kemble was quoted in newspapers at the time as saying that "liberal leaders of America's mainline Protestant churches had frustrated the CIA's efforts to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government" (Smith, 2004). Novak was one of the directors of the Nicaraguan Freedom Fund, an endowment started in 1985 by the Unification Church-owned Washington Times to provide financial support for the Nicaraguan Contras (Isikoff, 1985).

In its early years, IRD worked intimately with the Reagan White House, providing papers, speeches and even co-sponsored a conference with the State Department assailing the theological integrity of Catholic clergy ministering and living among impoverished peasants in Central America (Public Eye, 1989; Hyer, 1985). It routinely challenged the patriotism of any Christians who did not share its aggressive interventionist goals.

IRD also vigorously defended the moral authority of the Reagan administration's brutal policies in the region which was fueled by money and weapons secretly funneled to right-wing death squads and later exposed in the Iran-Contra hearings (Diamond, 1989; Hyer, 1985). IRD assailed mainline Protestant leaders who showed support for the Nicaraguan government while trying to tie the National Council of Churches (NCC) and the World Council of Churches to the "terrorists" who were often Catholic priests and laity trying to organize the poverty stricken peasants of Central America (Diamond, 1989).

The death toll during the Reagan presidency was staggering -- with more than 200,000 political killings in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua alone (D'Escoto, 2004). Following the lead of the Reagan White House, IRD christened the military forces that carried out the violence, including the documented murder of hundreds of Catholic priests and nuns, as "freedom fighters" (Lernoux, 1991). Ronald Reagan described the Contra "death squads" in Nicaragua as "the moral equal of our founding fathers." The links between IRD and the first-term Reagan administration earned the IRD the moniker of "the official seminary of the White House" (Lernoux, 1989).

By the end of the 1980s IRD needed a new raison d'être. Its primary target became three mainstream Protestant churches, the very ones that had given it the most resistance in the years it attacked progressive forces in Central America. The United Methodists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians replaced the Nicaraguans, El Salvadorians and Guatemalans.

Allied with so-called "renewal" groups like Good News and its wealthy patrons, IRD set its sights on orchestrating a hostile takeover of the UMC and other mainline churches (Howell, 2003). The institute's Reforming America's Churches Project aims to "restructure the permanent governing structure" of "theologically flawed" mainline churches like the UMC in order to "discredit and diminish the Religious Left's influence" (IRD, 2001a). To do so it systematically spreads misleading and inflammatory charges against organizations and leaders, as well as employing the propaganda method of "wedge issues" like abortion and homosexuality, to cause distraction and division (Howell, 2003; Lomperis, 2004).

At the same time IRD continued to promote the radical right foreign and domestic policy agendas of the neoconservative movement that gave it birth. Its mission has closely tracked the neoconservative agenda over the past two decades - moving from militant anticommunism to post-cold war American global domination to radical anti-taxation for the rich and destruction of the meager social safety-net for the poor and middle-class (Tooley, 2001a; IRD, 2001a).

IRD routinely attacks the patriotism and theological integrity of any United Methodist leaders who do not share its blatant jingoism and Biblical fundamentalism (Howell, 2003; Lomperis, 2004). When several respected bishops and other leaders in the UMC questioned the wisdom of the preemptive invasion of Iraq, IRD published a hate-filled commentary accusing them of "worship at the altar of the United Nations," giving "aid and comfort" to our enemies, and having "hatred for President Bush and for America itself" (Berg, 2003).

In November of 2001, IRD featured an editorial entitled "Methodism and Patriotism" (Tooley, 2001b). In the commentary Mark Tooley, executive director of IRD's United Methodist monitoring program, a former CIA analyst and a board member of Good News, questioned the loyalty and patriotism of a host of UMC leaders in the of wake of September 11. He wrote:

"I have had the opportunity to observe not only the bishops' meeting, but also directors' meetings of the United Methodist Board of Church and Society and the Board of Global Ministries . The visual contrast between these meetings and the scene around the rest of the country was striking. Everywhere else I have seen the American flag proudly flying from houses, bridges, and cars. But at all of the national United Methodist meetings I attended this fall, involving several hundred denominational leaders, I saw only one individual who displayed a flag." (Tooley, 2001b).
He went on:

"The blindness and ingratitude of our United Methodist officials when it comes to our country should cause us sorrow they cannot really enjoy our church any more than they enjoy our country, because inwardly they feel superior to most of its members. Meanwhile, we ordinary members of the church can savor the gifts, including the gift of country." (Tooley, 2001b)

Notice the twisted argumentation here. Tooley claims that our duly elected and consecrated United Methodist bishops are secretly disdainful elites who do not care for either their church or nation and are not to be trusted by church members. (Forget the fact that many bishops and other leaders are combat veterans or have had family members who have been killed or wounded in war.) Again, IRD's propaganda patterns are more akin to techniques CIA operatives used during the Reagan years to destabilize leaders in Third World nations than civil discourse in the Christian church.

In addition, IRD lacks journalistic ethics. According to respected Bishop Kenneth L. Carder of Mississippi, who was spuriously named in "Methodism and Patriotism" as one who was not properly respectful of God or country, Tooley acted without ethics in his interactions with the bishop. Tooley contacted Bishop Carder, asking him if he wished to respond to IRD's attack prior to publication. Before Bishop Carder could respond, Tooley published it. According to Bishop Carder, Tooley had no intention of being fair or balanced in his article, nor did he have the intention of giving the bishop a chance to refute the false claims (Carder, 2004). The bishop said:

"I challenged Mark Tooley's tactics as a violation of basic Christian discipleship and invited him to enter a confidential mutual covenant to hold one another accountable for our discipleship and faithfulness to the Wesleyan tradition. I shared with him that his article and the tactics used violated the stated purpose of the IRD as 'protecting faith and freedom.' He refused to enter such a covenant." (Carder, 2004).

In October of 2002, IRD along with other denominational so-called "renewal" groups convened in Indianapolis for the "Confessing the Faith National Conference." It was heralded by James Heidinger, president of Good News, and Thomas Oden the chair of the Board of Directors of IRD, who declared it "the first-ever gathering of Evangelical, Confessing and Renewing Christians in the Mainline Churches of North America" (Confessing The Faith National Conference, 2002). Oden and the president of IRD, Diane Knippers, were keynote speakers, along with key leaders of the Confessing Movement, Maxie Dunnam and chair of the board William Hinson.

The conference was attended by Kevin Jones, an Episcopal businessman and award-winning religious news reporter. (Jones, 2004) Jones wrote a stinging report about the conference that ought to be read by everyone concerned about the right-wing attack on mainline churches (Jones, 2002). He found that he could obtain tapes recordings of all the conference sessions except the political strategy gatherings which he attended. The strategy sessions laid out clandestine and devious tactics for gaining power within the mainline denominations.

Jones discovered in these sessions a dedicated group whose proposed methods lacked basic scruples. The group discussed strategies of deception and deceitfulness to employ in their hostile takeover bids. Seminaries and Sunday schools were listed as priority targets (Jones, 2002). They were advised to present themselves as a "winsome witness" that is "a soft and friendly face to the public," but fight "tooth and nail on an issue." There was absolutely no talk of splitting or leaving the church. "They are convinced they are right and are willing to work long and hard to reclaim what they think is theirs." He found out that the threat of a split from the churches "is a scam" (Jones, 2002).

Jones wrote:

"When they use the language of splitting or schism, they want to scare their target and ours, the 'Movable Middle.' Like a lot of political speech it's not what they say, but the effect of what they say that we should look at. If they raise the fear of a split it could freeze the 'Movable Middle...'" (Jones, 2002)
One tactic they advised was to "divert focus from issues important to progressives." The issue of Sudanese Christian human rights was explicitly recommended as a diversionary device. "Sudan serves two purposes," Jones was cynically told at the conference: "It diverts attention away from Palestine and Israel and allows them to make common cause with progressives on a human rights issue." Their goal is to place "progressives into internally conflicted positions" (Jones, 2002). Who could possibly be against human rights for persecuted Christians in the Sudan?

IRD touts its "Religious Liberty Program" as central to its mission and especially its advocacy for Sudanese Christians. It states in its IRS declarations that it "monitors and reports on religious liberty issues worldwide," and since 1999 has indicated a "focus on persecution in Sudan" (GuideStar, 2003). On its website it makes impassioned plies for the Sudanese Christians who face the real horrors of slavery, mass murder and starvation. IRD indicates in its IRS report that it spent over 3.5 million dollars ($3,586,783) between 1999 and 2002. During that same period, IRD gave a grand total of $20,640 in grants to the persecuted Sudanese (GuideStar, 2003). That is less than $6,000 of each million it spent. Compare that to the $78,000 it paid in 1999 alone to Univision, a telemarketing company in Canada, to solicit new donors (GuideStar, 2003). Some priority. Some compassion.

Despite the fact that IRD gives a pittance of its resources in direct aid to the Sudanese people, it makes its professed concern media visible. In February of 2000 IRD announced in Christianity Today that it was organizing ongoing protests against the Clinton Administration's policy in Sudan at the gates of the State Department. Faith McDonnell, director of the Religious Liberty Program and the Church Alliance for a New Sudan at IRD, said she was "looking for church groups willing to participate, including, in each, a person prepared to be arrested" (Strode, 2000). The call for protest and civil disobedience is as American as apple pie and to speak up for persecuted people is a worthy, even noble calling.

The only problem is that when respected leaders in the UMC and NCC exercise the same citizen's right of dissent, they are roundly castigated by IRD (Tooley, 2002). When courageous Christians, including UMC bishops, protested the "shock and awe" invasions of the Bush administration, IRD labeled the dissenters "politically correct" interlopers practicing "convenient pacifism" (Knippers, 2003). IRD says fellow Christians only reduce serious debates to "superficial, even deceptive slogans and arguments" while showing "embarrassing naiveté" as they "spout pacifist-sounding slogans" (Knippers, 2003; Wisdom, 2003).

IRD directs Christians to trust the country's military and political leaders rather than to question them. "Church leaders are wrong to speak on matters about which they lack the information and competence," wrote Wisdom, "... in the case of war against Iraq, those grave decisions must finally be made by government and military leaders within their spheres of competence and authority" (Wisdom, 2003). IRD tells the church to actively protest government policy in the Sudan, but when it come to questions of war and peace we should simply trust and obey government officials (Wisdom, 2003).

Diane Knippers, president of IRD, actually tries to make the bizarre argument that "theologians and clerics" should not enter the debate about questions of war and peace (Knippers, 2003). Is she saying that the Rev. John Wesley was out of bounds when he repeatedly spoke out against war and excessive military spending in the 18th century (Stone, 2001)? John Wesley who abhorred the cruelty and self-indulgence of war and vehemently objected when his government used the method of war to resolve its conflicts wrote:

"But, whatever be the cause, let us calmly and impartially consider the thing itself. Here are forty thousand men gathered together on this plain. What are they going to do? See, there are thirty or forty thousand more at a little distance. And these are going to shoot them through the head or body, to stab them, or split their skulls, and send most of their souls into everlasting fire, as fast as they possibly can. Why so? What harm have they done to them? O none at all! They do not so much as know them. But a man, who is King of France, has a quarrel with another man, who is King of England. So these Frenchmen are to kill as many of these Englishmen as they can, to prove the King of France is in the right. Now, what an argument is this! What a method of proof! What an amazing way of deciding controversies! What must mankind be, before such a thing as war could ever be known or thought of upon earth? How shocking, how inconceivable a want must there have been of common understanding, as well as common humanity, before any two Governors, or any two nations in the universe, could once think of such a method of decision? If, then, all nations, Pagan, Mahometan, and Christian, do, in fact, make this their last resort, what farther proof do we need of the utter degeneracy of all nations from the plainest principles of reason and virtue?" (Wesley, 1757).
More importantly, Jesus Christ in the Gospels, which IRD appears to want to ignore, emphatically oppose retaliation and affirms love for the enemy. To one of his disciples, who tried to prevent him from being arrested by using a sword, Jesus said, "Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword" (Mt. 26:52). Knowing the effects of the vicious cycle of violence, Jesus refused to use force to stop violence. Instead, he showed us the surest way to an authentic triumph over violence: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God" (Mt. 5:9).

The theologian Schubert M. Ogden recently wrote in personal correspondence in reference to "some of those who are leaders in the conservative forces within the UMC (as well as some of their colleagues in other denominations and confessions)." "Their pride and arrogance are only too evident from their carelessness in the means they're willing to employ and in their lack of charity toward those whom they treat, not as brothers and sisters in Christ, or even as fellow-members of God's original, all-inclusive covenant, but simply as enemies to be outmaneuvered and overcome." (Ogden, 2004).

<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_21/b3934001_mz001.htm">Business Week has a title story</a> on evangelical marketing strategies, which confirms much of what Lola has said here. (Of course, that won't stop me from disagreeing with her just for the fun of it.) Their journalistic hook is a reverend called Joel Osteen from Houston and the ways he creates brand loyalty.

<quote>
To keep them coming back, Lakewood offers free financial counseling, low-cost bulk food, even a "fidelity group" for men with "sexual addictions." Demand is brisk for the self-help sessions. Angie Mosqueda, 34, who was brought up a Catholic, says she and her husband, Mark, first went to Lakewood in 2000 when they were on the brink of a divorce. Mark even threw her out of the house after she confessed to infidelity. But over time, Lakewood counselors "really helped us to forgive one another and start all over again," she says.

Disney Look
Osteen's flourishing Lakewood enterprise brought in $55 million in contributions last year, four times the 1999 amount, church officials say. Flush with success, Osteen is laying out $90 million to transform the massive Compaq Center in downtown Houston -- former home of the NBA's Houston Rockets -- into a church that will seat 16,000, complete with a high-tech stage for his TV shows and Sunday School for 5,000 children. After it opens in July, he predicts weekend attendance will rocket to 100,000. Says Osteen: "Other churches have not kept up, and they lose people by not changing with the times."

Pastor Joel is one of a new generation of evangelical entrepreneurs transforming their branch of Protestantism into one of the fastest-growing and most influential religious groups in America. Their runaway success is modeled unabashedly on business. They borrow tools ranging from niche marketing to MBA hiring to lift their share of U.S. churchgoers. Like Osteen, many evangelical pastors focus intently on a huge potential market -- the millions of Americans who have drifted away from mainline Protestant denominations or simply never joined a church in the first place.

I don't expect the article to tell Lola much she doesn't know. But for me, it's evidence from a not exactly socialist source that I had underestimated what a thriving and profitable business Evangelical Protestantism is. Maybe I have underestimated other aspects of it too; and maybe the article teaches one reader or another something new as well.

I don't know much about Osteen. I know here in New York he filled Madison Square Garden to capacity for two performances. He's not a bad guy. His message is a positive one, avoiding guilt provocation. But the mega church phenomenon is amazing. I'll read the article tomorrow.

Take a look at this item and relate to the earlier BW article you posted....

<quote>
The U.S. House of Representatives had to do a fair amount of trimming to get the $31.8 billion Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill into shape for Tuesday night's vote; lawmakers reduced the department's overall funding request by seven percent. One intriguing item that was stripped from Homeland Security's proposed 2006 budget: the $136,000 the department was paying TV actress Bobbie Faye Ferguson, a former "Dukes of Hazzard" guest star, to be its image consultant.

As Richard Hofstadter put it (for an earlier period), we've seen the shift from "New Dealer" to "Car Dealer".

It ought not to be surprising, I suppose, that American politics has become as commercialized as this. George Orwell did a good study of the mechanics of totalitarianism, but he didn't mention that the characters involved would be vaccum cleaner salesmen with flaming Napoleonic complexes, omen-reading madmen, and hordes infatuated with the thrill and purpose of hating.

Not really. I think I remember a passage in Tocqueville where he describes some 19th century equivalent of it. I'm even surer I remember Mark Twain describe some very business-oriented (and not very honest) priests, I think in Huckleberry Finn. Granted, these priests did not agitate politically, but I'm still not sure I agree with your "become". If there's a change here, it's a very incremental one.

Really? I'd be curious to hear in what way it was unbelievable.

Another thing the article has made me curious about: If the barriers to entry into the megachurch business are as low as the article suggests, has anyone tried to start up a liberal-minded megachurch yet? After all, the marketing interface the existing ones use seems to be quite generally applicable, so I don't see why it should work only for fundamentalist evangelicals.

I listened to a fascinating interview this morning.

I'm going to be looking for the book next week (is it available in Canada yet?)

<quote>
A little over three years ago, the Sunday Edition went to Washington, DC to explore the politics of president George W. Bush. Michael sat with Pastor Jim Wallis in his living room in Washington's inner city to watch President Bush's State of the Union address. Jim Wallis is an evangelican leader. He founded a Christian group called Sojourners which advocates peace and social justice.

Michael's intro:

As Jim and I watched the president deliver his promises to battle terror in the world and rebuild Afghanistan, our conversation turned to what was missing from the lexicon of the Republicans. Mister Wallis said that one glaring omission was any promise to deal with poverty - in fact, he said that at a meeting with religious leaders from across the United States., the president confided that he just didn't "get' the kind of poverty surrounding Jim Wallis only twenty blocks from the White House. And poverty is just one element missing from President Bush's plan, according to Mister Wallis. In his new Book, God's Politics: Why the Right Gets it Wrong and the Left doesn't Get it (pub. Harper San Francisco), Jim Wallis argues that the politics of Christ and Christianity is missing in just about every sphere of American political life. And he says that must change. Jim Wallis joined us from a studio in Boulder, Colorado.

Secular liberals and religious conservatives will find things to both comfort and alarm them in Jim Wallis's God's Politics. That combination is actually reason enough to recommend the book in a time when the national political and theological discourse is dominated by blanket descriptions and shortsightedness. But Wallis, editor of Sojourners magazine, offers more than just a book that's hard to categorize. What Wallis sees as the true mission of Christianity--righting social ills, working for peace--is in tune with the values of liberals who so often run screaming from the idea of religion. Meanwhile, in his estimation, religious vocabulary is co-opted by conservatives who use it to polarize. Wallis proposes a new sort of politics, the name of which serves as the title of the book, wherein these disparities are reconciled and progressive causes are paired with spiritual guidance for the betterment of society. Wallis is at his most compelling when he puts this theory into action himself, letting his own beliefs guide him through stinging criticisms of the war in Iraq. In his view, George W. Bush's flaw lies in the assumption that the United States was an unprecedented force of goodness in a fight against enemies characterized as "evil." Indeed, although both the right and left are criticized here, the idea is that the liberals, if they would get religion, are the more redeemable lot. Wallis's line between religion and public policy may be drawn a little differently than most liberals might feel comfortable with, and while he pays some lip service to other faiths most of his prescription for America seems to come from the Bible. Still, for a party having just lost a presidential election where "moral issues" are said to have factored heavily, God's Politics is a sermon worth listening to.

Terry Fox is pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church.

Joe Wright is pastor of of Central Christian Church. He famously opened up the Kansas House of Representatives with this prayer in 1996

<quote>
When minister Joe Wright was asked to open the new sessions of the Kansas Senate, everyone was expecting the usual generalities, but this is what they heard:

THE PRAYER

Heavenly Father, we come before you today to ask Your forgiveness and to seek Your direction and guidance. We know Your Word says, "Woe to those who call evil good,," but that is exactly what we have done. We have lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed our values.

We confess:

We have ridiculed the absolute truth of Your Word and called it Pluralism.
We have worshipped other gods and called it multiculturalism.
We have endorsed perversion and called it alternative lifestyle.
We have exploited the poor and called it the lottery.
We have rewarded laziness and called it welfare.
We have killed our unborn and called it choice.
We have shot abortionists and called it justifiable.
We have neglected to discipline our children and called it building self-esteem.
We have abused power and called it politics.
We have coveted our neighbor's possessions and called it ambition.
We have polluted the air with profanity and pornography and called it freedom of expression.
We have ridiculed the time-honored values of our forefathers and called it enlightenment.

Search us, Oh God, and know our hearts today; cleanse us from every sin and set us free.

Guide and bless these men and women who have been sent to direct us to the center of your will. I ask it in the Name of Your Son, the living Savior, Jesus Christ.

Amen.

The response was immediate. A number of legislators walked out during the prayer in protest. In six short weeks, Central Christian Church, where Rev. Wright is pastor, logged more than 5,000 phone calls with only 47 of those calls responding negatively. The church is now receiving international requests for copies of this prayer from India, Africa, and Korea.

Commentator Paul Harvey aired this prayer on "The Rest of the Story" on the radio and received a larger response to this program than any other he has ever aired.

Special Report
"Follow the Money"
Documenting the Right's Well-Heeled Assault on the UMC
-Andrew J. Weaver and Nicole Seibert

Six months ago, we reviewed in these pages an unsettling book titled United Methodism @ Risk: A Wake Up Call by Leon Howell (see Zion's Herald, July/August 2003). The book exposes an orchestrated attack by the American political and religious right on The United Methodist Church (UMC) and other mainline Protestant denominations that have been sufficiently vigorous, socially involved and politically effective to garner its wrath (Howell, 2003).

In response to the ensuing criticism of the book and our review, we organized a group of researchers to check the facts and found the volume to be well documented and reliable. In the process, we also reviewed hundreds of documents published by the key organization involved in the assault on the church, namely, the Institute on Religion and Democracy (IRD). Our findings as outlined below are very disturbing.

The IRD is affiliated with no denomination and is only accountable to its own self-appointed, self-perpetuating board of directors. According to public sources, the IRD focuses its principal expenditures and most of its efforts on The United Methodist Church. In 2001, it spent $358,667 (46 percent of its total program expenditures) on "monitoring" the UMC's activities, leadership and public policy statements. In 1999, it spent $337,636 for the same purpose - more than six times what it spent on its "religious liberty" program that it declares in IRS documents to be its primary purpose (GuideStar, 2002).

From its inception in 1982, IRD has been generously funded primarily by ultra-conservative organizations (Media Transparency, 2003). Records show that since it was founded, the IRD has received more than $1.9 million from the Scaife foundations, including an initial start-up grant of $200,000 (The Public Eye, 1989). The Scaife Family Foundations, managed by Richard Mellon Scaife, gave $225,000 to the IRD in 2002 for its "Reforming America's Churches Project" - among whose stated goals is the elimination of the UMC's General Board of Church and Society, the church's voice for justice and peace, as well as discrediting UMC pastors and bishops with whom they disagree by instigating church trials (Information Project for United Methodists, 2003). With respect to church trials, the IRD states the following in a fund-raising document to donors: "Over the next three years, we expect involvement in at least a dozen different cases around the country" (Institute on Religion and Democracy, 2001a).

The significance of the Scaife family's support of the IRD is best understood in the context of their foundations' overall pattern of funding. Richard Mellon Scaife, who controls the foundations' funds, is a billionaire who has subsidized many of the political right's formative institutions and organizations during the past 30 years (Rothmyer, 2000). His wealth was inherited from the Mellon banking and oil fortune.

In 1999 equivalent dollars, the Washington Post calculated that Mr. Scaife gave to conservative causes and institutions some $620 million during that 30-year period (Kaiser &amp; Chinoy, 1999). In the 1990s, Mr. Scaife supported groups with millions of dollars to fund lawsuits against the Clinton administration on a multitude of issues. In a revealing interview in 1999 with John F. Kennedy, Jr., in George Magazine, Mr. Scaife claimed that the Clintons were involved in the deaths of 60 friends and employees - bizarre accusations that have never been taken seriously in a court of law nor been shown to have a basis in fact (Kennedy, 1999).

The Scaife family, however, is not alone in funding the IRD. California-based Fieldstead and Company is the conduit for the interests of Howard Fieldstead Ahmanson, whose father amassed a fortune in the savings-and-loan industry. Howard Ahmanson and his wife, Roberta, who serves on the IRD board of directors, have been key supporters of Chalcedon Inc., the Christian Reconstructionist think tank where Howard Ahmanson served on the board of directors for 23 years (Olsen, 1998). Christian Reconstructionism is a hard-line Calvinist movement that advocates replacing American democracy with a fundamentalist theocracy under strict biblical codes. For example, they would impose the death penalty "by stoning" on everyone from adulterers and homosexuals to incorrigible children and those who spread "false" religions (Robinson, 2002). Ahmanson gave IRD $58,960 in 1991 and $234,135 in 1992 (Howell, 1995) and according to an IRD disclosure recently made to the Washington Post, Ahmanson continues to give on average $75,000 a year (Cooperman, 2003).

Other IRD funding sources include the John M. Olin Foundation, whose namesake manufactured Winchester rifles; Olin has backed the IRD in the amount of $489,000 "to counter the political influence of the Religious Left." The Castle Rock Foundation, created by the Adolph Coors family in 1993, gave $90,000 to IRD to "challenge the orthodoxy promoted by liberal religious leaders in the U.S." The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, funded by a family with ties to the ultra-conservative John Birch Society, gave $1.5 million between 1985 and 2001 to IRD efforts (Media Transparency, 2003). The Bradley Foundation's stated objective is to return the U.S. to the days before government regulated business and corporations were required to negotiate with labor unions (Media Transparency, 2003).

How significant is the relationship between the IRD and this secular-funding base? Between 1985-2002, the IRD ranked 81st in money received on a list of 2609 recipients of funding from right-wing organizations ( Media Transparency, 2003). The National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy published a report in 1997 showing how a dozen foundations have prevailed in shaping public policy. It found that the organizations that fund the IRD (and a few others) diverge in their practices from the generally accepted social and ethical norms of the philanthropic sector (National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, 1997). According to this report, the IRD-supporting foundations' agendas include the aggressive furthering of public policy that favors the wealthy and the use of government power to support corporate interests and laissez-faire capitalism (Media Transparency, 2003).

What does this all mean? At the very least, we can say that the IRD, by uncritically accepting funds from such organizations, tacitly approves of their agendas. Conversely, it would appear obvious that the IRD would not receive funding from such groups were it opposed to their objectives.

The IRD's stated goals, which consistently are at odds with the historic social witness of the mainline churches, include increasing military spending, opposing environmental protection efforts and eliminating social welfare programs (Institute on Religion and Democracy, 2001a). In this respect, it can be said that the IRD and its wealthy patrons are intent on derailing if not outright controlling the UMC's social witness. If that sounds implausible, one need only consider how right-wing groups during the last decade have done that and more in their take-over of the Southern Baptist Convention.

How do they operate in pursuit of their goals? The IRD's modus operandi is to vilify and ridicule UMC officials, organizations and programs that do not reflect its views. For example, in March of 2001, the IRD demonstrated utter contempt for United Methodist bishops in an assault on their collective judgment and integrity; this was published on the Good News Web site under the title, "The Methodist President and His Bishops" (Tooley, 2001a). Mark Tooley, executive director of IRD's United Methodist monitoring program, a former CIA analyst and a board member of Good News, called the bishops en masse "fatuous" and "pompous." According to Mr. Tooley, "statements from United Methodist bishops are often inarticulate and sometimes downright nonsensical." He was particularly agitated by their unanimous vote questioning the proposed expenditure of tens of billions of dollars by the Bush Administration on a "Star Wars" missile defense system that is without proven scientific merit (PBS, 2003). He also was scornful of the bishops when they expressed concern for "children and the poor," who, according to the bishops, are being impoverished as a result of excessive military expenditures (Tooley, 2001a).

The IRD hardly has a good word to say about any United Methodist leaders. For example, when Duke University adopted a policy (supported by both North Carolina bishops) that students and their families could use the university chapel for same-sex blessings by churches that permit them, Mr. Tooley and the IRD unleashed an attack on the Rev. Dr. William Willimon (Willimon, 2001). Dr. Willimon is the Dean of the Chapel at Duke and a widely respected leader within the UMC community and beyond. When he contacted the IRD to report that he and his secretary were receiving hate mail and pornographic materials in the name of the IRD's protest, Mr. Tooley wrote back saying, "If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen." Mr. Tooley stated that he had no interest in talking further with Dr. Willimon until he resigned from Duke (Willimon, 2003).

Dr. Willimon is in good company. IRD has attacked, among others, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Rev. Jim Wallis of Sojourners, the evangelical leader Dr. Tony Campolo, the National Council of Catholic Bishops, the UMC's Igniting Ministry public relations campaign (Bowdon, 2001), the UMC's newest hymnal (McIntyre, 2001) and numerous other distinguished Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish leaders and programs (United Methodists Affirming Christ's Teachings in our Nation, 2003; UM Action, 2000).

There's more. For example, when the Interfaith Alliance was formed during the 1990s as a progressive multi-faith group to counter the bullying of the Christian Coalition and others on the religious right, Mr. Tooley took exception. He was upset that prominent and respected Americans like Walter Cronkite were trying to help the multi-faith group (Neuhaus, 1997). Perhaps harking back to his cold-warrior days in the CIA, Mr. Tooley likened several Christian and Jewish leaders to communist stooges: "The Interfaith Alliance's board is about as diverse as a Soviet politburo during the empire's final, geriatric years. Yes, some were bald, others had bushy eyebrows. Some came from Leningrad, others from Minsk. Some were septuagenarians, others were octogenarians º There are two Catholic bishops from the church's left-fringe. Three liberal rabbis. And several Black denominational leaders who shun the social conservatism typical of most black churches" (Neuhaus, 1997).

Of course, he is belittling some of the most eminent religious leaders in America who serve on the Interfaith Alliance Board, including Rabbi David Gelfand, Senior Rabbi at The Jewish Center of the Hamptons in East Hampton, New York; Rev. Gardner C. Taylor, Pastor Emeritus of the Concord Baptist Church of Christ in Brooklyn, and past president of the Progressive National Baptist Convention; and Dr. J. Philip Wogaman, former Dean of Wesley Seminary in Washington, D.C. and retired Senior Minister of Foundry UMC in the nation's capitol (The Interfaith Alliance, 2003).

Mr. Tooley is not alone, however. Diane Knippers, formerly a United Methodist, is now a member of the Truro Episcopal Church in Fairfax, Virginia (along with Colonel Oliver North) and heads up the IRD. Ms. Knippers recently made the claim in The United Methodist Reporter that "The fact is that the IRD rarely takes any kind of political position" (Smith, 2002). Nothing could be further from the truth. It would be difficult to find a right-wing Republican position that IRD has not rallied behind with gusto. We documented several dozen examples. Following are only a few.

The IRD has pressed the Bush administration to take a harder line on North Korea (Goodenough, 2003) and vigorously supported Republican tax cuts for the rich (Tooley, 2001b, c). Mr. Tooley's direct board of directors supervisor, David Stanley, is the chairman of a radical anti-tax group (Clark, 1999) that advocates the slashing of government services for the poor and disabled and huge tax cuts for the wealthy (Neas, 2003). The IRD opposes even limited environmental protection efforts and has collaborated with other like-minded folks to try to roll back protections now in place (Interfaith Coalition for Environmental Stewardship, 2003; Public Eye, 2003; Sider &amp; Ball, 2002; Tooley, 2002). The IRD, particularly Ms. Knippers, has been vocal in opposition to any form of hate crime legislation (Jones, 2000). It has expressed opposition to a land mines treaty (Institute on Religion and Democracy, 2001b) and to women even having knowledge about reproductive choices (Institute on Religion and Democracy, 2001c).

The Political Conversion of New York's Evangelicals
By ANDREA ELLIOTT

The signs are all around. Storefront churches dot the commercial landscapes of the Bronx and Queens. Twice as many churchgoers - about 15,000 - pray weekly at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn, compared with five years ago. Some 200,000 New Yorkers tune in daily to Radio Vision Cristiana, an AM radio station. And last March, thousands of evangelicals gathered on the steps of the State Supreme Court in the Bronx to protest the idea of same-sex marriage.

Evangelism is flourishing not just in the red states of the nation's heartland, but in the urban, liberal stronghold of New York City, where thousands of evangelical churches are anchored in working-class neighborhoods. Whether it will evolve into a local political force, as it has nationally, remains an open question. But a range of interviews with pastors, congregants and religious experts suggests that a new debate - and perhaps a political conversion - is taking place in parts of the city's minority neighborhoods, swaths that Democrats have long claimed as their own.

It is a conversion that prompted Jeanmarie Salazar, a Puerto Rican mother of four in the Bronx, to vote for President Bush even though his economic policies troubled her. And a conversion that caused Harold Thompson, an African-American from Flatbush who lived through the civil rights movement, to part with a lifetime of voting Democratic, citing the "immorality that is destroying our country."

Both Ms. Salazar and Mr. Thompson belong to evangelical churches whose leaders have spread a single but potent message: Faith trumps everything else, even traditional party alignments.

"They're beginning to think about the social transformation of New York City," said Tony Carnes, a sociologist of religion at Columbia University.

Precisely determining the number of people who consider themselves members of evangelical churches or movements is difficult. Mr. Carnes said that he conducted a census of the city's evangelical churches and estimated that 1.5 million New Yorkers attend them. A separate study, conducted in 2000 by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, put the number of evangelical New Yorkers closer to 1 million, said Vivian Klaff, a professor of sociology at the University of Delaware who analyzed the study's data.

If a fully accurate count of evangelicals in the city is difficult to achieve, it is even harder, at the moment, to define the voting patterns of evangelicals. But the number of Protestant New Yorkers who cast ballots for a Republican president more than doubled in the last four years, to nearly a quarter of those surveyed at polling sites by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International. And a recent study by Mr. Carnes suggested that a majority of evangelical church leaders in the city were breaking with tradition and voting Republican: of 1,006 ordained ministers surveyed last year, Mr. Carnes found, 55 percent said they planned to vote for Mr. Bush.

About 30 percent of the ministers were black and 30 percent Hispanic, reflecting the demographic breakdown of the religious group, Mr. Carnes said.

"It's a significant development," said Randall Barnes, a professor of American religious history at Barnard College. But, he added, the Republican Party in New York City is "still a decade or two away from making significant inroads into that community."

Any measuring of the political clout of evangelicals in the city, now or in the future, is complicated by the fact that a sizable portion of them are from other countries, and some are not eligible to vote, said Mr. Carnes, who conducted his study with a team of pollsters at the International Research Institute on Values Changes, an independent research group in New York City. The study was financed by the Christian Cultural Center, a charismatic evangelical church.

But the results indicated a shift to the right among voting evangelicals. In a separate study he did in 1997, Mr. Carnes said, only 22 percent of the city's evangelical church leaders surveyed identified themselves as "politically conservative."

In the aftermath of the election, an increasingly complex image has emerged of the Christian electorate - one that is not entirely captured under the religious right rubric. In New York City, there are the evangelicals who consider themselves liberal and voted for Kerry but find that they are missing from the mainstream image of their faith.

But then there are those, like Mr. Thompson, who broke with tradition for the first time to vote Republican.

And while many New Yorkers have loudly voiced their sense of alienation from the faith-based vote of the red states, the city's evangelicals, in numerous interviews, said they felt a similar invisibility in the Democratic stronghold they call home.

"You feel like you're alone," said Abraham Lopez, 19, as he stood on a recent Saturday outside the Assemblies of United Christian Churches on Third Avenue in the South Bronx.

Perhaps no single event better captures the group's presence than a same-sex marriage protest on March 14 in the South Bronx.

Led by State Senator Rub鮠Diaz, 150 Bronx churches closed for the day. They sent their congregants to the steps of the State Supreme Court on the Grand Concourse where thousands of people - estimated at 8,000 by Mr. Carnes, who used two methods to count the crowd - filled the streets. A large banner hung between two pillars, reading, "No to Homosexual Marriage."

"We said, 'Sunday nobody goes to church; we'll go to the street,' " said Mr. Diaz, one of the most noted of the city's Hispanic evangelicals. Mr. Diaz, whose South Bronx district includes about 250,000 people, is both an evangelical pastor and a registered Democrat.

"I am a conservative Democrat," Mr. Diaz, 61, said in a telephone interview from Puerto Rico. "When it comes to education, when it comes to health, when it comes to jobs, I'm a Democrat. When it comes to moral issues - marriage, abortion - I'm not a Democrat."

Mr. Diaz has a history of stirring controversy with his conservative stands on same-sex marriage and abortion. In 1994, after he organized a voter drive for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Diaz, then a city councilman, vocally criticized the Gay and Lesbian Olympic Games. Mr. Giuliani then issued a statement distancing himself from Mr. Diaz's views. In 2003, Mr. Diaz filed a lawsuit, which is still pending, against the city over the opening of a small public school for gay students. He defends his positions unflinchingly, saying things like he "cannot wait" for the reversal of Roe v. Wade and eagerly admitting that gay rights activists have picketed his church.

Several political strategists who have worked with Republicans and Democrats said that no one with Mr. Diaz's conservative views would be able to win a citywide or statewide office. But in local city politics, like races for the State Assembly and the City Council, the faith-driven agenda might have greater impact.

"In a Democratic primary where you take the party affiliation question out of play, then I think it could become a more powerful influence," said Kieran Mahoney, a Republican political strategist whose clients have included Gov. George E. Pataki.

Pedro Espada Jr., who lost to Mr. Diaz in the primary this year, said he had no doubt that the evangelical movement could sway local politics. Mr. Espada, who was ousted from his Senate seat by Mr. Diaz in 2002, tried to reach out to evangelical voters by visiting Bronx churches.

"They would say, 'Espada, we would vote for you but you are not a Christian,' " Mr. Espada said. But other politicians were more skeptical that the group's members would be driven by religion when they entered the voting booth.

Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president who is running for mayor, said, "Issues of faith and family matter, but so do issues of how we support our families, equal access and opportunity, housing, education, health care, jobs."

While Hispanics and African Americans in New York City have traditionally voted Democratic, those who attend evangelical churches may feel a different pull.

Jos頃asanova, a professor of sociology who specializes in religion and politics at New School University and has studied evangelicals around the world, said that even if they are poor, they tend to vote for conservative candidates.

"They do not so much identify with their economic position right now, but with the one they ought to have with the help of God," he said. "They are very conservative and pro-market and do not expect the government to help them."

It is not clear how pervasive this view has been in New York City's evangelical community. But the Rev. A. R. Bernard has made a point of preaching economic independence and social conservatism at the Christian Cultural Center, where more than 90 percent of congregants are African Americans or black immigrants.

"We are teaching them self-reliance," Mr. Bernard said. "We have a whole new generation of people of color who have grown up without legal and racial barriers. They have experienced unprecedented wealth, unprecedented education, a position in the marketplace. So once you have something to conserve, you become more conservative."

Mr. Bernard, who said he voted for President Bush, does not publicly endorse candidates. However, he did tell his congregants that they should question the tendency to vote along traditional party lines.

Two of his church's members, Raina and Robert Bundy, said they decided to vote for Mr. Bush by following the news, watching the debates and, ultimately, praying over their choice. Like many African Americans, they said they were brought up to vote Democratic, but now compared the tradition to their mothers' old recipes for collard greens.

"We don't use fatback, it's all about olive oil now," Mrs. Bundy said. "You don't keep cooking something even though you know it's not good for you."

ID as a movement

The Intelligent Design movement is an organized campaign to promote ID arguments in the public sphere, primarily in the United States. The hub of the movement is the Center for Science and Culture, a subsidiary of the Discovery Institute, a politically conservative think tank. According to Reason magazine, promotional materials from the Seattle-based Discovery Institute acknowledge that the Ahmanson family donated $1.5 million to the Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture for a research and publicity program to "unseat not just Darwinism but also Darwinism's cultural legacy".

Mr. Ahmanson funds many causes important to the Christian religious right, including Christian Reconstructionism, whose goal is to place the U.S. "under the control of biblical law" (sources: Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195157427/qid=1095946867/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/002-1200768-5974420), Oxford University Press, 2004, and "Avenging angel of the religious right (http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/01/06/ahmanson/)" in Salon Magazine).

Though outwardly secular in its arguments, the ID movement is religiously motivated by conservative Christians who wish to replace the current materialistic understanding of the universe and its origins with a Christian explanation:

"Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."
(source The Discovery Institute: The "Wedge Document": "So What?" (http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;program=CSC%20Responses&amp;id=2101)).

Wow, Mr. Ahmanson's name keeps popping up. Interesting. It's also notable that Ahmanson is a founding member of the Council on National Policy, which is a highly secretive organization. Even though some information about it can be found on the internet, we actually know very little about the mandate of the organization or what goes on in it's regular meetings. It was organized in the early 1970s and it's by-laws state that the membership list is to be secret as are it's meeting's agendas and minutes. We have only three lists of membership of the CNP because reporters have managed to penetrate their rigorous and highly selective membership requirements only three times.

Discovery Institute's "Wedge Project" Circulates Online

by James Still

A recently-circulated position paper of The Center for the Renewal of Science &amp; Culture (CRSC) reveals an ambitious plan to replace the current naturalistic methodology of science with a theistic alternative called "intelligent design."

The CRSC, a program launched by the Discovery Institute in 1996, is the major force behind recent advances in the intelligent design movement. The Center is directed by Discovery Senior Fellow Dr. Stephen Meyer, Associate Professor of Philosophy at Whitworth College. Its mission is "to replace materialism and its destructive cultural legacies with a positive scientific alternative." The Discovery Institute hopes that intelligent design will be the usurper that finally dethrones the theory of evolution.

On March 3, 1999, an anonymous person obtained an internal white paper from the CRSC entitled "The Wedge Project," which detailed the Center's ambitious long-term strategy to replace "materialistic science" with intelligent design. The paper describes the CRSC's mission with a sense of urgency:

"The social consequences of materialism have been devastating. As symptoms, those consequences are certainly worth treating. However, we are convinced that in order to defeat materialism, we must cut it off at its source. That source is scientific materialism. This is precisely our strategy. If we view the predominant materialistic science as a giant tree, our strategy is intended to function as a "wedge" that, while relatively small, can split the trunk when applied at its weakest points. The very beginning of this strategy, the "thin edge of the wedge," was Phillip Johnson's critique of Darwinism begun in 1991 in Darwinism on Trial, and continued in Reason in the Balance and Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds. Michael Behe's highly successful Darwin's Black Box followed Johnson's work. We are building on this momentum, broadening the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of intelligent design (ID). Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions."

The paper outlines a "wedge strategy" that has three phases. Phase I, "Scientific Research, Writing, and Publicity" involves the Paleontology Research Program (led by Dr. Paul Chien), the Molecular Biology Research Program (led by Dr. Douglas Axe), and any individual researcher who is given a fellowship by the Institute. Phase I has already begun, the paper argues, with the watershed work of Phillip Johnson, whose Darwinism on Trial sparked the intelligent design movement. The Center hopes that more Christian scientists will step forward and engage in research that would support the intelligent design theory.

Phase II, "Publicity and Opinion-Making" involves communicating the research of Phase I. The Center plans to do this through book tours, opinion-making conferences, apologetics seminars, a teacher training program, use of opinion-editorials in newspapers, television program productions (either with Public Broadcasting or another broadcaster), and the printing of publications to distribute. Phases I and II are to be implemented over the next five years (1999-2003). Phase II is

"to prepare the popular reception of our ideas. The best and truest research can languish unread and unused unless it is properly publicized. For this reason we seek to cultivate and convince influential individuals in print and broadcast media, as well as think tank leaders, scientists and academics, congressional staff, talk show hosts, college and seminary presidents and faculty, future talent and potential academic allies. Because of his long tenure in politics, journalism and public policy, Discovery President Bruce Chapman brings to the project rare knowledge and acquaintance of key op-ed writers, journalists, and political leaders. This combination of scientific and scholarly expertise and media and political connections makes the Wedge unique, and also prevents it from being 'merely academic.' Other activities include production of a PBS documentary on intelligent design and its implications, and popular op-ed publishing. Alongside a focus on influential opinion-makers, we also seek to build up a popular base of support among our natural constituency, namely, Christians. We will do this primarily through apologetics seminars. We intend these to encourage and equip believers with new scientific evidence's that support the faith, as well as to "popularize" our ideas in the broader culture."

Phase III, "Cultural Confrontation and Renewal" begins sometime in 2003 and may take as long as twenty years to complete. It involves three things: (1) "Academic and Scientific Challenge Conferences"; (2) "Potential Legal Action for Teacher Training"; and (3) "Research Fellowship Program: shift to social sciences and humanities". The white paper describes Phase III as the renewal phase because it seeks to fill the void left behind by materialistic evolution (attacked in Phase II) with its own intelligent design model:

"Once our research and writing have had time to mature, and the public prepared for the reception of design theory, we will move toward direct confrontation with the advocates of materialist science through challenge conferences in significant academic settings. We will also pursue possible legal assistance in response to resistance to the integration of design theory into public school science curricula. The attention, publicity, and influence of design theory should draw scientific materialists into open debate with design theorists, and we will be ready. With an added emphasis to the social sciences and humanities, we will begin to address the specific social consequences of materialism and the Darwinist theory that supports it in the sciences."

The Wedge Project white paper ends with a detailed summary of progress-to-date, including goals for the future.

The reintroduction of theism into public discourse in Phase III is set to begin sometime in 2003. But before Phase III can begin, Phase II must have already dethroned naturalism through a vigorous public relations and opinion-shaping campaign. This puts the cart before the horse. When will there be time to conduct careful research? Science is supposed to be a vehicle that provides the reason to believe that intelligent design is a better explanation than naturalism. To think that a scientist must reach his or her conclusions within a five-year span of time, running concurrent with a public relations campaign, is hardly good scientific practice. Not only will it put unnecessary pressure on the scientist to reach conclusions before the data warrants it, but it ignores the very nature of the scientific enterprise. Often it takes years before the findings in science are fully understood and many more before the results are applied to real-world problems.
</quote>

<quote>
Another problem with the CRSC's plan is that it seeks to replace evolutionary theory at a time when the theory enjoys nearly unanimous support in the scientific community. Thomas Kuhn, in his The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, describes what has happened historically when one theory comes to replace another. He writes that the anomaly of an insufficient theory will have "lasted so long and penetrated so deep that one can appropriately describe the fields affected by it as in a state of growing crisis... the emergence of new theories is generally preceded by a period of pronounced professional insecurity." Kuhn's point is clear. Before a new theory in science is sought, there is usually a growing crisis coupled with mounting skepticism, doubt, and the elucidation of cogent reasons for thinking that the existing theory is inadequate. Where is the growing crisis that casts doubt on evolution and methodological naturalism, the tool that led to the theory of evolution? Aside from a few participants in well-publicized Templeton-funded conferences, scientists experience no insecurity with their current methods. Even if the theory of evolution were inadequate, why should we expect the scientific community to turn to theistic explanations?

I am absolutely fascinated by your obsession toward proving that the religious right is on the verge of taking over the US gov't and then the world.
You're obviously very well educated, and highly intelligent.......let me guess........you're a psychologist or a psychiatrist. If that is the case, you should know how dangerous it is for the mind to be constantly obsessed with conspiracy theories. Let me suggest that you might be the last to know that you need psychiatric help. :wink:

Seriously though.......you provide too many "cut and paste" references for any but the most fanatic secular advocate.......it would be much more interesting if you would use more "Lolaisms" and less cut and paste. Have a wonderful day.

Real funny....Dawkins' last paragraph

The creationists' fondness for "gaps" in the fossil record is a metaphor for their love of gaps in knowledge generally. Gaps, by default, are filled by God. You don't know how the nerve impulse works? Good! You don't understand how memories are laid down in the brain? Excellent! Is photosynthesis a bafflingly complex process? Wonderful! Please don't go to work on the problem, just give up, and appeal to God. Dear scientist, don't work on your mysteries. Bring us your mysteries for we can use them. Don't squander precious ignorance by researching it away. Ignorance is God's gift to Kansas.

Ray. In the short time you've posted here I've never seen you disagree with a poster without vilification and personal slurs. Alluding to Lola's need for psychiatric care is so...so boorish. What is it? Were you bullied in the second grade schoolyard? Are you one of those short men maniacs?
I'd be appreciative of less "Raybanisms" and more cut and paste...capiche?

After reflection I am forced to agree about the general tone of my responses but in this case it caused you to arrive at the wrong conclusion about my intent. The comment about psychiatric help was an attempt at humour which badly misfired from your reaction. I have nothing but the highest regard for Lola and her keen mind but I stick to my suspicion that she is obsessed with the effects of the religious right on society and I hope she will forgive me for this comment to you but since I have already made it to her she may overlook it.

I promise to clean up my act but you must admit there is a great deal of intimidation and venomous partisanship on this forum which of course is no excuse for my behavior.

rayban.........your use of the word "obsession" referring to my interest in educating myself and others about the well financed fundamentalist/neo-conservative power grabbing is an excellent example of their techniques.

1. vilify and ridicule those who don't agree with you. Use adjectives with negative connotations in addressing them or speaking of them.

2. Repeat the use of these adjectives often whenever referring to your opponents. Because the more often you say it, the truer it is.

Thank you for this fine example.

I'm sorry if you don't read fast enough or are too uninterested in knowing about the methods and intentions of the fanatics to follow what I've posted here. I'm posting it for those who are interested enough and want to be informed. I'm also collecting information as I find it here for later reference.

Some people claim that all of this is no secret because it's so available on the internet. But you are right about one thing and that is that it may as well be secret because it takes a lot of work to find it and read it and then begin to make the eventually obvious connections.

So if you like your head in the sand, continue as you have been. But just remember that when your head's in the sand, your fanny is exposed. And sooner or later, you'll get what you deserve. Enjoy.

Science or Myth?
A Documentation History of Events
The Burlington-Edison Committee for Science Education

Defeating the Discovery Institute

On May 8, 1998 we heard that Roger DeHart, a science teacher employed in our high school, was teaching creationism. We later discovered that he was a fundamentalist and was working in concert with fundamentalist foundations worth millions of dollars who make it their business to generate questionable evidence and fund local anti-science initiatives.

Specifically, DeHart is supported by The Discovery Institute and the Rutherford Institute, two very active organizations who decry the separation of church and state.

We first received news of Roger DeHart and his work with the Discovery Institute (DI) when one of our members attended a class on creationism sponsored at a local church. Mr. DeHart spoke at one of the classes. Knowing that DeHart was employed by our high school, we were immediately concerned that DeHart may have been lecturing in his classes that which he was lecturing that morning.

At that time, most of us in the BECSE, (Burlington-Edison Committee for Science Education), had never heard of the Discovery Institute. As time went by - and soon will be clear - the DI was providing DeHart with his materials, and educating him on how to subvert science in subtle ways that appeared to be legitimate biology.

Instead of combating DeHart alone, it became clear that our task was to defeat the DI. Over the past 3 years, our knowledge of evolution and creationism has grown. It is now clear to us that our best efforts to combat local creationism will be to assist others to fight local creationism as well. In short, BECSE seeks to combat national creationism. Our goal with this website is to reach out to other communities who are facing anti-science pressure and assist them in their efforts to defend quality science.

The DI has many members, most of whom hold advanced degrees in fields from law and literature to science and mathematics. The one thing they seem to have in common is the desire to move our world back into the dark ages where scientific observations were allowed to be explained by supernatural miracles. A document entitled The Wedge, was published. It lays out a twenty year plan for achieving their goals, which is to have religion control not only science, but also everyday life, laws, and education.

We are a small town community in a rural county. The members of the BECSE come from many walks of life and many spiritual points of view. To be confronted with the DI - and their reconstructionist agenda - was frightening. The DI has a budget of millions of dollars. They have a lot of education and titles that impress people which they use for political clout. But, in order for them to win, their teacher here in Burlington must be allowed to teach their materials. At this point in time, Mr. DeHart is not allowed to teach creationism or Intelligent Design in any form. The DI is being defeated in our town, and they can be defeated in yours as well.
The National Center for Science Education (NCSE) and the ACLU have been invaluable to us. Contact your local ACLU, the NCSE and us. (Here is the ACLU press release on our fight.)

Don't be afraid of the big bad Discovery Institute. They can be defeated.

The Rutherford Institute - John W. Whitehead
John W. Whitehead, head of the Rutherford Institute, has gone to great lengths to conceal the ideological leanings of his Christian Right legal center in statements to the mass media. He told the New York Times that "Oh, gosh, no," he had no political agenda in representing Paula Jones, and that he had founded the Rutherford Institute by himself. The New York Times reporter described The Rutherford Institute as "a kind of evangelical Christian civil liberties union."118

Whitehead's claims misrepresent the group. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, is blunt, "Our files on the Institute go back 10 years. After examining the material, we can safely say Whitehead is not being honest in his description of his organization."119

From its founding, the Rutherford Institute has pursued a highly-politicized ultra-conservative agenda. A review of Rutherford Institute newsletters, reports, and direct mail appeals going back seven years shows a long pattern of attacks on liberals in government and President Clinton in particular. Whitehead consistently puts forward an apocalyptic conspiracist vision of devout Christian activists under concerted attack by corrupt and repressive government officials in the service of godless and immoral secular humanism.

In the late 1990s Whitehead claimed he had changed his earlier views, giving a detailed interview on the subject to Christianity Today in December of 1998.120 Yet Whitehead's shift is more tactical rather than a shift in basic ideology, and reflects the trend in the Christian Right toward re-applying the principle of "hating the sin, but loving the sinner," even when the goal is still theocratic and monocultural.121

From time to time Rutherford's periodical carries broad-based articles to buttress the organization's claim that it is just like an American Civil Liberties Union for people of faith. In the September 1996 issue, which carries a cover story on "Politics &amp; Religion: A Recipe for Disaster," there are interviews with centrist political commentators such as E. J. Dionne, Jr. and Larry Sabato-as well as a column by Barry W. Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

Paul Weyrich, president of the Free Congress Foundation, rounds out the issue of Rutherford magazine with a litany of all the reasons he hates government under Clinton and his liberal allies. Claiming that "Liberals have dominated politics in this country for more than sixty years," Weyrich paints a paranoid picture of life in the US where "God-fearing, law-abiding, taxpaying citizens" live under a statist globalist tyranny. He then concludes that a nation with a government that is in opposition to his hard right view of Constitutional and godly laws, "will deserve the hatred of God and its people."122

In Facing the Wrath: Confronting the Right in Dangerous Times, sociologist Sara Diamond describes the political activism of the Rutherford Institute:

"Active since 1982, the Rutherford Institute represents a variety of Christian `civil liberties' litigants, anti-abortion demonstrators, students asked not to read Bibles at public schools, parents whose home school facilities fail to meet government regulations. No doubt, Christians deserve as much legal protection as anyone else. But with much of the ACLJ and Rutherford case load, there's a fine line between defending the interests of clients and stepping on the rights of other people.

In a...commentary sent to Christian radio stations, Rutherford Institute president John Whitehead argues that workplace seminars on gay rights are a form of `religious discrimination' against employees who are `told to rid themselves of stereotypes about gays and to accept homosexuality as a valid lifestyle choice.'

In an odd assertion of victim status, Whitehead claims Christian military personnel may jeopardize their careers if they `speak out against homosexuality....The immediate remedy is for the military to exempt religious people from compelled personal acceptance of homosexuality.'123

The politics of the Rutherford Institute, at least until recently, represented a form of theocratic Christianity that characterizes the hard right of the evangelical world. There is little reason to believe that a change in tone means a change in the underlying philosophy.

<quote>
The Rutherford Institute, a "resource center," was formed in 1982 by attorney John W. Whitehead to provide legal aid to right-wing causes. It has ties to the radical fringes of Christian fundamentalism, He named the institute after Samuel Rutherford, a 17th century Scottish theologian who argued, in a 1644 pamphlet cleverly titled Lex, Rex, that kings must be subordinate to the law, because the rule of kings is derived from men, whereas the rule of law is derived from God. Rutherford's arguments about the authority of kings were quite influential in the development of the concept of the "social contract" by later philosophers such as Locke and Rousseau.
Early members of the Rutherford Foundation's board of directors included California millionaire Howard F. Ahmanson, Jr., as well as prominent fundamentalist activists such as Francis Schaeffer and R.J. Rushdoony of The Chalcedon Foundation, a West Coast Christian think tank in which the Christian Reconstructionist Movement was born forty years ago. The early activities of the Rutherford Institute reflected this, and tended to focus on cases involving public primary and secondary education. They were especially active and often successful in trying to stop condom distribution in public schools, as well as sex education, AIDS prevention programs, and programs that teach tolerance.

Within a few years, Whitehead had begun to move away from the Christian Reconstructionist Movement, disassociating himself from some organizations, such as the Coalition on Revival, and broadening the scope of the Rutherford Foundation's interests.

The Rutherford Foundation became widely known to the public at large with the Paula Jones lawsuit agaist Bill Clinton, which the foundation backed, with Whitehead acting as co-counsel. In recent years, however, the Rutherford Foundation has continued to move towards being a mainstream constitutional legal advocacy organization, often seeming to disagree with the likes of the ACLU on little more than the precise boundaries of the Establishment Clause. In addition to their aforementioned brief in the José Padilla case, they have taken a strong stand in opposition to the Patriot Act, argued that Yaser Hamdi deserved due process, opposed student drug testing, and represented Lt. Col Martha McSally in her suit challenging the military policy which required servicewomen stationed in Saudi Arabia to wear the body-covering abaya when travelling in the country. Perhaps most surprisingly, to those who are primarily familiar with the early years of the Foundation, editorials on their web site were generally in favor of the Supreme Court's 2003 decision in Lawrence v. Texas.

Gee.....you certainly have taught me something. I'm certain Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and Richard Perle will be interested to find that you have them in the same bed. After reading some of this thread I was of the opinion you were more careful than that in your wording or did you really mean that?

I personally am quite committed to the theory of evolution but at the same time I'm uncomfortable with anyone thinking religion should be abolished along with the ten commandments. I think it reasonable to advance the premise that society must have an established code to live by and the ten commandments have served this nation quite well for more two centuries.
The code that says, "do anything that feels good", advanced by progressives causes me to worry greatly about my grand children and their happiness when they discover that their genetically generated psychological need to believe in something greater than themselves must be repressed. The vacuum created by the destruction of all religion must be filled with....... something. Ahh.....the light bulb just came on.......Socialism is just what is needed to fill the vacuum.

Personally I'll take the Neocons anytime over socialism....... I can see I won't last long on this thread but I can still tune in occassionally and admire your gorgeous gams. You have a little bit of a wicked streak to go along with that large intellect <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz"/>

BTW....speaking of head in sand.....I've often wondered about that same situation with those who oppose Bush's aggressive battle against Islamic Fascism.

<quote>
Defund the left is a term used in America to describe efforts by conservative activists to eliminate government financial support for non-profit groups deemed to be 'liberal'.

While initially coined in response to Reagan government proposals to curtail funding of non-profits, it has subsequently been more loosely used to describe a range of other administrative measures aimed at silencing advocacy groups.

Conservative concern grows
The rise of public interest groups campaigning on a broad range of issues in the 1960's antagonized conservative groups. While little could be done to restrict informal action groups, the larger non-profit groups relied on the benefits of their tax-exempt status to attract tax-deductible donations from individuals and foundations. In some cases, they also gained grants directly from government.

The funding of voter registration drives as part of the civil rights movement by some foundations in the 1960's so enraged conservatives that in 1969 they convened congressional hearings in an attempt to regulate the activities of non-profit groups and foundations. These hearings resulted in the 1969 Tax Reform Act, which created the architecture of the current regulatory framework. In 1976 the legislation was further refined to allow non-profit groups with 501 c 3 tax-deductible status to engage in some lobbying as long as it didn't exceed 20 percent of an organization's budget.

Through the 1970s traditional foundations, supplemented by new foundations, broadened the scope of what they were willing to fund to include more 'liberal' projects.

[edit]The Reagan administration moves to muzzle non-profits
In 1981, the Heritage Foundation, the dominant conservative think-tank at the time, published Mandate for Leadership, a comprehensive conservative agenda with over two thousand policy recommendations for the incoming Reagan administration.

One challenge, as Heritage saw it, was to counter the rise of its ideological opponents by whittling away their status as 'public interest' organisations and eliminating federal financial support for 'liberal' groups. "Unless conservatives can break the moral monopoly still enjoyed by persons indifferent to the well-being of the American private sector and by proponents of expanded government power, any effort to reform federal domestic policies is likely to be reduced to the level of tinkering," they wrote.

According to OMB Watch, a non-profit group that has tracked attempts to constrain non-profit groups, the Heritage Foundation's 1981 proposals comprised three key changes. (OMB is the acronym for the Office of Management and Budget). Firstly they wanted to "impose some sort of lobbying and advocacy restrictions on any organization receiving federal funds", even if any lobbying was funded by funds raised independently by the organisation itself. Secondly was to "specify the type of such 'informational' activity that can be done with federal grants". Thirdly Heritage sought to "limit the circumstances under which grants and contracts can go to groups organized primarily for lobbying and advocacy." [1] (http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/1424/1/169/)

The Heritage Foundation's proposal was quickly translated into a proposed Presidential Executive Order, named A-122 Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations, by the Office of Management and Budget general counsel, Michael Horowitz. The draft order defined the freshly minted term "political advocacy" as comprising any action "attempting to influence a government decision." Any organization engaging in political advocacy would not be eligible for federal grants irrespective of whether the advocacy was paid for by other sources of fundraising revenue or federal funds.

The proposals prompted a massive backlash with a three year campaign, led by the National A-122 Coalition comprising non-profit, religious, and other charitable organizations, defeating the proposals. Horowitz recounted over a decade later being rebuked by Reagan's Chief of Staff James A. Baker III. "The leader of the free world has come to me and said that all he has been hearing is this business about A-122," he said. (After working for the Reagan administration Horowitz went on to become a senior fellow at the Washington office of the conservative think tank, the Hudson Institute).

While the A-122 proposals were defeated, they still had the effect of chilling both non-profits and some foundations. Nor had the conservative movement given up on the notion of 'defunding the left'.

In 1984, the Capital Research Center (CRC) was founded by former Heritage Foundation senior Vice-President and Reagan administration staffer Willa Johnson. CRC was established with seed funding from Richard Mellon Scaife, Adolph Coors and John Olin foundations. The role of CRC was to erode the standing of those it viewed as 'liberal' non-profit advocacy groups and foundations.

[edit]Non-profits and the Gingrich revolution
The rise of the anti-environmental Wise Use Movement also adopted the calls to 'defund the left'. 'Wise Use' leaders such as Ron Arnold - who more recently has been a regular contributor to CRC publications - routinely made eliminating financial support for environmental groups one of his key messages. "We want to destroy the environmentalists by taking away their money and their members" Arnold told the New York Times.

The tobacco industry too spotted the attraction in constraining the advocacy of public interest health groups. An internal Philip Morris strategy document prepared in late 1993 proposed to run a campaign in California to "regulate" charitable health organisations by capping advocacy spending and diverting funding into research activities. "Reporting requirements for percent of funds used for research vs salaries: cap administrative costs, salaries, lobbying expenditures; establish minimum percentage of funds for research," the strategy stated. [2] (http://tobaccodocuments.org/landman/34296.html)

With the success of the Republicans winning control of the House of Representatives in 1994, the targeting of non-profit groups was once more elevated on the political agenda. The Republicans success was captured in Newt Gingrich's Contract with America which aimed to slasf federal funding on a range of 'liberal' programs.

Conservative activists though needed to tread carefully because what they wanted was to strip federal funding from 'liberal' organisations without affecting corporate lobbying or funding for conservative groups. By targeting only federal grants but excluding contracts, corporate contractors - such as the defense industry - would remain free to lobby and most conservative groups would be unaffected.

In 1995, the environmental watchdog CLEAR "obtained documentation that details evidence of a right-wing legislative effort to 'defund the left' being coordinated by an alliance of conservative advocacy groups and Members of Congress. Their target: federal funding of non-profit advocacy organizations." [3] (http://www.clearproject.org/reports_defund.html)

Amongst those supporting the campaign were the Christian Coalition, Grover Norquist's Americans For Tax Reform, the Competitive Enterprise Institute the Institute for Justice, the Eagle Forum and the American Conservative Union.

The documents revealed that a bill - Stop Taxpayer Funded Political Advocacy - would be introduced by Oklahoma Republican Representative, Ernest Istook, that would have prohibited any 501 (c) 4 and 501 (c) 5 organizations from receiving any federal funds.

In American Prospect, Karen Paget reported that it would have given private citizens legal standing to challenge the activity of any non-profit in court, with the burden of proof falling on the NGO to clear its name and would have prohibited any organisation that received federal funds from engaging in any "advocacy" activity. [4] (http://www.prospect.org/print/V10/44/paget-k.html)

CLEAR described the strategy as being aimed as being for a quick, clean hit. "The strategists behind this bill hope it will be dropped in about two weeks and go straight to the floor with no committee hearings. They are also very concerned that they 'spin' this campaign to make it look like a 'good government' campaign rather than a 'defund our enemies list' effort."

In early 1995, Jeff Shear wrote in the National Journal and subsequently the Baltimore Sun of a Republican project - later to be dubbed the K Street project - being co-ordinated out of the office of House Majority Leader Dick Armey. Heading the project was Virginia Thomas (wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas), which also involved Scott Hodges the Heritage Foundation's budget director. One of those involved in the project, conservative activists Grover Norquist, told Shear "we will hunt liberal groups down one by one and extinguish their funding sources".

"With control over Congress and the White House, it's all over. We will go back and sue people who broke the law, who were ripping off taxpayers to do political work. If Planned Parenthood is lobbying, taxpayers need to be reimbursed," he said.

Kate O'Beirne, the Heritage Foundation's vice president for government relations, told Shear that "publicly funded political advocates rarely find themselves debating anyone who's privately funded  They are all supported by tax dollars. If their ideas are so compelling, let them go out in the marketplace, as Heritage does, and see if the public agrees with them."

The momentum was gathering on other fronts too. In 1996 the CRC launched its new monthly newsletter, Foundation Watch, to target the philanthropic activities of foundations it considered were funding groups too liberal for their tastes.

The Istook bill too provoked an uproar. Once more a coalition of non-profit groups, Let America Speak - co-chaired by the Alliance for Justice, Independent Sector, and OMB Watch - was created to counter the proposals. The Istook amendments were eventually defeated in 1997. However, according to OMB Watch, around the same time "the Senate worked out an agreement to restrict eligibility of 501(c)(4) (social welfare) organizations that lobby from receiving federal grants."

[edit]'Truth in Testimony'
After the two major full frontal attacks by conservative groups to constrain non-profit groups were rebuffed, the focus switched to procedural changes. In 1997 the House of Representatives passed a rule called "Truth in Testimony" that required all non-governmental groups testifying to disclose how much money in grants and contracts they have received from the government during the previous three years. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the rule as a "naked attempt to intimidate mainly nonprofit, liberal advocacy groups from testifying".

A spokesman for the Free Congress Foundation, Bradley Keena, welcomed the rule as "a first step toward levelling the playing field" and "part of a much larger plan to defund the left." Heritage foundation director of Congressional affairs, Marshall Whitmann, described the rule as an opportunity to highlight federal funding of non-profit groups. "For 40 years, we saw the growth of a spending complex that involved nonprofit organizations and governmental organizations that worked in tandem to grow Government. This rule is an opportunity to shed some light on this phenomenon and educate the taxpayer," he told the New Work Times.

[edit]More recent skirmishes
In February 2001, the annual Conservative Political Action Conference featured a "Defunding the left" panel of speakers with Terrence Scanlon from the Capital Research Center, Stefan Gleason from the National Right to Work Foundation, Paul Beckner from the Citizens for a Sound Economy and Morton Blackwell from the The Leadership Institute. [5] (http://www.cpac.org/CPACschedule2001.htm)

Conservative News Service reported that Scanlon complained of 'liberal' groups opposing the nomination of John Ashcroft to Attorney General and told the conference that left-wing non-profits could be stopped.

"For the first time since 1952, we have a Republican Congress, House and Senate, we have a Republican President, so the agency heads will be hopefully mostly conservatives. So for the very first time we have an opportunity to go after these groups and take away their federal money. Let's do it," Scanlon said. [6] (http://www.geocities.com/collective_int/archive3224_3352.htm)

In March 2003, a bill from Republican Representative, Michael Castle, to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, revived elements of both the Istook amendments and the Reagan era A-122 proposals. Once more a storm of protest erupted. The following month the proposed restrictions were dropped.

However, OMB Watch notes that with omnibus proposals repeatedly defeated, the conservative emphasis has switched to piecemeal changes that add up over time.

In July 2003 OMB Watch, released a report, An Attack on Nonprofit Speech: Death By a Thousand Cuts - chronicling a myriad of minor attacks on the ability of NGO groups to speak out. The report authors noted that "when there were attacks on non-profit advocacy in 1983 and 1995, the sector organized galvanizing responses to fend them off. Unfortunately, it appears that such attacks are again surfacing, but in ways that are broader yet much harder to fight back." [7] (http://www.ombwatch.org/filemanager/download/42/ANSjul03.pdf/)

[edit]Using 'eco-terrorism' smears to mask funding attacks
The environmental movement in particular has been singled out for attention by think tanks and PR companies to be marginalised by being portrayed as 'ecoterrorists'. In 2002, the Competitive Enterprise Institute co-sponsored a conference with the aggressive anti-green PR company Nichols-Dezenhall. (The company has since been renamed Dezenhall Resources after Nick Nichols, who spoke at the conference, retired). The conference was titled "Stopping Eco-Extremism: A Conference On Legislative, Legal And Communications Strategies To Protect Free Enterprise". [8] (http://www.prwatch.org/documents/clear_release.html) When CLEAR, the watchdog organisation on the anti-environmental movement, tried to gain access to the conference it was denied.

The week before the conference an article had appeared on TechCentralStation, written by Nick Nichols. Nichols argued 'eco-terrorism' was being funded by legitimate non-profit groups. "Like many foreign-based terrorist groups, many eco- and animal rights terrorist groups receive encouragement, support and funding from groups that are perceived to be legitimate charities. In the United States, charitable organizations classified as 501 (c)(3) groups under the tax code benefit from taxpayer subsidies, government grants and foundation philanthropy. This classification can bring enormous financial benefit to extremist groups," he wrote. [10] (http://www.techcentralstation.com/022802C.html)

According to a report of the meeting by David Case, the executive editor of TomPaine.com:."Nichols painted with the broadest of brushes, deftly segueing among references to September 11th, eco-terrorists and the mainstream environmental movement. One minute, he (rightly) condemns the $43 million-plus in property damage caused by ELF since 1996. Next, he reproaches the green crisis, a powerful "$22 billion per year" global conspiracy."

The firm's strategy, said the article "depends on routine, if hard-hitting, PR warfare: attacking a group's tax exempt status, its credibility and its funders. To eco-terrorists, these tactics are irrelevant. To media-dependent mainstream groups that that have rent and salaries to pay, they could be lethal". [11] (http://www.tompaine.com/feature.cfm/ID/5246)

While the term 'defund the left' is American, the strategy of seeking to curtail the voice of non-profit groups has spread beyond, largely through the fusion of aggrieved corporations working with conservative think tanks.

<quote>
A Think Tank is an organization that claims to serve as a center for research and/or analysis of important public issues. In reality, many think tanks are little more than public relations fronts, usually headquartered in state or national seats of government and generating self-serving scholarship that serves the advocacy goals of their industry sponsors; in the words of Yellow Times.org (http://www.yellowtimes.org/) columnist John Chuckman, "phony institutes where ideologue~propagandists pose as academics... [into which] money gushes like blood from opened arteries to support meaningless advertising's suffocation of genuine debate". [1] (http://www.yellowtimes.org/article.php?sid=1442&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0)

Of course, some think tanks are more legitimate than that. Private funding does not necessarily make a researcher a shill, and some think-tanks produce worthwhile public policy research. In general, however, research from think tanks is ideologically driven in accordance with the interests of its funders.

"We've got think tanks the way other towns have firehouses," Washington Post columnist Joel Achenbach says. "This is a thoughtful town. A friend of mine worked at a think tank temporarily and the director told him when he entered, 'We are white men between the ages of 50 and 55, and we have no place else to go.'"

"In 1970, Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell wrote a fateful memo to the National Chamber of Commerce saying that all of our best students are becoming anti-business because of the Vietnam War, and that we needed to do something about it. Powell's agenda included getting wealthy conservatives to set up professorships, setting up institutes on and off campus where intellectuals would write books from a conservative business perspective, and setting up think tanks. He outlined the whole thing in 1970. They set up the Heritage Foundation in 1973, and the Manhattan Institute after that. There are many others, including the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institute at Stanford, which date from the 1940s." --George Lakoff [2] (http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/10/27_lakoff.shtml)

Think tanks are funded primarily by large businesses and major foundations. They devise and promote policies that shape the lives of everyday Americans: Social Security privatization, tax and investment laws, regulation of everything from oil to the Internet. They supply experts to testify on Capitol Hill, write articles for the op-ed pages of newspapers, and appear as TV commentators. They advise presidential aspirants and lead orientation seminars to train incoming members of Congress.

Think tanks have a decided political leaning. There are twice as many conservative think tanks as liberal ones, and the conservative ones generally have more money. This is no accident, as one of the important functions of think tanks is to provide a backdoor way for wealthy business interests to promote their ideas or to support economic and sociological research not taking place elsewhere that they feel may turn out in their favor. Conservative think tanks also offer donors an opportunity to support conservative policies outside academia, which during the 1960s and 1970s was accused of having a strong "collectivist" bias.

"Modern think tanks are nonprofit, tax-exempt, political idea factories where donations can be as big as the donor's checkbook and are seldom publicized," notes Tom Brazaitis, writing for the Cleveland Plain Dealer. "Technology companies give to think tanks that promote open access to the internet. Wall Street firms donate to think tanks that espouse private investment of retirement funds." So much money now flows in, that the top 20 conservative think tanks now spend more money than all of the "soft money" contributions to the Republican party.

A think tank's resident experts carry titles such as "senior fellow" or "adjunct scholar," but this does not necessarily mean that they even possess an academic degree in their area of claimed expertise. Outside funding can corrupt the integrity of academic institutions. The same corrupting influences affect think tanks, only more so.

Think tanks are like universities minus the students and minus the systems of peer review and other mechanisms that academia uses to promote diversity of thought. Real academics are expected to conduct their research first and draw their conclusions second, but this process is often reversed at most policy-driven think tanks. As writer Jonathan Rowe has observed, the term "think" tanks is a misnomer. His comment was directed at the conservative Heritage Foundation, but it applies equally well to many other think tanks, regardless of ideology: "They don't think; they justify."

A Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) is a special category of think tank. As described by the National Science Foundation [3] (http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/nsf02321/secta.htm), FFRDCs are "R&amp;D-performing organizations that are exclusively or substantially financed by the Federal Government and are supported by the Federal Government either to meet a particular R&amp;D objective or, in some instances, to provide major facilities at universities for research and associated training purposes. Each center is administered either by an industrial firm, a university, or another nonprofit institution."

The Department of Defense (DOD) sponsors ten FFRDCs, which are listed below with other North American think tanks. Many of these DOD FFRDCs, and the institutions that operate them, have used their privileged status, and tax dollars, to venture beyond their charters. Such ventures have incurred the wrath of the Professional Services Council (PSC), an association of for-profit consulting firms, which has fought the aggrandizement of FFRDCs since the early 1970s. PSC's task force on FFRDCs "is charged with the challenging task of containing [FFRDCs] and similar quasi-governmental entities that benefit from sole-source contracting or otherwise are subsidized unfairly by the federal government..." [4] (http://www.pscouncil.org/committees/ffrdctf.asp). The efforts have paid off, to some extent, in tighter controls on the funding of FFRDCs and the types of research they are allowed to undertake.

The New Blacklist

By Doug Ireland, LA Weekly. Posted June 13, 2005.

The Christian right has launched a series of boycotts and pressure campaigns aimed at corporate America -- and at its sponsorship of entertainment, programs and activities they don't like.

Spurred on by a biblical injunction evangelicals call "The Great Commission," and emboldened by George W. Bush's re-election, which is perceived as a "mandate from God," the Christian right has launched a series of boycotts and pressure campaigns aimed at corporate America -- and at its sponsorship of entertainment, programs and activities they don't like.

And it's working. Just three weeks ago, the Rev. Donald Wildmon's American Family Association (AFA) announced it was ending its boycott of corporate giant Procter &amp; Gamble -- maker of household staples like Tide and Crest -- for being pro-gay. Why? Because the AFA's boycott (which the organization says enlisted 400,000 families) had succeeded in getting P&amp;G to pull its millions of dollars in advertising from TV shows like "Will &amp; Grace" and "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy."

P&amp;G also ended its advertising in gay magazines and on gay Web sites. And a P&amp;G executive who had been given a leave of absence to work on a successful Cincinnati, Ohio, referendum that repealed a ban on any measures protecting gays from discrimination was shown the door.

"We cannot say they are 100 percent clean, and we ask our supporters to let us know if they discover P&amp;G again being involved in pushing the homosexual lifestyle," growls the AFA's statement of victory over the corporate behemoth, "but judging by all that we found in our research, it appears that our concerns have been addressed." The Wall Street Journal reported on May 11 that "P&amp;G officials won't talk publicly about the boycott. But privately, they acknowledge the [Christer] groups turned out to be larger, better funded, better organized, and more sophisticated than the company had imagined."

<quote>
"The Christian right is incredibly mobilized," says Joan Bertin, executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship, a 30-year-old alliance of 50 nonprofit groups. Bertin says, "There's been an explosion of local book and arts censorship -- a lot of activity by an emboldened grassroots, who think they won the last election on moral grounds. They barely need to threaten a boycott to get those they target to back down -- hey, nobody had to threaten to boycott PBS to get them to back off Postcards From Buster." Bertin affirms that "This new threat from below as well as above has already achieved a widespread chill" on creative and entertainment arts throughout the country.

ok Thomas, back to the mega church question.

Osteen, T.D. Jakes, Bishop Blake and others are praise and worship ministers. Their congregations (which are huge and growing) come together to do just that, praise and worship. They are tired of coercive, guilt provoking techniques of the fire and brimstone type. Many of the mega church folks are non-denominational. This means they answer to no one and generally do their own thing. The hard religious right, those advocating theocracy, don't like these free thinkers. Osteen and many others refuse to have anything to do with politics. They believe, as I do that the church should stay out of politics and politics should stay out of the church. These ever growing congregations are not under the thumb of the control freaks and represent a real danger to their play for power. I'm hoping these will be the people we can depend on to break the back of the theocrats. And I believe that trend has already started.

The Wedge
A book published nearly a year ago is, I think, essential reading for anyone interested in the details of how a modern day cultural crusade gets successfully conducted. The book is Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design and its obstensible subject is, of course, the religious right's extensive efforts to get "Intelligent Design" (which I call IDiocy) a respected place in the public discourse. As important as this subject is by itself, what makes this book a must read is that it provides useful insight into how the right carefully picks an issue, defines its parameters, and then methodically constructs a public relations blitzkrieg in which no detail is too small, no angle missed, and no quarter taken.

The strategy used by the IDiots is nearly identical to that used by the right with other causes. What is unique, however, and what makes Creationism's Trojan Horse so valuable for anyone interested in confronting the right, is that it provides useful insight into how the right carefully picks an issue, defines its parameters, and then methodically constructs a public relations blitzkrieg in which no detail is too small, no angle missed, and no quarter taken.

Typically, the rightwing micro-stra nearly all the planning and implementation of the marketing of IDiocy was openly published tegizing is secret; the public only sees the final result, for example in the fine-tuned rhetoric of the anti-abortion movement, or the marketing of the Bush/Iraq war ("Well, would you rather have Saddam still in power?"). However, as the "Intelligent Design" effort was developed, the prime movers were either unable, or didn't bother, to cover their tracks. The meticulousness of the assault is simply astounding.

And let's not forget that the cause of the IDiots is intellectual, abstruse, abstract. The care and attention paid to the advocacy of an idea as opposed to a concrete action is impressive. As is the passion they've managed to generate over something as obscure as speciation development.

In summary, Creationism's Trojan Horse informs us that:

1. There is no science - none - behind the assertions of "Intelligent Design" advocates. Nor have the main proponents of IDiocy published any scientific research in support of their positions in any peer-reviewed journals.*

2. "Intelligent Design" advocates are simply "creationists in cheap tuxedos," who say one thing when they need to appear "scientific," and another when they are addressing religious groups.

3. The "Intelligent Design" movement is extremely well-funded by, among others, wealthy "christian reconstructionists" who are openly working for the establishment of an American theocratic state.

4. The hub of IDiocy is the CRSC, the self-styled " Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture" within the Discovery Institute, a right wing think tank at which, among others, Dick Cheney has spoken.

5. About 6 years ago, the CRSC created a document called The Wedge Strategy which outlined a comprehensive 5 year strategy to advance the cause of IDiocy. "Scientific," educational, legislative, legal, cultural, and marketing goals were laid out in detail.

6. To date, there is no well-funded, well-organized counter-strategy to confront IDiocy.

7. The efforts to advance the implement The Wedge Strategy and advance the cause of "Intelligent Design" have been phenomenally successful (except in actual science), far more than those who should be concerned about it realize.

The Wedge Strategy describes 3 phases -

Phase I. Scientific Research [sic], Writing &amp; Publicity

Phase II. Publicity &amp; Opinion-making

Phase III. Cultural Confrontation &amp; Renewal

But they only really care about Phases II and III; ie, the marketing of "Intelligent Design." And in the service of that marketing, the authors of the book cite numerous documents which attest to the indefatigable enthusiasm and obsessive attention to detail the IDiots possess.

The first step was rhetorical. They eliminated all the normal frames and definitions of science and created new ones that gave them an argumentative advantage.** For example, IDiots redefined science to include two different possible approaches - "methodological naturalism" and "theistic realism." And so, evolution can be recast as "Darwinism," a "naturalist" theory while "Intelligent Design" is an example of "realist" theory.

With evolution now defined as "non-realist," it becomes easy to assert that "Intelligent Design" deserves at least equal status. And so they have.

The IDiots' assault on the discourse of science has been thorough, even encylopedic. We encounter notions like "Irreducible Complexity" or "Complex Specified Information" and the impressive acronyms they spawn. it's all nonsense, but they don't give a hoot because, in the words of the inventor of "methodological naturalism: "My goal is not so much to win the argument as to legitimate it as part of the dialogue. And increasingly in the public's eye, it seems that they have.

To "legitimate" IDiocy, they have polished their sophistries to a fine sheen and used them not only to undermine the public discourse on science but also everywhere else in their strategy. Here's one example:

One day before the senate was to vote on the "Better Education For Students and Teachers Act," Senator Rick Santorum, he of "man on dog" fame, introduced an amendment conducive to IDiocy. He said it addressed "the subject of intellectual freedom." The language was so perfectly crafted that it bamboozled even the streetwise Ted Kennedy, who spoke in favor of it as did Robert Byrd. The amendment passed 91-8. And the IDiots pounced immediately, writing schoolboards requesting (ie demanding) that "Intelligent Design" get equal time in science classrooms. Once Santorum's snotty little ruse was exposed for what it was, it was deleted and the language inserted into some less prominent "Joint Explanatory Statement" but it was too late. The IDiots still refer to the Santorum Amendment when advancing their case.

A few words on the phrase "intellectual freedom." Just as leftover duck's feet get sold as Dim Sum, nothing is ever wasted in "Intelligent Design" advocacy. Having invented the concept that the teaching of IDiocy is about "intellectual freedom," IDiot lawyers have been trained to sue school boards, claiming First Amendment infringement if IDiocy is excluded from science classes.

Creationism's Trojan Horse has numerous other examples and many references to the planning documents of the IDiots. In addition to the rhetorical examples, you can also trace the development of the "victimization" theme so prevalent on the right ("They won't let us teach alternate scientific theories" is all of a piece with "What about white people's rights?" Or little Ben's book title, "It's my country, too"). But with "Intelligent Design," the rightwing had to explain so much about how they were going to wreck science that we can see all the cogs and wheels come into place and start to spin.

While the story is a grim one (terrifying for those of us who care passionately about our children and good science), there is reason for hope. A careful reader can treat the marketing documents of the IDiots as an instruction manual: s/hewill learn how to successfully market, publicize, and proslyetize a complex, abstract idea. Two can play at this game given enough money, effort, and the conviction that the game is worth playing.[/[/i]B]

IDiocy can be beaten back to the margins of American culture, where it belongs. Besides, what's the alternative? In The Wedge Strategy, the IDiots make it perfectly clear what they're doing and what their ultimate goal is:

Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture seeks nothing less than the overthrow of materialism [they mean "empirical science"] and its cultural legacies... Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions. And they are well along the way.

*Readers who are familiar with the issues regarding evolution only through the shamefully biased mainstream reporting of IDiocy may be surprised to learn that there is not only no science at all behind the "Intelligent Design" movement, but not even any relevant scientific research that's been published by the movement. Even though there are a few trained scientists among the advocates of IDiocy, their scientific research has not been relevant to "Intelligent Design" issues. At best, they have merely theorized and hypothesized and tried to poke holes in modern day evolution science. More often than not, they simply refer to popular books or articles published in "Intelligent Design" or "Christian" magazines, which have have never been peer reviewed (and would never stand up to scrutiny).

The IDiot who appears to be the most difficult to dismiss on the scientific substance is one William Dembski, who has written book after book chockablock with abstruse "mathematics." There are very few people qualified to slog through his work, but those who have report that Dembski resorts more than not to mathematisms - that is, pretentious and vacuous symbology that looks like real math - rather than the real thing. Dembski's real work, the book makes clear, is in christian apologetics and evangelization. As Dembski says, "Indeed, intelligent design [sic] is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory."

In other words, in spite of the fact that there is no science behind it at all - nor much interest, as the book makes clear, in doing any real science - the advocates of "Intelligent Design" want equal time in science classes.

This very deliberate technique - a calculated disinterest in the facts combined with a breathtakingly aggressive assertion of lies - has also been deployed very effectively in the service of other causes, for example the statements by Bush and others that entirely misrepresent the conclusions of the 9/11 report, the Duelfer report and so on.

To be sure, that politics makes strange bedfellows is not news. What is news is that the rising power of the religious right is leading to some unexpected victories for progressive causes. Deep political polarization makes traditional centrist bipartisanship treacherous. But, paradoxically, it can also produce unexpected cooperation between the core of the right and the core of the left. In other words, bipartisanship isn't dead; it has simply abandoned the political center for issues where it was once nowhere to be seen.

That's from the article pasted in below. It will serve as exhibit B for an old argument of mine: you should react to the rise of the Religious Right not only, or not even primarily, with a frontal attack on it, but by smartly using it to create new Progressive majorities.

Blue-staters alone can not win elections. To bridge that crucial fifthiest percentile point, you need some alliance. Many liberals seem to be seeking it with social libertarians, hammering on the separation of church and state while fudging away the issues of socio-economic equality and redistribution that would chase such affluent libertarians away. I think that's a losing strategy - if only because while secular values do not need leftists to survive, issues of socio-economic equality do.

With support of the US equivalent of the Christian Union (see <a href="http://www.able2know.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1229704#1229704">here</a> and <a href="http://www.able2know.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1230085#1230085">here</a> ), new majorities can be created for a more populist, but no less Progressive line - even for such largely un populist, conscientious issues such as the one outlined in the article. Fighting poverty, at home and in Africa. Protecting the environment. Fighting corruption. And this here.

Lola <a href="http://www.able2know.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1230115#1230115">asserted</a> that the US doesn't have an equivalent to the Christian Union. I think she's wrong.

To the Extreme
by Kal Raustiala

I t is commonplace to claim that bipartisanship is dead--or at least dying. Last week, on The New York Times op-ed page, Norm Ornstein argued that political polarization is at a 50-year high in Congress. Ornstein showed that only 8 percent of the House can be considered centrist today, compared to 33 percent in 1955.

In light of Ornstein's findings, the first meeting of the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission, which took place in Washington last month, is puzzling--and noteworthy. Senators from both sides of the aisle spoke, and the commission heard testimony from activists, Justice Department officials, and rape survivors. The panel was created by the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003, which sailed through Congress two years ago with unanimous bipartisan support and was later signed by President Bush.

How, at a time when bipartisanship is said to be dead, did a bill addressing American prisons--a topic not lacking in ideological overtones--pass unanimously? The answer illustrates an important fact about bipartisanship in polarized times. The absence of centrists in Congress certainly fosters conflict rather than cooperation on many, probably most, issues. But there are also issues where the most liberal Democrats and the most conservative Republicans can find common ground. To be sure, that politics makes strange bedfellows is not news. What is news is that the rising power of the religious right is leading to some unexpected victories for progressive causes. Deep political polarization makes traditional centrist bipartisanship treacherous. But, paradoxically, it can also produce unexpected cooperation between the core of the right and the core of the left. In other words, bipartisanship isn't dead; it has simply abandoned the political center for issues where it was once nowhere to be seen.

T he Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) is a good example of this phenomenon. Sexual assault, sometimes by guards but more often by other prisoners, is a fact of life behind bars. Research shows that nearly 1 in 10 male inmates has been raped, gay men disproportionately. The problem of prisoner rape is not new, but the issue had no traction for decades. Starting about five years ago, however, prisoner rape began to get attention.

In 2001, Human Rights Watch released a report on rape behind bars that was prominently featured on the front page of The New York Times. At the same time, the survivor-founded group Stop Prisoner Rape initiated a campaign that forced 7UP to pull a television commercial making light of the issue. Many conservative groups signed on to the campaign, including the evangelical Prison Fellowship Ministries, led by Watergate-era figure Chuck Colson. The media attention to both events dovetailed with ongoing work on the issue at the conservative Hudson Institute and coverage in publications such as Christianity Today.

Conservative religious groups, many of which minister in prisons, witnessed the problem firsthand. More traditional conservatives recognized a law-and-order problem they could attack. And the fact that much of the sex in question was male-on-male surely added to the right's indignation. For the left, prison conditions have long been a concern--and a losing cause. But once Christian conservatives joined forces with groups like Amnesty International, the topic went from a political loser to a political winner. On conservative talk radio, advocates still faced hostile questions. But on Capitol Hill, few wanted to come out against a campaign that had garnered support from both the NAACP and Focus on the Family. Ted Kennedy and Rick Santorum suddenly were on the same team.

The PREA is an important story, one in which an appalling problem is finally addressed by Congress. But it is also part of a trend. In recent months, for example, the unusual convergence of the religious right and environmentalists has received increasing attention. "Creation care" is the new phrase du jour for environmentally minded Christians who think there is a scriptural duty to protect the Earth and all its inhabitants. Christian conservatives have also aligned with the left to campaign against the international sex trafficking trade. Conservatives are increasingly in line with liberals on the need to aggressively challenge and prevent religious and racial persecution in places like Darfur. And perhaps most significantly, national security hawks and climate change advocates are suddenly on the same page with regard to fossil fuel consumption--since, in addition to creating greenhouse gases, American consumption of oil also enriches Saudi Arabia, birthplace of fifteen of the 9/11 hijackers.

It's easy to argue there is nothing new in these coalitions. Prohibition is frequently said to have had two chief political supporters: Baptists who hated demon drink and bootleggers who smuggled it to everyone else. Whether or not that particular story is apocryphal, alliances of convenience--that is, "Baptist-bootlegger" coalitions--are hardly unusual in American politics. But the prison sexual assault issue pushes beyond these traditional kinds of arrangements. Rather than linking advocates of conscience (Baptists) to those seeking private gain (bootleggers), it connects advocates of conscience from opposite ends of the political spectrum. And in doing so, it reaches much further across the aisle than bipartisan efforts generally have.

This unusual brand of bipartisanship stems as much from the creation of gerrymandered electoral districts as it does from the rising power of the religious right. Congress lacks a center because the public, divided into ever-more homogenous and safe districts, no longer elects centrists.

The implications of this shift for congressional politics are significant. Our constitutional structure has a status quo bias that forces compromise if new initiatives are to move forward. Bipartisanship used to be more or less synonymous with the political center, where those compromises were forged. But the alliances that have formed around prison rape, the environment, and Darfur suggest that today it is less the center than the poles that are most likely to be areas of common cause. When Christian conservatives such as Chuck Colson can partner with Amnesty International to push through a bill, bipartisanship is not so much dead as transformed. In a sense, this is unsurprising: The center, as Ornstein tells us, has withered away. Bipartisanship has nowhere to go but out. This may make strange-bedfellow arrangements hard. But it can also make very-strange-bedfellow arrangements surprisingly easy.

Ralph Reed's Gamble
by JACK NEWFIELD

[from the July 12, 2004 issue]

When Ralph Reed was the boyish director of the Christian Coalition, he made opposition to gambling a major plank in his "family values" agenda, calling gambling "a cancer on the American body politic" that was "stealing food from the mouths of children." But now, a broad federal investigation into lobbying abuses connected to gambling on Indian reservations has unearthed evidence that Reed has been surreptitiously working for an Indian tribe with a large casino it sought to protect--and that Reed was paid with funds laundered through two firms to try to keep his lucrative involvement secret. Reed has always operated behind the scenes, and apparently he didn't want to risk becoming a humbled hypocrite like his right-wing cohorts William Bennett and Rush Limbaugh.

News accounts of the emerging scandal have focused on the two main figures under investigation: lawyer/lobbyist Jack Abramoff and Mike Scanlon, House GOP majority leader Tom DeLay's former spokesman and head of two campaign and public relations companies. But Reed has managed to slither below the media's radar--until now.

Neither he, Abramoff or Scanlon returned phone calls.

Michael Scanlon, a former business partner of the lobbyist Jack Abramoff and a former top aide to Representative Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican, pleaded guilty on Monday to conspiring to bribe a member of Congress and other public officials. He agreed to repay $19.6 million to his former Indian tribe lobbying clients.

Scanlon acknowledged in a plea agreement that he and Abramoff, identified in the court papers as "Lobbyist A," agreed to make lavish gifts to public officials, including all-expense-paid trips to Europe and the Super Bowl, in exchange for official actions.

Federal law enforcement officials portrayed the plea agreement, under which Scanlon faces up to five years in prison, as an important development in the larger criminal investigation of Abramoff, who has been under scrutiny by a grand jury for more than a year.

The investigation, which initially centered on accusations that Abramoff had defrauded Indian tribe casinos of tens of millions of dollars in lobbying fees, has created alarm on Capitol Hill, where the lobbyist and his junior partner, Scanlon, claimed friendships among the Republican leaders of Congress.

Prosecutors have not named any of the public officials who were the targets of Scanlon's scheme.

But court papers in the case filed Monday and last week singled out one member of Congress, "Representative No. 1," as a focus of Scanlon's illegal lobbying.

Those filings assert that the lawmaker accepted gifts, including a 2002 golf trip to Scotland and regular meals at Abramoff's restaurant, Signatures, "in exchange for a series of official acts and influence."

Representative Bob Ney, an Ohio Republican and chairman of the House Administration Committee, has acknowledged that he is the lawmaker, while saying there was no quid pro quo with Abramoff or Scanlon.

Ney, who was subpoenaed this month by the grand jury investigating Abramoff, has said he was "duped" by the lobbyists.

"All this plea agreement shows is that Scanlon had a secret and well-concealed scheme to defraud many people and, it appears, unfortunately, that Representative Ney was one of the many people defrauded," said Brian Walsh, the spokesman for Ney.

Scanlon, 35, a longtime Republican operative in the capital, said little during the hearing Monday in U.S. District Court.

"Guilty, your honor," he replied calmly when asked by Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle for his plea. Under the agreement with the Justice Department, Scanlon pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate a series of criminal laws, including those against bribery, and pledged to cooperate with the Justice Department's investigation of Abramoff and others.

At a news conference after the hearing, Scanlon's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, stood alongside his client and said Scanlon was "obviously regretful" about the fraud committed against the Indian tribes, which paid Abramoff and Scanlon more than $80 million in fees.

Asked if he expected the investigation to bring many members of Congress under scrutiny, Cacheris replied, "I would rather not comment on that." Asked if Scanlon had information that would bring DeLay under investigation, the lawyer replied, "You'll have to ask his lawyers."

Before turning to lobbying in 2000, Scanlon was press secretary to DeLay, the former House majority leader, who is under indictment in Texas on unrelated charges of violating state election laws.

All kinds. This is Ralph Reed hehehehehe and Tom DeLay (as if he weren't in trouble already) and many others. Have to love Michael Scanlon, he's not about to go down alone. He's repaying 19 million but he's earned many millions more than that. He doesn't look like he's worried about money.

Corruption Inquiry Threatens to Ensnare Lawmakers
By PHILIP SHENON

WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 - The Justice Department has signaled for the first time in recent weeks that prominent members of Congress could be swept up in the corruption investigation of Jack Abramoff, the former Republican superlobbyist who diverted some of his tens of millions of dollars in fees to provide lavish travel, meals and campaign contributions to the lawmakers whose help he needed most.

The investigation by a federal grand jury, which began more than a year ago, has created alarm on Capitol Hill, especially with the announcement Friday of criminal charges against Michael Scanlon, Mr. Abramoff's former lobbying partner and a former top House aide to Representative Tom DeLay.

The charges against Mr. Scanlon identified no lawmakers by name, but a summary of the case released by the Justice Department accused him of being part of a broad conspiracy to provide "things of value, including money, meals, trips and entertainment to federal public officials in return for agreements to perform official acts" - an attempt at bribery, in other words, or something close to it.

Mr. Abramoff, who is under indictment in a separate bank-fraud case in Florida, has not been charged by the federal grand jury here. But Mr. Scanlon's lawyer says he has agreed to plead guilty and cooperate in the investigation, suggesting that Mr. Abramoff's day in court in Washington is only a matter of time.

Scholars who specialize in the history and operations of Congress say that given the brazenness of Mr. Abramoff's lobbying efforts, as measured by the huge fees he charged clients and the extravagant gifts he showered on friends on Capitol Hill, almost all of them Republicans, the investigation could end up costing several lawmakers their careers, if not their freedom.

The investigation threatens to ensnarl many outside Congress as well, including Interior Department officials and others in the Bush administration who were courted by Mr. Abramoff on behalf of the Indian tribe casinos that were his most lucrative clients.

The inquiry has already reached into the White House; a White House budget official, David H. Safavian, resigned only days before his arrest in September on charges of lying to investigators about his business ties to Mr. Abramoff, a former lobbying partner.

"I think this has the potential to be the biggest scandal in Congress in over a century," said Thomas E. Mann, a Congressional specialist at the Brookings Institution. "I've been around Washington for 35 years, watching Congress, and I've never seen anything approaching Abramoff for cynicism and chutzpah in proposing quid pro quos to members of Congress."

Even by the gold-plated standards of Washington lobbying firms, the fees paid to Mr. Abramoff were extraordinary. A former president of the College Republicans who turned to lobbying after a short-lived career as a B-movie producer, Mr. Abramoff, with his lobbying team, collected more than $80 million from the Indian tribes and their gambling operations; he was known by lobbying rivals as "Casino Jack."

Mr. Abramoff's lobbying work was not limited to the casinos, though. Newly disclosed documents from his files show that he asked for $9 million in 2003 from the president of Gabon, in West Africa, to set up a White House meeting with President Bush; there was an Oval Office meeting last year, although there is no evidence in the public record to show that Mr. Abramoff had a role in the arrangements.

Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21, an ethics watchdog group that has called for tighter lobbying rules, said it was too early to say whether the Abramoff investigation would produce anything like the convulsion in Congress during the Abscam investigations of the 1980's, when one senator and five House members were convicted on bribery and other charges after an F.B.I. sting involving a phony Arab sheik.

"But this clearly has the potential," Mr. Wertheimer said.

So far, one member of Congress, Representative Bob Ney, an Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Administration Committee, has acknowledged receiving a subpoena from the grand jury investigating Mr. Abramoff. Another, Representative John T. Doolittle, Republican of California, has acknowledged that his wife, who helped Mr. Abramoff organize fund-raisers, was subpoenaed.

The Justice Department signaled last month that Mr. DeLay had come under scrutiny in the investigation, over a trip that Mr. Abramoff arranged for Mr. DeLay and his wife to Britain in 2000 that included rounds of golf at the fabled course at St. Andrews in Scotland.

The department revealed its interest in Mr. DeLay, who is under indictment in Texas in an unrelated investigation involving violations of state election laws, in an extraordinary request to the British government that police there interview former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about the circumstances of a meeting in London with Mr. DeLay during the trip five years ago.

London newspapers quoted a document prepared by the British Home Office that outlined the Justice Department's investigation and said that "it is alleged that Abramoff arranged for his clients to pay for the trips to the U.K. on the basis that Congressman DeLay would support favorable legislation."

Richard Cullen, a lawyer for Mr. DeLay, said in an interview Friday that he was "glad that the Justice Department is looking into all aspects of the trip because I think that a thorough investigation will show that the trip was substantive and transparent."

Mr. Cullen said that shortly after he was hired several months ago, he contacted the Justice Department "to let them know that Mr. DeLay is available to cooperate in any way."

The lawyer said he was "convinced that when the Justice Department completes its investigation of Abramoff and Scanlon, that it will be clear Tom DeLay has acted ethically and has conducted himself consistent with all laws and House standards of conduct." He said he had not heard from federal prosecutors since the initial contacts.

The situation could be more serious for Mr. Ney, a five-term lawmaker whose position as chairman of the House Administration Committee gives him power over the operations of the Capitol building and allows him to divide up Congressional perks like office space and parking.

Mr. Ney's ties to Mr. Abramoff have been revealed slowly over the last year, largely through testimony before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, which has held a series of hearings into accusations that Mr. Abramoff and Mr. Scanlon defrauded their Indian tribe clients.

Mr. Ney was not identified by name in the documents filed against Mr. Scanlon on Friday. But the Ohio lawmaker's lawyers acknowledged that Mr. Ney was the lawmaker identified as "Representative #1" in the Justice Department papers, which charged Mr. Scanlon with conspiring to provide "Representative #1" with a golfing trip to Scotland, meals at Mr. Abramoff's Washington restaurant and campaign contributions.

Mr. Ney took part in a golf trip to Scotland in 2002 with Mr. Abramoff, where they played at St. Andrews, as Mr. DeLay had done two years earlier. Documents and testimony to Congress showed that Mr. Abramoff had asked an Indian tribe in Texas to sponsor the trip and that Mr. Ney was then asked for his help in trying to reopen a casino owned by the tribe that had been shuttered by state officials.

Mr. Ney was also a regular at Signatures, the expensive Washington restaurant that Mr. Abramoff owned and used to entertain clients, colleagues and lawmakers. Former Signatures employees have said that Mr. Ney frequently ate and drank at the restaurant without paying. Mr. Ney has acknowledged the gifts but said they were within limits set by Congressional ethics rules.

Ralph Reed's Zeal for Lobbying Is Shaking His Political Faithful
By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK
and PHILIP SHENON

Published: April 18, 2005

ATLANTA - In 30 years of culture wars, few conservative Christian standard bearers have traveled further in American politics than Ralph Reed. The former head of the Christian Coalition has been a high-priced communications consultant, a top Bush campaign adviser, chairman of Georgia's Republican Party and now a candidate for lieutenant governor here.

Campaigning in early April at a Republican district meeting outside Atlanta, Mr. Reed talked of his small-town roots in northeast Georgia.

"I'm not going to forget where I came from," he said. "I am not going to forget what I stand for."

But as he completes his journey from Christian advocate to professional politician, Mr. Reed, 43, finds himself carrying some baggage: his ties to an old friend, the Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
In Washington, federal investigations of Mr. Abramoff, a close ally of Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, have revealed that Mr. Abramoff paid Mr. Reed's consulting firm more than $4 million to help organize Christian opposition to Indian casinos in Texas and Louisiana - money that came from other Indians with rival casinos.

Mr. Reed declined to comment for this article; he has said publicly that he did not know that casino owners were paying for his services and that he has never deviated from his moral opposition to gambling. But the episode is a new blemish on the boyish face that once personified the rise of evangelical Christians to political power in America.

Some of Mr. Reed's past patrons - including the Rev. Pat Robertson, the Christian broadcaster who set Mr. Reed on the national stage by hiring him to run the Christian Coalition - say his work with Mr. Abramoff's Indian casino clients raises questions about how he has balanced his personal ambitions with his Christian principles.

"You know that song about the Rhinestone Cowboy, 'There's been a load of compromising on the road to my horizon,' " Mr. Robertson said. "The Bible says you can't serve God and Mammon."

In Georgia, Mr. Reed's rival in the Republican primary is playing up his links with Indian casinos to try to revive longstanding criticism from conservative Christian purists that Mr. Reed has sometimes put his own ambitions ahead of their goals. At the meeting near Atlanta, for example, his opponents were doing their best to sow doubts in the crowd.

"The Christian Coalition, they may have some shady background," said Robert McIntyre, the treasurer of the Spalding County Republican Party, who still wore a Ralph Reed sticker on his lapel. "I was being loyal to Ralph Reed, but since now some things have come up, I need to listen. I am now wavering."

Others argue, however, that shaking soiled hands is sometimes the price of making an impact.

"Thirty or 40 years ago, the people who you would see as the spokesmen for traditional values kind of things were people who were outsiders railing against the system," said Kelly Shackelford, a prominent Christian conservative and president of the Free Market Foundation in Texas. "And if they didn't get a hundred percent of what they believe in, they weren't going to play." Mr. Reed led a new wave of Christian conservatives, Mr. Shackelford said, who "understand that you have to be part of the system, and you can't sit outside and throw rocks at everybody."

Bill Paxon, a former Congressman turned lobbyist who worked closely with Mr. Reed on Republican Congressional campaigns, said Mr. Reed was a man of many dimensions: a heartfelt Christian, a limited-government conservative and a canny political street fighter. "He was always all of the above," Mr. Paxon said.

Unlike most conservative Christian leaders, Mr. Reed was drawn to Republican politics first and evangelical faith later. He arrived in Washington as a 19-year-old Senate intern in 1981 and became executive director of the College Republican National Committee two years later, under Mr. Abramoff as chairman.

Mr. Abramoff was "a conservative firebrand," Mr. Reed wrote in his book "Active Faith." The men became so close that Mr. Reed sometimes slept on Mr. Abramoff's couch and later introduced Mr. Abramoff to his future wife.

The same year he joined the College Republicans, Mr. Reed started attending an evangelical church and became born again. "I was a bare-knuckled political operative," Mr. Reed wrote in his book. "In the rough and tumble of politics, I began to sense the need for spiritual roots."
</quote>

<quote>
By 1999, Mr. Abramoff, who was well known as a lobbyist for Indian casinos, had hired Mr. Reed's firm to help organize antigambling campaigns in Texas and Louisiana.

Lisa Baron, a spokeswoman for Mr. Reed's firm, said that Mr. Abramoff had told Mr. Reed that the payment for his consulting services came from a "broad-based coalition" of antigambling groups. "We did not know who his specific clients were or their specific interests," Ms. Baron said.

In fact, Mr. Abramoff had recruited Mr. Reed to help the Coushatta Indians of Louisiana shut down or block casinos operated or proposed by the Tiguas, in neighboring Texas, or the Jena Band of Choctaws, in Louisiana, according to disclosures by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, which is investigating $82 million in lobbying fees that Mr. Abramoff and his partner, Michael Scanlon, reaped from tribes.

Masters of Sleaze
By DAVID BROOKS

Published: March 22, 2005

Down in the depths of the netherworld, where Tammany Hall grafters and Chicago ward heelers gather amid spittoons and brass railings, a reverential silence now spreads across the communion. The sleazemasters of old look back into the land of the mortals and they see greatness in the form of Jack Abramoff.

Only a genius like Abramoff could make money lobbying against an Indian tribe's casino and then turn around and make money defending that tribe against himself. Only a giant like Abramoff would have the guts to use one tribe's casino money to finance a Focus on the Family crusade against gambling in order to shut down a rival tribe's casino.

Only an artist like Abramoff could suggest to a tribe that it pay him by taking out life insurance policies on its eldest members. Then when the elders dropped off they could funnel the insurance money through a private school and into his pockets.

This is sleaze of a high order. And yet according to reports in The Washington Post and elsewhere, Abramoff accomplished it all.

Yet it's important to remember this: A genius like Abramoff doesn't spring fully formed on his own. Just as Michelangelo emerged in the ferment of Renaissance Italy, so did Abramoff emerge from his own circle of creativity and encouragement.

Back in 1995, when Republicans took over Congress, a new cadre of daring and original thinkers arose. These bold innovators had a key insight: that you no longer had to choose between being an activist and a lobbyist. You could be both. You could harness the power of K Street to promote the goals of Goldwater, Reagan and Gingrich. And best of all, you could get rich while doing it!

Before long, ringleader Grover Norquist and his buddies were signing lobbying deals with the Seychelles and the Northern Mariana Islands and talking up their interests at weekly conservative strategy sessions - what could be more vital to the future of freedom than the commercial interests of these two fine locales?

Before long, folks like Norquist and Abramoff were talking up the virtues of international sons of liberty like Angola's Jonas Savimbi and Congo's dictator Mobutu Sese Seko - all while receiving compensation from these upstanding gentlemen, according to The Legal Times. Only a reactionary could have been so discomfited by Savimbi's little cannibalism problem as to think this was not a daring contribution to the cause of Reaganism.

Soon the creative revolutionaries were blending the high-toned forms of the think tank with the low-toned scams of the buckraker. Ed Buckham, Tom DeLay's former chief of staff, helped run the U.S. Family Network, which supported the American family by accepting large donations and leasing skyboxes at the MCI Center, according to Roll Call. Michael Scanlon, DeLay's former spokesman, organized a think tank called the American International Center, located in a house in Rehoboth Beach, Del., which was occupied, according to Andrew Ferguson's devastating compendium in The Weekly Standard, by a former "lifeguard of the year" and a former yoga instructor.

Ralph Reed, meanwhile, smashed the tired old categories that used to separate social conservatives from corporate consultants. Reed signed on with Channel One, Verizon, Enron and Microsoft to shore up the moral foundations of our great nation. Reed so strongly opposes gambling as a matter of principle that he bravely accepted $4 million through Abramoff from casino-rich Indian tribes to gin up a grass-roots campaign.

As time went by, the spectacular devolution of morals accelerated. Many of the young innovators were behaving like people who, having read Barry Goldwater's "Conscience of a Conservative," embraced the conservative part while discarding the conscience part.

Abramoff's and Scanlon's Indian-gaming scandal will go down as the movement's crowning achievement, more shameless than anything the others would do, but still the culmination of the trends building since 1995. It perfectly embodied their creed and philosophy: "I'd love us to get our mitts on that moolah!!" as Abramoff wrote to Reed.

They made at least $66 million.

This is a major accomplishment. And remember: Abramoff didn't do it on his own.

It took a village. The sleazo-cons thought they could take over K Street to advance their agenda. As it transpired, K Street took over them.

The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana (the "Tribe") used the slogan "Concerned Citizens Against Gaming Expansion" in its to opposition to a proposition election on April 6, 2002 to allow a riverboat casino to operate in Calcasieu Parish. (The tribe's competition)

The Tribe spent $156,642.72 for advertisements, mailers, and telephone solicitations to oppose the proposition, all of which said paid for by "Concerned Citizens Against Gaming Expansion." The newspaper, radio and television advertisements ran between March 29, 2002 and April 6, 2002. The telephone solicitations occurred on April 1, 2002.

The Tribe did not timely file reports in connection with the April 6, 2002 proposition election.

Section 1486 of the Act requires any person who spends more than $200 in support or opposition to a proposition election to file campaign finance reports. In accordance with that section, the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana was required to file a Special Report by April 3, 2002, and a 40th day after the election by May 16, 2002. The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana did not file the required reports until October 23, 2002.

Section 1505.4A(2)(a)(iv) of the Act provides that a per day penalty of $40 per day, up to a maximum of $1,000, be assessed against a person who supports or opposes a proposition and fails to timely file campaign finance disclosure reports. Section 1505.4A(4) of the Act BD 2002-202
Page of

provides that a person may be assessed an additional civil penalty of up to $10,000 for the failure to timely file the reports.

Considering the above facts, the Board concludes that the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana violated the provisions of Section 1505.1B of the Act and that late fees of $240 and $1,000 should be assessed for the Tribe's failure to timely file the Special and the 40th day after the election campaign finance disclosure reports, respectively, as well as an additional civil penalty of $5,000 per each report for violating Section 1505.1B of the Act.

By Order of the Board this 12th day of December, 2002.

I noted this item on another thread too.

Actually, both you and Lola are more optimistic than I regarding the self-destructiveness of this contingent within the movement and party. We'll get a better notion in October and a much better notion in two years. Reed's defeat is a good indicator but they are well organized, deeply motivated, and have significant reach into the below the radar government operations, so still formidable. As things stand, the RNC still cannot do without their support, organizationally and electorally, so any bactracking away from pleasing them in order to avoid loss of support from moderates still looks a ways off in the future, if ever. The stem cell veto is a case in point.

And yes it is good, especially for those of us who are actually right. They (the fanatical fundamentalists of all types) are quite dangerous if ignored and the Christian fundies are no exception. They have been very well organized and financed, supported by certain factions within the media..........fortunately these types can be depended on to sooner or later pee in their own post toasties, which it appears they have done. But fundamentalist urinie would have gone unnoticed had there not been those of us who recognized the danger and were ready to pounce at earliest opportunity. Fanaticism feeds on the illusion of absolute control and they never give up. They can't. So it's up to us all to work against their goals.

I agree with Bernie in that the threat is not gone. I'll admit that they avoided too many mistakes for a lot longer than I expected. I was losing hope a bit. I disagree with Bernie in that he sometimes believes that no amount of action will stop the threat. But he's always been a little bit cynical and pessimistic.

Afghanistan Deports Christian Koreans

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
Published: August 3, 2006
Filed at 4:10 p.m. ET

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Afghanistan on Thursday ordered hundreds of South Korean Christians to leave the country, accusing them of seeking to undermine Islamic culture.

The Korean group's leader, Choi Han-woo, denied its 1,200 members, who gathered in Afghanistan for relief work and a cultural festival, took part in any religious activities.

However, Interior Ministry spokesman Yousef Stanezai said that although the Koreans came with tourist visas, their activities showed they had a different agenda.

''The program was against the Islamic culture and customs of Afghans,'' he said, adding they have been told to leave the country as soon as possible.

Now there's an analysis not much beyond a slogan or cliche.

What is "the little"? A veto on stem cells? A Bush appearance at a pulpit where Condi wouldn't be terribly welcome? A foreign policy derived from thorough-going textual investigations of Revelations?

There's good reason to conclude that America is now more divisive and effectively and implacably at war with itself now than was the case in the 60s. This is one clear consequence of the modern conservative movement's strategies to create or activate a largely reactive populist electorate.

You minimize, at the peril of much that represents the best of your nation, the red-meat-devouring beast that has been created. It isn't merely the rabid religious element. In tandem with the same sort of nationalist extremism, it is getting uglier all the time, george.

America's Holy Warriors

By Chris Hedges, Truthdig. Posted January 4, 2007.

The radical Christian Right is coming dangerously close to its goal of taking over the country's military and law enforcement.

The drive by the Christian right to take control of military chaplaincies, which now sees radical Christians holding roughly 50 percent of chaplaincy appointments in the armed services and service academies, is part of a much larger effort to politicize the military and law enforcement. This effort signals the final and perhaps most deadly stage in the long campaign by the radical Christian right to dismantle America's open society and build a theocratic state. A successful politicization of the military would signal the end of our democracy.

The most notorious example of this attempt to drum up a religious-based "will" to wage war came to light in 2003 with press reports of speeches delivered by Lt. Gen. William "Jerry" Boykin, the deputy undersecretary of defense for intelligence, to audiences assembled by the Christian right.

Boykin repeatedly told audiences that the war was being waged by a "Christian army" and a "Christian nation" against Islamic forces aligned with Satan. He proclaimed that his own confidence in victory over a Muslim foe was based on the knowledge that "my God was bigger than his... my God was a real god and his was an idol." He likewise declared that George W. Bush was "appointed by God," despite having failed to win the majority of the votes in 2000, and indicated that he saw himself as answerable only to God's commands.

While the general's anti-Islamic bigotry and profoundly anti-democratic remarks provoked outrage, the Republican right and the Bush administration leapt to his defense. The general himself asked that a Pentagon inspector general investigate the controversy. The result was a report that avoided the content of Boykin's remarks, delivering only the mildest rebuke for his failure to assert that they were his personal opinion and to clear them first with superiors.

General Boykin remains to this day the senior uniformed officer in military intelligence and a top policy-maker in the "war on terror," overseeing assassination squads, illegal abductions and torture.

<quote>
ARLINGTON, Va. (ABP) -- The influence of evangelical Christians in the military's highest ranks is again under question, after complaints about an evangelical group's promotional video that features several top-ranking Pentagon officers, some in uniform.

The Pentagon inspector general's office received the complaint from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation. The foundation -- founded earlier this year by an Air Force veteran who made headlines in a dispute over evangelical influences at the Air Force Academy -- made the complaint public Dec. 11.

The video appears on the website of the Christian Embassy, a Washington-area institution that serves high-level leaders in the federal government and the city's diplomatic community.

The organization is an outgrowth of Campus Crusade for Christ, an international evangelism and discipleship group for students.

Referring to the Pentagon's 20,000-plus employees, the video's narrator states: "Through Bible studies, discipleship, prayer breakfasts and outreach events, Christian Embassy is mustering these men and women into an intentional relationship with Jesus Christ."

The Military Religious Freedom Foundation's complaint, addressed to Thomas Gimble, the Pentagon's acting inspector general, said the appearance of Department of Defense employees in the video violates several military rules, including rules against active-duty service members promoting political or religious causes while in uniform.

The Rise of Christian Fascism and Its Threat to American Democracy
By Chris Hedges, Truthdig
Posted on February 8, 2007, Printed on February 8, 2007
<a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/47679/">http://www.alternet.org/story/47679/</a>
Dr. James Luther Adams, my ethics professor at Harvard Divinity School, told his students that when we were his age -- he was then close to 80 -- we would all be fighting the "Christian fascists."

The warning, given 25 years ago, came at the moment Pat Robertson and other radio and television evangelists began speaking about a new political religion that would direct its efforts toward taking control of all institutions, including mainstream denominations and the government. Its stated goal was to use the United States to create a global Christian empire. This call for fundamentalists and evangelicals to take political power was a radical and ominous mutation of traditional Christianity. It was hard, at the time, to take such fantastic rhetoric seriously, especially given the buffoonish quality of those who expounded it. But Adams warned us against the blindness caused by intellectual snobbery. The Nazis, he said, were not going to return with swastikas and brown shirts. Their ideological inheritors had found a mask for fascism in the pages of the Bible.

I'm not impressed, and I'd even say this if I agreed with the basic thesis and didn't find it way exaggerated.

When an author writes an article titled "the rise of Christian fascism and its threat to American democracy", I expect him to supply arguments for two propositions: 1) the sort of Christians that may usefully be compared with European fascists is rising, and 2) they pose a threat to American democracy. Chris Hedges asserts both points, but presents no discernible evidence for either. All he gives is arguments from the authority of his teacher, James Luther Adams. Most of us don't know James Luther Adams, and have no reason to accept his word on current events. For us, Hedges doesn't offer any reason to change our minds. His article preaches to the converted.

<quote>
No offense, but I think the religious right has been the most overhyped threat in this decade's US politics.

Think about it. What three basic pillars of support and ideology have the Bush administrations leant on?

the tax-cutting, corporate-friendly, corruption-tolerant, free market ideologues and big business pals

the war-starting, executive power-entrenching, overreaching neoconservatives who were going to change the world in America's image by force

the evangelical, puritan, culture war-fighting religious right with its obsession with abortion and gay marriage. For sure, each constituency has tolerated or even approved of the actions of the others, brought together in their common pragmatic grab for power and shared distaste for anything liberal. But they're still three - the three, IMO - easily identifiable separate strands of Bushism.

OK, now ask yourself: which of these three strands has had the most influence, these past six years? Which of them succeeded best in getting their pet laws and policies pushed through? Which of the three has best succeeded in changing America in its own image? And which the least?

Face it: of the three, the religious right is the strand that got shafted. The highest ranking pol they got in Bush's admin was Ashcroft, and he dissappeared halfway through. Theres been hardly any change on abortion. Their agenda has come to be symbolised by the Schiavo debacle, which made Frist and the lot look foolish, and which they even lost, too. The only notch they can carve is the state referendums they won on gay marriage, and some of those were only symbolic.

The Bush era will forever be identified by Iraq and the monumental failure there of the neoconservative project. Once withdrawal from there ensues, however, the Bush era feature that will turn out to have had the most far-reaching impact in the US will be the huge, ideologically-inspired tax cut bonanza giveaway to the richest, and the deregulation of whole chunks of what remained of the government's ability to check market abuses that came with it. The religious right's agenda, on the other hand? As long as you're not gay, it's been a mere, and rather comical, blip on the radar.

And now the new presidential elections are going to come up and they are already rubbing the religious right's impotence into its face, confronting the bible-thumpers with probably having to swallow RudyMcRomney for '08.

Its almost enough to start feeling sorry for them.

"Politics is the shadow cast by business over society." John Dewey wasn't stupid.

David Kuo's recent book supports your notions here, nimh. The alliance between the traditional interests within the Republican party and the christian right has worked out to be, in Kuo's experience, much better for those traditional interests than for the RR. Apparently, some significant proportion of us are born with an innate passion and drive to be pawns.

But this is a big and complicated bit of american history. Lots of good stuff yet to be written on all of this.

Not sure if you are familiar with this reporter. He's one of the best around presently. The portion I've noted in red points to the period when key figures in the evangelical movement aligned with the RNC and the interests more traditionally associated with that party. Some of this was out in the open, but some of it has to be teased apart through association ties and various obscure sources. Lola has dug into this stuff with a fair thoroughness and gusto.

What I've concluded is that this movement has had considerable power in the US due to a number of historical reasons and more recently, due to this alignment which Dionne and Lola speak about. Brock's The Republican Noise Machine has valuable information on that too. Where Lola and I might disagree (perhaps even loudly in the privacy of our own home) is on the relative power of this group contrasted with other elements of the Republican constituency. But it is quite certain that Republican dominance over the last quarter century or so has come as a direct consequence of the evangelical shoulder to the wheel. It is also quite unarguable that the US has moved considerably to the right in roughly the same time frame and it would be inaccurate to hold the evangelical community (I'm uncomfortable with this generalization, but we need some rough way of speaking about this) has gained nothing or little through this period. But it is also certainly true to make the case that what they have gained in either cultural shift or in power has been far from what they would desire and a great distance from theocracy.

Christians Who Won't Toe the Line
By E. J. Dionne Jr.
Friday, March 16, 2007; Page A21

Evangelical Protestantism in the United States is going through a New Reformation that is disentangling a great religious movement from a partisan political machine. This historic change will require liberals and conservatives alike to abandon their sometimes narrow views of who evangelicals are.

The reformers won an important victory this month when the board of the National Association of Evangelicals faced down right-wing partisans and reaffirmed its view that solving global warming was an important moral cause. In so doing, it also expressed confidence in the Rev. Rich Cizik, the NAE's vice president for governmental affairs.

Cizik, who combines opposition to abortion with a firm commitment to human rights, the poor and the environment, came under attack from a gang of ideologues who would freeze evangelicals on a political course set more than a quarter-century ago.

I had 867,710 new posts since my last visit, and since the pages here still load as if I'm on a dialup connection, I don't think I'll be seeing what everyone has been up to. A quick update from here:

Sue's father passed away one week ago today (not unexpected; he'd been suffering from bladder cancer for seven years). She's holding up as well as can be expected. Her mother went to the hospital the very next day -- as Sue was preparing to leave for Miami and her father's funeral -- with congestive heart failure and pneumonia and remains there. Her dementia is end-stage, so her passing wouldn't be a terrible shock, either. Sue's sister, undergoing her own chemotherapy for lymphoma (in remission, just a booster) collapsed in the ICU, was transported a few steps over to ER and diagnosed with dehydration and a fever. She went home the same day.

Been kind of a rough week, and it looks like it's improving already, thank the <a href="http://www.venganza.org/">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a>.

How's your health these days?

While that's literally true, it's also a bit misleading because justices Roberts and Altio aren't "pols". True, the conservative faction on the Supreme Court is still one vote short of sacking Roe v. Wade and Lawrence v. Texas, but one vote short is progress from their perspective, which I think you underestimated.

It's nice to have an ally about the overhyping though.

No, it isn't. An educational setting presents some unique problems in respect to speech and other rights. Most acutely an educational setting prior to university. We probably ought not to allow freedom of choice in curricula, for example. And probably it would be imprudent to establish school hours through a democratic student vote.

On the other hand, where we don't make the distinction between education and indoctrination, we are at risk of setting up our schools to forward and enforce univestigated and arbitrary cultural assumptions/values, goals often (if not always) quite at odds with the goals related to encouraging students to question authority.

The SC got this case because of these dilemmas. But Lithwick's take on the relative dangers of either choice is mine as well. If we are to err, we ought to err in the direction of individual liberty.

I see you haven't read the transcript. Your loss; it's fun! If you should change your mind, as I hope you will, <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_06_278/argument/">you can find it here</a>.

What do you think of the following line-drawing? Under the First Amendment, students have a right to free speech at school events. But schools can bar from their events demonstrations that promote law-breaking. I think this would be a Salomonic solution that solves the problem in a straightforward, content-neutral way. It denies schools a limitless power to define their educational mission and suppress student speech contradicting it. At the same time, the compromise would still protect against excesses. For example, students could, at school events, unfold banners saying: "Legalize Marijuana", but not "Smoke pot, it's fun!".

When students express themselves in slang or otherwise obscurely, someone may need to interpret which category their messages belong into. That's what the teacher did in this case with "Bong hits 4 Jesus". And I think she was the right person to do this. The federal courts don't exist to micromanage school discipline. So in cases of ambiguity, they should defer to the teachers' interpretation as long as it's reasonable. (As I understand it, that was Kenneth Starr's whole point about "the frontline message interpreter".)

Together, this package makes for a clear legal rule that students and teachers can easily understand and follow. I find it very attractive. Conspicuously however, Ms. Litwick doesn't mention the possibility of this compromise with even one word. Why? I can't help but speculate it's because Scalia suggested the rule, and Starr seemed happy with it, contradicting Litwick's storyline.

In the original, oral arguments are wittier, more differentiated, much more entertaining, and not too much longer than the editorials about them. Read more oral arguments in the original! Or in the spirit of the case: Oral arguments hit 4 Jesus!

Giuliani comes out against civil unions Michael Roston
Published: Thursday April 26, 2007

The political website of the New York Sun will report tomorrow that in a major reversal from an earlier position, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani now opposes civil unions between same sex partners.

An advance copy of an article sent to RAW STORY shows that the New York Republican has backed off his earlier support for civil unions, prompted by the passage of a law in New Hampshire's State Senate.

"In this specific case the law states same sex civil unions are the equivalent of marriage and recognizes same sex unions from outside states. This goes too far and Mayor Giuliani does not support it," the Giuliani campaign said in a written response sent to the Sun's Ryan Sager.

The Sun notes that Giuliani had said in 2004 on Fox News, "I'm in favor of...civil unions."

FCC Republicans again attempt to weaken media ownership rule
</headline>
<post author="blatham" datetime="2007-11-10T10:10:00" id="p1">
Kevin Martin, chair of the FCC, is now moving to implement a plan for weakening media ownership rules which, when Powell attempted it two or three years ago, created enough of a loud and bipartisan public outcry such that the plan was dropped, or more correctly, pushed out of sight for a while. He has now said he wants to get this done by this December.

This is a very important issue and I encourage everyone to make a lot of noise about it.

Who is Kevin Martin?

<quote>
Controversy
In October 2007, Chairman Martin proposed an advanced timetable for amending FCC regulations on media consolidation. Like his predecessor, Micheal Powell, Martin's plan is controversial because it "relaxes the decades-old media ownership rules, including repealing a rule that forbids a company to own both a newspaper and a television or radio station in the same city."[5] The plan has also raised eyebrows because of the speed with which Martin wants to enact his proposals and the lack of opportunities for accepting public and Congressional input on the matter.

[edit]Background
Martin, a Republican born in Charlotte, N.C., was selected March 16, 2005, by President Bush as FCC Chairman to replace Michael Powell, who announced in January 2005 that he was leaving the top post. "Because he already is a member of the FCC, Martin's promotion, which had been widely expected, does not need to be confirmed by the Senate." [6]

"Kevin Martin, was one of the first national Bush-Cheney people to arrive in Miami from Washington, on Nov. 8, 2000. He had been a deputy general counsel for the Bush campaign and before that worked for Ken Starr, the independent counsel in the Monica Lewinsky affair." [7] [8]

Martin previously worked in the Office of the Independent Counsel, at the law and lobby firm Wiley, Rein, &amp; Fielding, and advised former FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth. [9]

Martin is married to Cathie Martin, former communications director for Vice President Dick Cheney and currently a member of President George W. Bush's communications staff. [10]

Bernie, the following is all i could find pertaining to the FCC - and the Washington affiliation. Senator Boxer will undoubtably be vocal if and when new FCC regulations are presented.

FCC to Review Media Study
Ron Orol
The Deal
September 18, 2006

Provided by The Deal
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin will review a contentious media ownership study that a former agency lawyer had said was destroyed.

Martin said he and his staff were unaware of the study, which suggested that looser limits on media mergers would hurt local television news coverage, according to a letter he sent late Thursday to Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.

But he added that it brought up matters relevant to the commission's media ownership proceeding, which began in July, and he planned to include the study in the agency's body of data that will be reviewed.

"I was not chairman at the time that this report was drafted," Martin wrote in a letter to Boxer released late Thursday. "I had not seen, nor was I aware of this draft report before you brought it to my attention. No one on my staff had seen this report nor were they aware of it."

A former lawyer from the FCC's media bureau, Adam Candeub, said the agency ordered its staff to destroy all copies of the draft study written in 2004. Boxer released the study during Martin's Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.

Candeub, now a law professor at Michigan State University, said senior management at the agency ordered the report destroyed.

In July, Martin launched the agency's third attempt to craft media merger regulations. The new round of regulatory initiatives followed a 2003 effort completed by Martin's predecessor, Michael Powell, permitting more media consolidation.

Harold Feld, director of Washington-based public interest law firm Media Access Project, said Powell apparently sought only to produce studies that complemented his plan for media ownership rules.

"It appears that it was Michael Powell, not the public, who preferred to make decisions based on 'personal ideology,'" Feld said in a statement.

In 2004, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia rejected the agency's new criteria and ordered the commission to produce new media rules.

Martin is expected to try to eliminate the prohibition on one company owning a television station and the major newspaper in a particular market.

His letter responds to one Boxer sent him on Wednesday expressing dismay "that this report, which was done at taxpayer expense more than two years ago, and which concluded that localism is beneficial to the public, was shoved in a drawer."

Two economists in the FCC's media bureau conducted the study, "Do local owners deliver more localism?"

It analyzed a database of news stories broadcast in 1998. It showed that local ownership of television stations added almost 5-1/2 minutes of total news to broadcasts and more than three minutes of "on-location" news.

The FCC's media ownership rules are intended to protect diversity of local opinions available to consumers.

A study demonstrating that consolidation reduces the amount of local news available to consumers would make it difficult for Martin to proceed with plans to ease restrictions on media mergers.

Martin is expected to argue that consumers have access to more local news and information through the Internet and new community newspapers than they did even in 2003, the last time the agency considered changes to the media rules.

The media cartel should be broken up as this same cartel is skewing public opinion with biased polls and reports. This media cartel is responsible for Darth War_dodger's Presidential election thefts. Of course, it is the Democratic mole Bill Clinton that enabled the media cartel to be born by allowing business mergers.

"But for media deals in the future, it is unclear whether the new rules will make it significantly easier for conglomerates to own both a newspaper and a station in most markets."

Most Markets???

and

"In announcing his plan, Mr. Martin said he sought to strike a compromise that would assist what he said was a financially ailing newspaper industry while trying to be sensitive to concerns about the effects of media consolidation on the quality of news coverage."

Bad reviews pile up for FCC chief's plan

Martin wants to loosen ownership rules and end debate within weeks. Lawmakers, activists and industry object.

WASHINGTON -- The last time federal regulators tried to change the rules on how many media outlets companies could own, the effort bombed like a bad movie. The sequel appears to be headed for the same fate.

BILL MOYERS: Last year, Haley Barbour was awarded GOVERNING magazine's "Public Official of the Year" for his stewardship of Mississippi in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. And last week, he easily won re-election for a second term and is now being talked up as the Republicans' vice presidential nominee next year.

Monday, September 18, 2006

Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) wrote to FCC Chairman Kevin Martin bringing to light a second report on media ownership that seems to have been suppressed by the FCC.
Following is Senator Boxer's letter to Chairman Martin:

September 18, 2006

Chairman Kevin J. Martin
Federal Communications Commission
445 12th Street SW
Washington, DC 20554

Dear Chairman Martin,
Since I last wrote to you, another draft FCC report that was never made public has come to my attention.

I have now received a copy of the Commission's draft 2003 "Review of the Radio Industry." The report found, among other things, that while there was a 5.9 percent increase in the number of radio stations in the country between March 1996 and March 2003, there was a 35 percent decrease in the number of radio owners. The report also found that Clear Channel Communications, the largest radio group owner, went from owning 62 stations in 1996, to 1,233 in 2003.

For reasons I do not understand, this report was never finalized even though the FCC had released similar reports in 2002, September 2001, January 2001, and 1998. Moreover, the Commission has not released a "Review of the Radio Industry" report since 2002. This is in spite of the fact that this information would be highly relevant to the Commission's ongoing proceedings on localism and media ownership.

Recently, it was reported in Radio and Records that Clear Channel had visited two Commissioners' offices on August 31, 2006 "to influence their positions on expanding ownership cap limits in the largest radio markets."

I trust that you will update and release this report prior to the conclusion of the media ownership proceeding so that the Commission will be able to make its decision based on the most current industry data.

Chairman Martin, this is the second report in a week that I have received that appears to have been shelved by officials within the FCC and I am growing more and more concerned at these developments.

In light of this new discovery, I will ask the Inspector General of the FCC to thoroughly investigate not only the draft 2003 "Review of the Radio Industry" and the 2004 localism study, but also to examine whether it was then or is now the practice of the FCC to suppress facts that are contrary to a desired outcome. Although I understand that you were not Chairman at the time these documents were produced, I wanted to bring this new incident to your attention and urge your office's full cooperation with the Inspector General.

Sincerely,

Barbara Boxer
United States Senator

As my old friend snood suggests, even a cursory examination would reveal that my neuroses manifest themselves in splendorous array.

But this one sits up near the top. If one holds, as I do, that the 'enemy' is not either or any party but rather the ease with which communities can organize themselves under authoritarian control, then one tries to understand the mechanisms by which this may be (and has been) achieved. Information control is essential to the authoritarian enterprise. Authoritarian regimes always demand it and they cannot continue when they do not manage to control information.

The current ownership rules are an anachronism. They no longer reflect the current realities, principally of declining numbers of newspapers in American cities, and increasing numbers of TV and radio outlets. Prohibiting ownership in one city of both a newspaper and a broadcast outlet has become a silly relic of the past in an age of nationwide TV, cable and radio networks.

The real motivation for this issue is the commercial success of some conservatively oriented broadcast media in an otherwise liberal industry. What Democrats can't get or hold on to through persuasion they seek to keep through regulation.

Hello george. Word of your foolishness precedes you.

Two years ago, I saw a broadcast of an interview with Ted Turner, founder of CNN. I'm unsure of the date of recording. It was a fairly relaxed affair, he and his interviewer surrounded by perhaps a hundred or so in the audience. I've forgotten but it may have been a birthday or some such that interview marked. Turner talked quite openly about his life, his marriages, his successes and his disappointments. But he recounted one story which particularly caught my attention. He'd recently been in London visiting Tony Blair, a longtime friend. Turner said that he'd expressed to Blair his misgivings on the political power that Rupert Murdoch had managed to gain in Britain through, particularly, his media holdings there and Turner thought this a dangerous turn of events which Blair ought to do something to manage. Turner quoted Blair's response to this, "If it weren't for Rupert, I wouldn't be the Prime Minister."

Do you credit this account, george? Why? Do you think it unimportant? Why?

I would surmise that there are definite left leaning media such as NYT, Wash Post, L.A. Time etc, on the other hand I find local media (Denver/Albuquerque/Des Moines/Phoenix etc etc) etc that are more centrist/conservative. This appears to me to cover a broad range from radio to t.v. to print. Who reads/listens/watches what is somewhat a mystery to me but I imagine that I am the only house on my street that reads the NYT while all my neighbors read the Albuquerque Journal.
CNN/Fox News sucks no matter where you place it on the political political spectrum.

Martin has said the rule changes are small and would help bolster the financial health of the newspaper industry by allowing owners in the top markets to buy a TV or radio station.
If cross-ownership limits were eased or lifted, it could help some investors, such as real estate tycoon Sam Zell, who is leading a proposed leveraged buy-out of media group Tribune Co.
Zell already has asked the FCC to reaffirm waivers that allow Tribune to own daily newspapers and broadcast outlets in some markets. The timing of the FCC's decision could be important, since Tribune has said it expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter.
Martin's proposal also could nullify any ownership concerns raised by News Corp's proposed buyout of Wall Street Journal owner Dow Jones &amp; Co. News Corp owns the New York Post newspaper and local stations in New York.

No. When you touch a sensitive spot, I can be counted on to tell you that your eyes are like languid puddles.

Now, if you are going to bother responding here, do so with some order and integrity, please. Let's start here. First, are you suggesting then that such a conversation never took place or that Turner is lying? On what basis? Do you suppose, for example, that they are not friends at all?

As is well known Bernie it is bread and circuses and as we have bread trying to burst the epidermis it is now just circuses and Mr Murdoch has by far the best circus with his Sky channels.

Thus those of us who are not intent on making a name for ourselves are in favour of him appointing Prime Ministers and we now have one who he didn't appoint and to nobody's surprise is sinking in the ratings daily. It may well be frowned upon in more eleveted circles but there you go.

Blatham,
I have no opinion one way or the other concerning the conversation you reported, it contents or the veracity of the players in it. However the implied criticism of Rupert Murdoch (one of your favorite targets here) coming from the mouth of Ted Turner- and on the subject of media empires - was more amusingly hypocritical than I could quietly endure.

You've failed to engage any fundamental point here. What you have done is toss up an ad hominem to avoid address.

Not at all: your prejudice and blindness is showing.

What fundamental point did you raise???? I suppose it is that Rupert Murdoch leads an evil corporatist conspiracy to influuence the Western World. Did it occur to you at all that using the story of Ted Turner's recollection of a supposed conversation with Blair concerning Murdoch would make your point anywhere near as effectively as it very loudly broadcast your own prejudice and hypocrisy on the subject?????

Go back and re-read perhaps. But let's make it easier. I've made several but let's take two.

First, the tale told by Turner regarding the conversation with Blair. I see no reason why I should discount the story and lots of reasons why I might find it quite truthful. However one might try and sort out the credibility of the story, the magnitude of the claim made is such that attention is clearly due.

Second, I've noted the clearly partisan nature of the FCC chair's prior positions and activities.

When I was a lad just three-foot-three
Certain questions occurred to me,
So I asked me father quite seriously
To tell me the story 'bout the bird and bee.
He stammered and he stuttered pathetically
And this is what he said to me.

He said, "The woman piaba and the man piaba
and the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass,
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm,
And the famous grandy scratch scratch.

It was clear as mud but it covered the ground
And the confusion made the brain go 'round.
I went and ask a good friend of mine,
Known to the world as Albert Einstein.
He said "Son, from the beginning of time and creativity
There existed the force of relativity
Pi r square and minus ten is rooted only when
The solar system in one light year
Make the Hayden planetarium disappear
So if Mt Everest doesn't move
I am positive that it will prove

That the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass,
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm,
And the famous grandy scratch scratch.

It was clear as mud but it covered the ground
And the confusion made the brain go 'round.
I grabbed a boat and went abroad
In Baden Baden asked Sigmund Freud
He said "Son, from your sad face remove the grouch
Put the body down up on the couch
I can see from your frustration a neurotic sublimation
Hey love and hate is psychosomatic
Your Rorsach shows that you're a peri patatic
It all started with a broken sibling
In the words of the famous Herr Jacoplin

That the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass,
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm,
And the famous grandy scratch scratch.

Well I traveled far and I traveled wide
And I don't even have me self a bride
All the great men upon this earth
Have confused me since my birth
I've been over land and been over sea
Trying to find answer 'bout the bird and bee
But now that I am ninety three
I don't give a darn you see

If the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass,
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm,
And the famous grandy scratch scratch.

I have no opinion concerning the veracity of the quote. However I do know that Ted Turner himself has invested heavily in and created media enterprises and used them to advance his own political views. I found it rather odd that anyone would use him to vocalize the same accusation against Murdoch. More than a hint of blatant hypocrisy there - a laughable case of the liberal pot calling the conservative kettle black.

Second, there were many reasons for Blair's ascent to power. I believe his actions in inducing the British Labor Party to abandon its utterly discredited Trades union identity was the chief reason for his victory, and not the machinations of Rupert Murdoch. They may well have helped, but to ignore the other factors is simply to ignore history.

The current dispite within the FCC is quite partison on both sides. No one argues that the current rules aren't anachronistic - they harken back to an era in which there was intense competition in most U.S. cities between multiple newspapers and a wide open field for investment in the then new TV industry. Both sides of this question have changed in profound ways, and the need for reform is now clear. The struggle however to define precisely how the reform will take place is intense and thoroughly partisan on both sides. In generall I prefer less restrictive regulation of private activity to more. Your definition of partisan appears to be limited to things you oppose.

FCC To Vote On Ownership Rules Review
FCC To Vote On Ownership Rules Review

WASHINGTON -- November 20, 2007: The FCC is set to vote on at least part of its media-ownership rules at its next open meeting, set for Tuesday, November 27.

The just-released agenda for the meeting says the FCC will vote on a Report and Order in the 2006 quadrennial rules review and consider a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking "concerning initiatives designed to increase participation in the broadcasting industry by new entrants and small businesses, including minority- and women-owned businesses."

It's unclear what actions, if any, the agecny may take in the R&amp;O, and which rules will be subject to further consideration under the FNPRM.

Among the rules under review are the local radio ownership rules, which regulate how many stations one company can own in a market. Also on the table are the agency's radio-TV cross ownership and cross-media ownership rules.

FCC Chairman Kevin Martin last week released a proposal to eliminate the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership ban in the top 20 markets if certain conditions are met, with no changes to the radio ownership limit, the radio-TV cross-ownership rules, or the TV-duopoly rule, which are also under review.

That proposal was greeted with protests from Capitol Hill and FCC Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein, and the vote has been scheduled despite pleas from lawmakers to delay any rules changes until a separate localism proceeding has been completed -- and despite the introduction by Sen. Byron Dorgan of the Media Ownership Act of 2007, which would delay an FCC vote on new ownership rules until after it has held a new localism proceeding and considered the recommendations of a diversity task force.

Legislators oppose FCC cable plan
Legislators oppose FCC cable plan
Increased regulation would hurt consumers and innovation, a group of Republicans writes.
From Reuters
November 21, 2007

WASHINGTON -- A group of Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives raised objections Tuesday to a Federal Communications Commission proposal that could lead to tougher regulation of cable television operators.

A letter signed by 23 House Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee expressed serious doubts about the prospect of a regulatory crackdown on the cable industry, raised in a report that FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin has circulated among the agency's other commissioners.

"Such actions are unsupported by the record of significant competition in the video programming marketplace, and would be harmful to innovation and consumers," the lawmakers wrote.

The prospect of further cable regulation is contained in the latest annual report on video competition.

The report finds U.S. cable subscription levels have exceeded 70% where service is available, passing a threshold that would give the agency more authority over companies such as Comcast Corp. and Time Warner Cable Inc.

The study has met with resistance from Martin's fellow Republican FCC commissioners, Robert M. McDowell and Deborah Taylor Tate.

McDowell and Tate have raised doubts about how Martin arrived at the figure because it conflicts with findings in the same report in previous years.

McDowell said Monday that without further substantiation, he would not support the 70% finding in the video competition report.

The letter from House Republicans could make it more difficult for Martin to get the three votes that he needs to accept the report, one Capitol Hill source said.

The lawmakers' letter said Martin's proposed 70% finding was "suspect not only on legal grounds, but also on factual ones."

The Republican lawmakers also expressed opposition to any requirement that the industry adopt a system, supported by Martin, that would offer channels individually to customers on a so-called a la carte basis.

"Invasive program carriage obligations interfere with the ability of cable operators to package content," the Republican lawmakers said.

Agenda Includes Video-Competition Report, Media-Ownership Review (Minus Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership), Broadcaster Reporting Requirements

By John Eggerton -- Broadcasting &amp; Cable, 11/20/2007 4:43:00 PM
The Federal Communications Commission released the agenda for its Nov. 27 meeting, and it's loaded with media items.

As expected, chairman Kevin Martin scheduled a vote for a release of the video-competition report, which means that he either has the two Democratic commissioners lined up, since the Republicans expressed their concerns about an FCC finding that cable has met a deregulatory threshold, or he adjusted the item.

Republican commissioner Robert McDowell said Monday that he could vote to approve the report if the so-called 70/70 threshold part were deleted.

Commissioner Deborah Taylor Tate also expressed reservations about the data the FCC used to come up with its conclusion, as has the cable industry en masse, which said its subscriber counts and household penetration have actually gone down with competition from satellite-TV providers and telephone companies.

Others -- Media Access Project, most notably -- said, as MAP said in a letter to the FCC Tuesday, that the 70/70 test has been met and that powerful cable operators have "squeezed out independent minority and religious programming."

The commission is also scheduled to vote on the media-ownership review that has been ongoing for years, but not the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership part, since the chairman is accepting comments on that proposal through Dec. 11 and is expected to vote on that Dec. 18 unless Congress applies sufficient pressure to delay that timetable.

While the agenda does not spell out specifics, the item is described as "concerning initiatives designed to increase participation in the broadcasting industry by new entrants and small businesses, including minority- and women-owned businesses."

That is likely the chairman's proposal to allow designated entities, including minorities, women, and small businesses, to lease digital broadcast spectrum from TV stations as a way to give them a broadcast "voice" without the entry costs of buying or building a station.

Minority advocates and Hill and FCC Democrats have been underwhelmed by the proposal, with some picking up on the phrase popularized by FCC commissioner Jonathan Adelstein that it is akin to spectrum "sharecropping." But Martin likely has two other Republican votes for the plan.

The chairman has also scheduled a vote on his proposal to increase broadcaster reporting requirements to include more detailed accounts of their public service.

Also on the agenda is an item to cut cable leased-access rights, perhaps by as much as 75%.

I don't see much TV Bernie apart from sport, wherein important lessons are on offer, so I haven't seen HoC.

I see bits of things and I have seen a bit of it. I find that seeing bits of a lot of things that I don't choose helps trends to stand out more clearly and saves me from my allowing myself to get into too narrow a mindset.

HoC isn't the sort of thing that appeals to my sense of humour. No doubt it is very good. It got some decent reviews if I remember. The class it is aimed at are not entirely my favourite organism on the planet.

I have to live up to my reputation after all.

I prefer movies about lost dvds on which some of the personal details of 25 million of us are stored. Not mine I might add. Some of us like to see real ministers squirming in real time rather than some acted out fantasy of urbanity, superciliousness and command.

And there's Northern Rock, our first sub-prime victim, running in tandem. Watching the Police spend billions of pounds in a long running saga of overtime and equipment purchases. The personalities of those who bring it all to us. Health jitters. Double dealing. Traffic news. Baking cakes. It's brilliant.

Attempting to draw a literary picture of the next five minutes in the news gathering and presentation business would take a rather long time. You would need a Proust.

It's a bit like a love of cricket. First you have to will yourself to watch it. Too many people love this game for me to dismiss it. So you watch it and the interrelationship between will and imagination, which de Sade is supposed to have discovered, is agitated. The will sets the imagination off and then the imagination takes over. Plenty of beer helps or possibly some other stimulent. Once you get the love of cricket you can sometimes wonder what it's like to be without it. It sort of grasses up (stool pigeon) men working at the top of whatever game they might be playing. Out in the open. 20 cameras. Nothing missed unless it's a girl running across the pitch and hurdling the stumps with no clothes on. They do avert their gaze, our gaze actually, on such occasions, presumably because they think we might be corrupted by seeing what would have been a common sight in the golden age of village cricket. Can you imagine that?

It takes will power to inhibit the will. Which is a bit of a conundrum really. But once the imagination has taken over it becomes habitual and the will drops out altogether. Sadism, freed from its popular usages, can be described as pleasure derived from the activity of the will. It can be constructive or destructive. In fact de Sade recommended the encouragement of constructive sadism in order defuse the destructive aspects.

Watch television Bernie-- not the programmes.

My brothers and I, and most of our friends, have been pretty seriously into an array of sports from childhood and up to now, or just short of now. Kayaking and skiing became my two great loves. A couple of months past, my twin and some old friends joined us for a weekend at the ocean and we all brought our baseball gear. As we were chucking a ball back and forth on the beach, a couple of the wives overheard some 30somethings declare, "Well, look at those elderly gentlemen playing. Isn't that the sweetest thing?" As to watching sports, don't do it very much. I came to detest hockey for the psychotic violence in it. World cup season is my real treat.

As to tv and film, artists, very good artists, find their way into any medium or art form that has compatriots and which might turn a dollar. I'm a fan of beauty and intelligence wherever it turns up. Compilations of award winning advertisements, for example.

It's watching the foolish young men confounding the basic evolutionary principles which Cervantes delineated oh so long ago which is the interesting thing for educated men as mature and shagged out as wot me and you is.

George might make the claim that demands for deregulation are attributable to changes in the media environment. But demands for deregulation are ubiquitous across industries as a consequence of ideology.

I don't think that was georgeob1 's point, but even if it were, so what? Even if we are hearing the same arguments from the media tycoons today that we heard when deregulation may have, in fact, been a bad idea for precisely the reasons that you've stated, that doesn't mean that those arguments are flawed now. I certainly don't adhere to the notion of "once wrong, always wrong," and I'm not quite sure why you would.

Chicago has had cross-ownership for years, with the Tribune Company owning both the Tribune newspaper and WGN-TV and radio. In addition, for many years the same company that owned the Sun-Times owned WFLD-TV. Despite that cross-ownership, there was no dearth of competing viewpoints on either television or radio: there are over a dozen television stations in and around Chicago, and more than twice that number of radio stations. I have yet to see a convincing argument that the Tribune "monopoly" has had any negative effect on Chicago media.

Even in a small, one-newspaper city, cross-ownership would have very little influence on the media consumer. Rather, we should expect that the greatest impact would be felt by advertisers. Butte, Montana, for instance, has one daily newspaper, three television stations, and seven radio stations. Even if the newspaper cross-owned a tv station and a radio station, there would still be competing editorial voices, not just from local media but from national newspapers, cable and satellite television, magazines, and the internet. The average Butte citizen probably wouldn't even notice.

There's nothing necessarily wrong or incorrect arising from a partisan viewpoint. Perhaps you have another word/notion in mind? I suspect george does. Further, I suspect he could speak for a while on how the 'liberal partisan position' is extremist or unbalanced or terror-fraught or some such. And yet I also suspect he would have some trouble filling out the other side of the scale...what the 'conservative partisan postion' gets wrong.

And then there's those outlier bits to this 'partisan' argument, like Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins, Trent Lott, Bill Saphire and others who are opposed to such deregulation.

You mention the case of the Tribune Company. You suggest that no notable problems have arisen in this case. Ought we to conclude that other cities must follow this example?

And let's lift it all up a notch. Is there any need for any regulation at all as regards media ownership?

While further posts from me may be pointless, given that Blatham has already described what George would say on this matter, let me briefly outline my basic thoughts.

Federal regulation of private actions is justifiable in certain circumstances to prevent grevious harm or injury to individuals or groups of people. In addition in certain circumstances preventive Federal regulation is justified to protect the public good in preventing gross distortion of markets or other processes on which the public depends and for which no other means are available. (Here the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission is a good example).

In general government regulation is recognized by our constitution as a generally undesirable thing, allowable only under certain circumstances and in support only of specifically named powers of government. It is explicitly excluded in numerous areas of life (notably including freedom of speech) as part of that same constitution. This is of course based on the principle that government processes too readily lend themselves to abuse through corruption, usurpation and the persistent venality of human nature when the power of government is in its hands.

The so-called fairness doctrine in broadcast communications was a direct result of the now obselete practical necessity of a government monopoly on access to instant mass communications, then available only through the broadcast frequency spectrum -- in past years with this the only instant means of wide area communication, chaos would surely result without such government control of access. Once government became the gate keeper, it became necessary to ensure that this power was exercised with impartiality and fairness. The fairness doctrine was initiated chiefly as a limitation on the government's actions in licensing broadcasters and preventing it from intentionally or merely inadvertantly allowing existing printy and other media entities from dominating the broadcast spectrum merely by virtue of their presence in the market.

Now, in an age of vastly improved signal density in the broadcast spectrum and of ubiquitous cable and internet networks that don't use the broadcast spectrum at all, the situation is entirely different. There is no longer a local shortage of broadcast spectral access, and equally effective alternate means of instantly accessing the same audience through the internet and cable networks that are quite beyond this regulatory regime are readily available to all. The justification for the regulatory regime and the attendant evils it permits, including particularly the inherent limitation of the freedom of speech it entails, no longer exists.

These are the arguments that were correctly used some years ago to eliminate the so-called "Fairness Doctrine" limiting public speech on the airways. Note that the issue before us now is the elimination of other equally obsolete and no longer justifiable government restrictions on the free enterprise of media companies and their owners. Given the fact that these rules apply only to a small part of mass media - those using the broadcast spectrum - the absurdity of the "fairness" arguments being offered in support of the return of these now obsolete, no longer justifiable restrictions on freedom of speech is obvious for all to see.

All of this leads the discerning observer to look deeper for the real motives behind this issue.

We have all seen Blatham's bland acceptance of the Turner Broadcasting empire or those of the Washington Post Co. or even the New York Times -- and the stark contrast with his fear of evil conspiracy behind the otherwise similar empire headed by Rupert Murdoch. I hesitate to suggest that the persistent success of Rush Limbach and lesser lights like Michael Savage in attracting and retaining a wide audience on radio stations owned by Clear Channel Communications, the Sinclair network and others may be behind this rather obvious attempt to silence a political voice he happens to dislike. However the evidence in this case is rather clear. This is an attempt to misuse the power of government to suppress the political speech of voices they oppose. It is all done with high-sounding rhetoric and vague appeals to virtue, but the motives and the goals are hardly different from those of the brownshirts who proceded them in this kind of forced suppression of disagreement.

But this one sits up near the top. If one holds, as I do, that the 'enemy' is not either or any party but rather the ease with which communities can organize themselves under authoritarian control, then one tries to understand the mechanisms by which this may be (and has been) achieved.

Makes sense except that you delude yourself if you truly assert that you do not see the Republican Party as the 'enemy.' As a reader of most of your posts, I assure you that with a little time and effort I can find enough blatham quotes on A2K to prove otherwise.

Information control is essential to the authoritarian enterprise. Authoritarian regimes always demand it and they cannot continue when they do not manage to control information.

I agree completely, however I'm afraid that your vision is myopic. You continuously display the sense that authoritarianism can only equal The Right.

I have no opinion whatever concerning the motives of most of the individuals involved in this debate. There are numerous central and side elements of the issue on which various actors can hang their hats.

However, in a world in which mass communications is increasingly dominated by the completely unregulated internet and cable networks, the attempt to single out a relatively small segment of broadcast networks for government regulation of both content and ownership, strikes me as absurd. The anti monopoly and fairness arguments offered in support of it are utterly enviscerated by the simple facts that the most ubiquitous mass communications networks are utterly unregulated by the FCC, and that the one segment they are attempting to restrain, broadcast networks, happens to be a favored venue of their political opponents.

Finally, the physical facts on which the constitutional justification of the former regulatory regime was based no longer exist in a world of HD radio, the internet, and cable radio &amp; TV. There is no longer any justification for this limitation on constitutionally guaranteed freedoms.

I have made my position clear. Perhaps Blatham would care to enlighten us with an explanation of just what is the logical basis for his advocacy of this continued infringement on individual freedom.

The simple fact that he will argue with you and not with me is because he can bounce off your arguments to the advantage of the left.

Bernie, you are merely being clever and cute - while you evade the very issue you have raised.

You are unable to defend the proposition that the government should regulate both content and ownership of broadcast media while, at the same time, exercising neither power with respect to cable networks and the internet. You are equally unable to defend the obvious absence of any justification for the abridgement of free speech you advocate.

So instead you indulge yourself in these cute evasions. I believe they speak very eloquently for the indefensability of your position - whatever it might be.

As an eternal optimist, I admit that I will be able to find a silver lining in the dark cloud of a Democratic win in 2008: We will have an opportunity to see if the numerous unbiased defenders of Truth, Justice and The Global Way find it as easy to criticize an American government led by Democrats as they do one led by Republicans.

Comparing the current US administration to the former USSR and the current China is pretty ridiculous and herein lies my complaint with your rhetoric.

It is a good thing to have the choice of either Corn Flakes or Oregano Sugar Stars for breakfast and to be able to purchase them at a relatively low price as set by open competition. But I don't think we'd want to say that meaningful democracy is dependent upon that situation. It is dependent upon a free and independent and varied media spectrum and upon the fact of a multiplicity of political viewpoints expressed and received/considered however.

George is right about a couple of things here and I suppose we ought to validate them because a thing is as valuable as it is rare. The media environment is different than when earlier legislation/regulations were devised, and the devil is in the details which can be complicated. For example, in this case, Moyers makes the claim that this proposed legislation contains a loophole which will permit consolidation far past what Martin suggests. I can't forward his argument or the reasons for it because I don't know what he's referring to nor whether his view is accurate. But I consider it likely to the point of certainty that Martin, as a typical Bush administration political appointee, is in his position to forward industry interests, citizen interests being mostly impedimentary. Powell, Martin's predecessor, is now making the big dollars working for the media industry. He ain't a consumer advocate.

I didn't compare them. It is an 'if X, then Y' argument using a real example to demonstrate the connection. If media control is effectively narrowed down in the direction of a single control point, to that degree liberty will be diminished. All authoritarian systems function this way and where information is so controlled (remember, it isn't on/off or black/white, it is degrees) there you have an authoritarian system. Five corporations now own the major media in the US. Would you wish it to consolidate down to three or two or one? Why not?

Still, we should welcome Martin's attempt to frame his push for new media ownership rules in the language of democracy. He tells us, "Newspapers are crucial to our democracy." Indeed. The regulation banning a media company from owning a newspaper and a broadcast operation in the same community was designed to promote a diversity of voices in the local community. A rule that says a local television operation cannot be owned by the local newspaper is perfectly consistent with the long-held view that the robust expression of diverse and independent views is essential to democracy.

Honesty from public leaders is also crucial to our democracy. It would have been nice if Martin trusted the public with the news that he was under pressure to change the rule from billionaires Samuel Zell and Rupert Murdoch. Zell is a Chicago real estate investor who wants to complete his buyout of the Tribune Company before the end of 2007. I recommend the documentary "Outfoxed" for a detailed primer on Murdoch, the new publisher of the Wall Street Journal.

There are those who argue that the sky will not fall if Martin and his Republican colleagues at the FCC vote to eliminate the ban on broadcast/newspaper cross-ownership in the 20 largest cities. Even if, as FCC Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein note, this amounts to 43 percent of the nation's households, the Martin proposal does not for some, such as Zell and the Tribune company, go quite far enough.

Besides, as the Columbia Journalism Review acknowledges, Tribune and News Corporation and the New York Times have been operating with special waivers from this law for decades.

So its just determined corrections of journalistic error?

I really don't like Crowley but the following piece is amazing in how far he is willing to go - while all the while making excuses and suggesting the sins are really virtues. Emphasis is added.

Bunker Hillary
Clinton's strategy for crushing the media.

Michael Crowley, The New Republic Published: Monday, November 12, 2007

On June 1, The New York Times published a front-page article titled, ONE PLACE WHERE OBAMA GOES ELBOW TO ELBOW. The feature detailed Barack Obama's love for pickup basketball, his jersey-tugging style, even the time he hit a long game-winning shot after getting fouled.

The Obama camp clearly welcomed the humanizing glimpse at Obama's life; his rivals, probably not so much. In an ordinary campaign, that might have been it. But this is no ordinary campaign--not when Hillary Clinton is a candidate. And so, the Clinton team let Times reporter Patrick Healy, who covers the Hillary beat, know about their "annoyance" with the story, as Healy later put it.

If grumbling about a basketball story seems excessive, it's also typical of the Clinton media machine. Reporters who have covered the hyper-vigilant campaign say that no detail or editorial spin is too minor to draw a rebuke. Even seasoned political journalists describe reporting on Hillary as a torturous experience. Though few dare offer specifics for the record--"They're too smart," one furtively confides. "They'll figure out who I am"-- (And do what? No, this doesn't signify intimidation as these seasoned journalists are only worried that they might be stricken from the Clinton Christmas Card List) privately, they recount excruciating battles to secure basic facts. Innocent queries are met with deep suspicion. Only surgically precise questioning yields relevant answers. Hillary's aides don't hesitate to use access as a blunt instrument, as when they killed off a negative GQ story on the campaign by threatening to stop cooperating with a separate Bill Clinton story the magazine had in the works. Reporters' jabs and errors are long remembered, and no hour is too odd for an angry phone call. Clinton aides are especially swift to bypass reporters and complain to top editors. "They're frightening!" says one reporter who has covered Clinton. "They don't see [reporting] as a healthy part of the process. They view this as a ruthless kill-or-be-killed game."

Despite all the grumbling, however, the press has showered Hillary with strikingly positive coverage. "It's one of the few times I've seen journalists respect someone for beating the hell out of them," says a veteran Democratic media operative. The media has paved a smooth road for signature campaign moments like Hillary's campaign launch and her health care plan rollout and has dutifully advanced campaign-promoted themes like Hillary's "experience" and expertise in military affairs. This is all the more striking in light of the press's past treatment of Clinton--particularly during her husband's White House years--including endless stories about her personal ethics, frostiness, and alleged Lady Macbeth persona.

It's enough to make you suspect that breeding fear and paranoia within the press corps is itself part of the Clinton campaign's strategy. And, if that sounds familiar, it may be because the Clinton machine, say reporters and pro-Hillary Democrats, is emulating nothing less than the model of the Bush White House, which has treated the press with thinly veiled contempt and minimal cooperation. "The Bush administration changed the rules," as one scribe puts it--and the Clintonites like the way they look. ( To be sure, no one accuses the Clinton team of outright lying to the press, as the Bushies have done, or of crossing other ethical lines. (No one?) And reporters say other press shops--notably those of Rudy Giuliani and John Edwards--are also highly combative.)

So far, the strategy has worked brilliantly. (Whereas when ployed by the "Bushies" it was manipulation, intimidation and despicable) In the current climate, where the mainstream media is under attack from both conservatives and liberals, Clinton may have picked the right moment to get tough with the press. But, as the murmur of discontent among the fourth estate grows--and Hillary's coverage has taken a sharper tone since a widely panned debate performance late last month--even some Hillary supporters fear that the strategy may produce a dangerous backlash.

In January 1993, Hillary Clinton granted her first newspaper interview as First Lady. But, rather than agreeing to sit down with a national reporter to discuss issues of substance, Hillary would only meet with a food reporter from The New York Times--and then only to discuss her hostess duties. Later, other reporters who wanted to question her about policy were told to submit written questions. "Her ground-zero assumption is that [a reporter is] an asshole," a senior Hillary aide told her biographer, Carl Bernstein.

Clinton's wariness was forged by her husband's nightmarish experience on the 1992 campaign trail. Battered by stories about Bill's mistresses and financial dealings, Hillary seethed at the press and resolved to control their coverage. Bill disliked the press, too--but not with the loathing of his wife, who even tried to throw the press out of the White House itself. In January 1993, she and her friend Susan Thomases proposed to move the White House press room next door, to the sleepy Old Executive Office Building. When that scheme was deemed untenable, aides closed off a hallway connecting the press room to the West Wing. Outraged reporters pounced on press secretary George Stephanopoulos, who later recalled thinking, "I'm not your problem; Hillary is.... [Bill] Clinton seems to be on my side. He asked me again this morning why we were closing the door. Um, have you talked to your wife about this, Mr. President?"

Hillary's first instinct was usually to stonewall the press. When New York Times reporter Jeff Gerth was first reporting on Whitewater in early 1992, rather than work with Gerth, Hillary insisted on giving him the figurative finger. Likewise, Hillary balked when The Washington Post asked to see private Whitewater documents in 1993. Bill Clinton favored compliance with the Post--but was overruled by Hillary, who implied she would rather "throw them all in the Potomac." Former Clinton White House adviser David Gergen has called the decision "the decisive turning point" that convinced Washington the Clintons had something to hide.

To be fair, when Hillary did engage the press, she often got burned. When she ruminated to the The New York Times Magazine's Michael Kelly about spirituality, he produced a mocking cover story titled "Saint Hillary." Hillary later wrote that she had been "raw with grief" over her dying father, implying that Kelly had exploited her emotional vulnerability. In 1994, with questions swirling about a big profit she turned selling cattle futures, she agreed to meet with a clamoring media. Donning a memorable pink suit, she endured an hour of harsh questioning. Afterward, according to Gerth and Don Van Natta's recent book Her Way, Hillary told her aides the exercise had been futile. "They're not going to let up. They're just going to keep coming at us, no matter what we do." The sordid Monica Lewinsky scandal only affirmed Hillary's firm belief that the "vast right-wing conspiracy" had immense power over mainstream media coverage.

When Hillary embarked on her 2000 run for Senate in New York, she brought her antipathy toward the press with her and set new standards for media control. After the campaign, AP reporter Beth Harpaz wrote a book about her experience in which she described feeling at various times "humiliated," "paranoid," and "so worn down and so exasperated by the lack of access and the lack of news in this campaign that I'd given up fighting." Once, when Hillary sent a candy basket to the press van, the downtrodden reporters were incredulous, Harpaz wrote: "[N]one of us could believe that Hillary was being so nice to us."

In July, Hillary's communications director, Howard Wolfson, appeared on MSNBC's "Hardball" with Barack Obama's chief strategist David Axelrod. Obama had said he would be willing to meet with Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Wolfson pointedly noted that this would place Obama in the company of a "Holocaust denier," which compelled a flummoxed Axelrod to clarify that Obama does not, in fact, condone Holocaust denial. The show's host, Chris Matthews, declared Wolfson's tactic "brilliant politics" before later rebranding it "dirtball."

Many political reporters feel similarly conflicted about Wolfson, the public face of Hillary's press operation. But everyone agrees he is a fearsome operator. As communications director for the 1998 Senate campaign of New York Democrat Charles Schumer, Wolfson would fire up his aides by riffing on a famous line from The Untouchables: "If he uses a fist, you use a bat. If he uses a knife, you use a gun." During Hillary's 2006 reelection campaign, he constantly taunted her GOP opponent, John Spencer, for once joking that he'd like to kill a federal judge and a governor with whom he'd feuded.

Those flashes of sadism don't reflect the unexpectedly likeable character within, however. "Wooffie," as Hillary has been known to call him, is colorfully eccentric--afraid of flying, highly allergic, prone to weird accidents, and a proud indie-rock connoisseur. (As opposed to his counterparts in the GOP who are scarily paranoid ---afraid of gays, suspiciously immune to allergies, designers of weird accidents, and proud members of the Eugene McCarthy Fan Club.) And, unlike many hard-assed Republican operatives, Wolfson socializes with some top D.C. political reporters. (Ooooh - that makes it alright then)

A former reporter himself, Wolfson may actually feel some kinship with the reporters he spins. Not so other senior members of Hillary's team, including her chief pollster and guru, Mark Penn, whose recent book Microtrends derides media "elites" as out of touch and superficial. (Penn even name-checks The New York Times's Mark Leibovich for "filling front pages with personal impressions about candidates' personalities.") Moreover, working under Wolfson is a press team drawn from the killing fields of New York political media, where relentless tabloids drive the news and slow reaction equals death. Ironically, their godfather is Schumer, one of the most press-hungry politicians in history. The Clinton campaign's pugnacious press secretary, Phil Singer, spent several years as Schumer's spokesman. Clinton press aides Jay Carson and Blake Zeff are also ex-Schumer hands.

The defining quality of that machine is, simply, impenetrability. Reporting any story the Clintonites haven't specifically encouraged can be like wading through mud. "Their rule is never to volunteer information--ever," says one reporter who has experienced this. (Process stories are particularly verboten.) Another is a willingness to offer access to Clinton only under strictly controlled circumstances--as when she agreed to appear on the major TV networks the day her candidacy launched on the condition that the interviews be short and unedited, allowing precious little time for unrelated queries. In a testament to the enormous power of Hillary's celebrity, her single greatest point of leverage with the media, no one refused.

The Clintonites are also defined by their obsessive determination never to be caught off-guard by bad news. Whenever possible, they seek to release it on their own terms. In May, the campaign spoiled the summer rollout of two Clinton biographies, Gerth and Van Natta's Her Way and Bernstein's A Woman In Charge, by obtaining advance copies and leaking them to The Washington Post on the Friday before Memorial Day weekend. Employing another signature technique--the dismissive put-down--Philippe Reines, Hillary's Senate spokesman, asked the Post, "Is it possible to be quoted yawning?" And long-time Clinton associate Taylor Branch, a key source for Her Way's newsiest anecdote--that the Clintons had a "20-year project" for Hillary to become president--came forward to deny the story. Scoring embargoed galleys is a Clinton specialty. Sally Bedell Smith, author of the recent Clinton biography For Love of Politics, says she was "thunderstruck" to learn from Clinton friend Terry McAuliffe, weeks before the book's release, that Bill Clinton had already read it. "It was unnerving that he could have gotten a copy at that stage," she says. (McAuliffe denies making this statement to Bedell Smith. A source close to him says he refutes the alleged comments from the "brief social conversation.")

Adding to the Clinton camp's reputation for fearsome omnipotence is its treatment of media figures who cross them. Wolfson first refined this technique in response to Sheehy's dishy 1999 book, Hillary's Choice, when his intense counteroffensive--Wolfson trashed her factual errors and even showed up at Sheehy's book events to spin reporters--made the author, and not Hillary, the story. Bedell Smith adds that, during her research, one Clintonite told her that her book was causing ulcers "because I was someone with a solid reputation who would be difficult to attack."

Many reporters also suspect the Clinton camp of employing outside proxies to attack troublemakers in the media. After Hillary's shaky debate performance late last month, the Drudge Report--whose author, Matt Drudge, the campaign has assiduously courted--quickly featured an unusual blind quote on its homepage in which an unnamed "top Hillary advisor" said debate moderator Tim Russert "bordered on the unprofessional." Joining in the attack on Russert was Media Matters, the liberal press-watching website founded by former Clinton-hater turned Clinton ally David Brock. Many in Washington believe the campaign feeds material to Brock's site, as when Media Matters went after New York Times reporter Anne Kornblut last July after Kornblut misrendered a quote that led to an erroneous story claiming Hillary had criticized fellow Democrats. Not only did Clinton aides fume to the paper's editors, but Media Matters pummeled Kornblut and the Times for several days. (A count of Media Matters stories from October found 39 headlines defending Clinton, compared to 15 for Obama and just one for John Edwards. A Media Matters spokesman strongly denied favoritism.)

Sometimes, Hillary even gets in the act. According to Gerth and Van Natta, Kornblut was just back from a planned vacation she took after her story appeared when she ran into Hillary in a hotel. Referring to Kornblut's casual attire, Hillary cracked, "Anne, I thought you left Barbados"--revealing an ominous awareness of the reporter's movements. "That's their imprimatur," says the Democratic strategist with presidential experience. "When there's a story they don't like, they seize on it and turn it back on the reporter, and make it about the reporter." (Sort of like the way they handled women who who accused Bill of sexual harassment) (As First Lady, Hillary called for a public "frontal assault" against The Washington Post's lead Whitewater reporter, Susan Schmidt, according to the Post's Howard Kurtz, though the plan was never enacted.)

Several sources report hearing that the Clinton campaign has bragged about forcing one reporter at a major news organization from the Hillary beat. The boast, which one source heard from a senior Hillary aide, is incorrect. But the claim has become a part of insider Washington lore. Like the tale of the killed GQ story, it has only enhanced the dark mythology ( Of course it's only mythos. We all know the Clinton machine would never actually cross the ethical line) of the Hillary machine--a mythology the Clintonites don't dispel. "They brag about scalps that they take, " says a Democratic operative who has heard such tales.

Most Democrats in Washington agree that, had John Kerry responded more effectively to conservative "Swift Boat" attacks about his war record in the summer of 2004, he would be president today. (No doubt they do, but Sore Losers always have an excuse for why they lost that has nothing to do with them) And, if the Clinton campaign is overzealous, some say, it's because they are determined to avoid the alternative. "There's a Swift Boat around every corner," says one Democratic operative close to the campaign. "We'll be damned if we're going to let that happen again." Almost as important--in the Democratic primaries, at least--it is determined to show that it won't let that happen again. "They've cultivated this attack-machine image because they think that Democrats want that," says one political reporter. "They're pandering to the bloggers." This approach isn't without risks, however. Some people say a central problem for Al Gore in 2000 was the way the reporters covering him resented the lack of access and information they were afforded and (allegedly) punished him with negative coverage. Among Hillary's supporters, there are already fears of a repeat. According to one person who was present, the subject arose in a recent conversation among a group of former Clinton hands and loyalists, who fretted that the campaign's short-term press management success isn't sustainable--that its brute propaganda mentality will eventually taint Hillary's coverage. Some Clinton supporters describe a gradually harder edge, as evidenced by her post- debate coverage. One veteran Democratic strategist agrees: "Don't you think they're on the brink [of a backlash]?"

Perhaps not. Unfortunately for the beleaguered hacks covering Hillary Clinton, she remains the most reliable means of boosting ratings and selling papers in U.S. politics. And many of the strategists and reporters with whom I spoke were resigned to the idea that, in modern politics and media, nice guys finish last. After complaining about the Clinton machine for a spell, one political reporter fondly described how much easier dealing with the Obama campaign had been: "The Obama press office is nothing like this. They've got a very open and friendly press office." There was a pause. "But, then, he's losing."

Update: After this story appeared online a person close to Terry McAuliffe contacted TNR to convey McAuliffe's denial of the claim by Sally Bedell Smith that McAuliffe told her Bill Clinton had seen a pre-publication galley of her book. (See here for more.) Contacted again, Bedell Smith said she stands firmly by her account. "It is a vivid memory for me," she said.

Michael Crowley is a senior editor at The New Republic.

Does anyone really believe that the mainstream media is as tough or tougher on Democrats than Republicans? Are you truly able to delude yourselves to such an extent?

This is not an attempt to excuse or rationalize any of the tactics the Bush Administration has employed to control media coverage. It is an attempt to illustrate how it is absurd to contend the desire and practice of media control belongs to only one side of the US political spectrum.

The Democrats salivate over the possibility of reinstituting some form of the old Fairness Doctrine, which is a direct assault on free speech. The idea that they are the party of free speech is laughable. It is a common tactic of the left to accuse their opponents of the very things that they themselves are actually the real threat of.

It is also a common tactic of leftists to name things in the opposite manner as pertains to what they actually accomplish, example the "Fairness Doctrine," which places fairness higher than freedom, and it is the government's idea of fairness that rules the day, which again is not freedom.

We now see Hugo Chavez instituting his fairness in Venezuela to all of the people down there in many different ways, by squashing the rights and freedoms. He is now accusing anyone that does not favor his reforms of being traitors. He thinks anyone is a traitor that does not agree with expanding the power of the communist thug. It is an ongoing example.

The Democrats would love nothing better than to squash any dissenting voices.

The title of this thread is FCC Republicans again attempt to weaken media ownership rule (emphasis added)

You begin your post explaining how the dastardly bastard who is engineering this diabolical plot is A REPUBLICAN, and has numerous ties (even through marriage for Heaven's sake!) to the Evil Bush/Cheney Empire.

SIDEBAR: You make much of Martin's connections to Weily, Rein &amp; Fielding. This firm, as are all large law firms, highly cognizant of politics. That they operate in Washington DC makes their interest and consideration all the more intense. Weily Rein does tend to represent clients associated with the Right (Business for one), but I would like to think there is no inherent evil in this tendency as, surely, the Right is as entitled to legal representation as the Left. Weily Rein is no more or less sinister than the Frederick H. Graefe firm, Piper Rudnick and any number of Democrat focused lobbyists in DC.

Then (after some interesting exchanges with george) you respond to my challenge that you seem only to perceive bogeymen when they associate themselves with the Right with "It's not a left/right matter, in the normal or cliched sense of those worlds. There was Pravda in the USSR, and China will have its main information organs"

Not..."Yes, FDR, JFK, Lyndon Johnson, Bill Clinton et al did much the same," but evoking the Soviet Union and Maoist China as the counterpoint to Bush, Cheney, Martin, Martin's wife, and Weily Rein &amp; Fielding.

But I guess you're right.

But Okie, it's only fair.

Why should Conservative Talk-Radio be allowed to serve its particular audience when all these people want to hear are pundits who affirm their existing beliefs?

That isn't fair.

Liberal Talk-Radio can't muster much more than a feeble crowd to tune in their opinions, and so it is only fair that they get 50% of the airwave time now commanded by Conservative Talk-Radio. After all, we all know that the venom spewed by Rush and his ilk is terrible and so it's only right that the government step in and limit it.

You don't understand. If the Liberals didn't support Free Speech, they would be calling for the government to ban Conservative Talk-Radio. That may yet come, but right now all they are looking for is a fair shake at making their ideas known.

You just don't appreciate how imperiled we all are by the caustic rants of Limbaugh, Hannity, Savage, Levin and Coulter. These individuals, and their underlings have the power to destroy our society, and you have the nerve to worry about a strict interpretation of the First Amendment!

After all it's only fair that everyone share equally in the bounties of our society. It doesn't matter how much effort one invests, the reward should be equal. From each according to his ability; to each according to his need.

When my children were very young I asked them which way of life seemed better to them:

1) A world where everyone gets an equal share of the pot, no matter how much they contribute

2) A world where how much you get depends upon how much you contribute.

All of them chose #1.

Now they are young men and women and I am proud to say that they now all choose #2

Though they are all in their 20's, they show a maturity of thought that escapes so many of the intellectually juvenile who frequent this forum.

There are a great number of news stories that we can thank Talk Radio for reporting, because otherwise we would have never heard about it, or it would have been so de-emphasized or under reported on the next to last page, or distorted and mis-reported. As Rush likes to point out when he is accused of being biased and not offering equal time, he points out that "he is equal time." I tend to agree with him on that. After listening to "news," I need to hear the other side or a counter-balance.

A good example of the need for a balance was the CNN Democratic debate, which was scripted for Clinton, but was presented as balanced. If I view or hear something biased, I would at least like to hear the source admit to the bias, and all conservative talk show personalities that I know of admit that they present their views from a conservative bias. I can't tell you how many liberals I've heard that claim to be moderates or centrists, and it is nothing but their egotistical claim to being balanced, which is a crock to say the least. That is one of the reasons I don't like NPR. The Fairness Doctrine would bring more of that and worse.

After listening to "news," I need to hear the other side or a counter-balance.

A good example of the need for a balance was the CNN Democratic debate, which was scripted for Clinton, but was presented as balanced. If I view or hear something biased, I would at least like to hear the source admit to the bias, and all conservative talk show personalities that I know of admit that they present their views from a conservative bias. I can't tell you how many liberals I've heard that claim to be moderates or centrists, and it is nothing but their egotistical claim to being balanced, which is a crock to say the least. That is one of the reasons I don't like NPR. The Fairness Doctrine would bring more of that and worse.

Though they are all in their 20's, they show a maturity of thought that escapes so many of the intellectually juvenile who frequent this forum.

I would heartily agree with that.
</quote>

It really is immaterial whether or not Conservative Talk-Radio provides a balancing counterweight to the bias of Mainstream Media.

If someone chooses to get all of their information about the world from a single biased source, that is their right. Personally I would advise against it, but that's my intellectual bias.

If Air America had taken off and crushed Rush &amp; Co in the ratings, it is very unlikely that we would be hearing Democrats caterwauling about fairness on the air-waves, and if, in such a scenario, Republicans tried to bring back the Fairness Doctrine, I would find fault with them as well.

I'm feel fairly confident that blatham with contest this next statement, but the airwaves of America are open to all points of view. The Marketplace, not the Government determines whether or not they continuously occupy their space. Only when the government intrudes (Fairness Doctrine) does freedom suffer.

Clearly the dismal failure of Liberal Talk-radio and the crowning achievement of Conservative Talk-radio is not a one for one representation of the political leanings of the American people. If it were, we would have very little to worry about Hilary residing in the White House yet again.

That it is not, only makes the efforts of Liberals to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine that much more (charitably) pathetic, and (reservedly) dangerous.

I share blatham's regard for free speech and a free press. What I don't share is his quaint belief that the political forces which reflect my own sense and opinion are incapable of impinging upon these freedoms.

That would be absurd. It would, of course, be equally absurd to contend that there is corruption in the chinese government but not in the american government. Whether one procedes to engage in further study so as to make accurate distinctions would likely be a function of time, interest, and certain presumptions regarding what is true or certain preferences for one 'reality' over another.

Comparing the current US administration to the former USSR and the current China is pretty ridiculous and herein lies my complaint with your rhetoric.

I didn't compare them. It is an 'if X, then Y' argument using a real example to demonstrate the connection. If media control is effectively narrowed down in the direction of a single control point, to that degree liberty will be diminished. All authoritarian systems function this way and where information is so controlled (remember, it isn't on/off or black/white, it is degrees) there you have an authoritarian system. Five corporations now own the major media in the US. Would you wish it to consolidate down to three or two or one? Why not?

You begin your post explaining how the dastardly bastard who is engineering this diabolical plot is A REPUBLICAN, and has numerous ties (even through marriage for Heaven's sake!) to the Evil Bush/Cheney Empire.

SIDEBAR: You make much of Martin's connections to Weily, Rein &amp; Fielding. This firm, as are all large law firms, highly cognizant of politics. That they operate in Washington DC makes their interest and consideration all the more intense. Weily Rein does tend to represent clients associated with the Right (Business for one), but I would like to think there is no inherent evil in this tendency as, surely, the Right is as entitled to legal representation as the Left. Weily Rein is no more or less sinister than the Frederick H. Graefe firm, Piper Rudnick and any number of Democrat focused lobbyists in DC.

Then (after some interesting exchanges with george) you respond to my challenge that you seem only to perceive bogeymen when they associate themselves with the Right with "It's not a left/right matter, in the normal or cliched sense of those worlds. There was Pravda in the USSR, and China will have its main information organs"

Not..."Yes, FDR, JFK, Lyndon Johnson, Bill Clinton et al did much the same," but evoking the Soviet Union and Maoist China as the counterpoint to Bush, Cheney, Martin, Martin's wife, and Weily Rein &amp; Fielding.

But I guess you're right.

I would imagine the same thing, joe. But regulation of human or corporate behavior isn't occasioned only by some worst and certain extremity.

Indeed we do, but then we also don't make those regulations so stringent that they pose an undue burden on other interests. We may want to enact traffic regulations to promote safety, but we no longer mandate 20 mph speed limits on the highways or require vehicles to sound a bell in order not to startle the horses. The rules, in other words, must take into account the relevant circumstances, and they must change when the circumstances change.

Cross-ownership restrictions may have made some sense in a day and age when newspapers and broadcast television were the main avenues of information, but those days are past. Newspaper readership is in an irreversible decline, and the share of the public watching broadcast television is not much better. The multiplicity of voices now available even to the most unsophisticated media consumer is overwhelming. The competition for your local newspaper isn't the city's other newspaper (there usually isn't one anyway): it's cable news, national papers like the New York Times or USA Today, broadcast and satellite radio, and the internet. Why retain cross-ownership rules when all they do is prevent a dying industry from investing in a moribund one? We might as well prevent newspapers from owning telegraph companies and semaphore relay stations while we're at it.

And cross-ownership prohibitions do very little to encourage that multiplicity of viewpoints. With those prohibitions in place, we still saw the major media outlets (with the exception of the Knight-Ridder newspapers -- a chain operation) march lockstep with the White House into an ill-conceived war. If cross-ownership restrictions were supposed to increase the multiplicity of viewpoints they didn't do their job then and they're not doing they're job now.

We may have finally hit on the central legal aspect of this issue.

The function of the FCC is not to administer anti trust law. It is instead to regulate the issuance of licenses to broadcast media. The fairness and ownership regulations that grew up with the FCC were designed in recognition of the fact that, at the time, some regulation of this (then, before HD radio) very limited spectral resource was a practical necessity, and that some rules to limit the government's behavior in inadverdantly biasing the content of or creating local monopolies on public media were needed to accomplish that regulation in a beneficial way.

The explosive growth of other unregulated media, notably including the internet, internet "radio", cable "radio" and TV, as well as the huge increase in the the available radio spectrum with HD radio broadcast, have profoundly altered the conditions that obtained when these now archaic regulations were created. Joe from Chicago has described these changes very well.

The Justice Department remains in charge of the enforcement of Anti Trust law, and the very large body of case law that has evolved with it. In no other aspect of our economy or society is Anti trust law made and enforced by an administrative agency such as the FCC. We have laws and courts, with the attendant appeal process to deal with these matters.

All this is a good example of the mindless rigidity of government. Bureaucracies, Agencies and rules tend to remain in place long after the reasons for them have passed from the scene. In this case Democrats are trying to extend the life of now pointless restrictons to liberty merely to silence some of their rather effective political critics. This is a clear attempt to abridge free speech for political purposes. It is merely hidden behind a lot of irrelevant rhetoric about non-existant monopolies.

That's a lovely analogy.

You make two arguments here which I cannot contest in any meaningful way until I learn a bit more... whether these entities are really at risk from the changing media landscape (my understanding is that profit margins for papers remain high relative to other business enterprises) and whether the sorts of regulations I would have placed on that landscape would achieve what I would hope. There's no question we are being poorly served by the existing media system, as you say. But I certainly wouldn't want it to get even worse. I find myself turning increasingly to a growing community of bloggers who stand outside the symbiotic world of politicians, pundits, and related corporations. Still, there is the very real issue of the huge imbalance between the percentage of homes that get NBC and the percentage that get Talking Points Memo.

FCC Chair Forced to Compromise on Cable Regulation
FCC Chair Forced to Compromise on Cable Regulation
By Frank Ahrens
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday, November 28, 2007; D01

The Federal Communications Commissions voted for a set of watered-down cable regulations late last night, as increasing tensions among the agency's five members allowed the industry to largely avoid tough rules.

Under the new regulations, cable companies will for the first time have to give the FCC the most complete data available on how many subscribers they have. The FCC also lowered the price that cable systems charge smaller programmers, such as religious community broadcasters, to lease space on unused cable channels.

Yesterday's meeting followed a flurry of late-night activity Monday and throughout the day Tuesday, as commissioners sparred with embattled FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin, who they say has rushed the commission toward unmerited action on cable and other issues.

The fight over new cable regulations was so contentious that yesterday's meeting began 12 hours after its scheduled start, as Martin and the four other commissioners edited and re-edited the proposals, and concluded after 11 p.m.

Martin is taking heat from the cable industry as well, which accuses him of unfairly trying to crack down. The industry says Martin is attempting regulatory maneuvers designed to achieve his ultimate goal: requiring cable companies to offer their channels on an a la carte basis, allowing subscribers to buy only the channels they want.

Martin has said consumers should not have to pay for channels they may find objectionable, such as MTV or FX. The cable industry says that adopting an a la carte system would actually raise prices and limit selection by forcing a number of lesser-watched channels off the air.

Leading up to last night's meeting, Martin fought with the cable industry and some commissioners over a new study he championed that suggests that more than 70 percent of Americans who can subscribe to large cable packages do so, opening the door for long-dormant federal regulations designed to keep cable companies from growing too big.

If it were determined that the 70 percent threshold has been met, the cable industry could face a raft of regulations, including a national ownership cap.

But after days of struggle, Martin capitulated last night and acknowledged that the new study may not be definitive enough to trigger new regulations. Instead, he and the four other commissioners compromised on a measure that would require the cable industry to provide more detailed information than it currently does on its number of subscribers.

"I think it's important that the commission is taking steps not only to try to provide the opportunity for diverse programmers to get on cable but also to make sure we're gathering the most accurate and reliable data to determine what conditions exist in the video industry today," Martin said in an interview last night.

Increasing tensions within the five-member commission boiled over leading up to last night's vote. Martin received the harshest criticism from fellow Republican commissioner Robert M. McDowell and Democrat Jonathan S. Adelstein.

Both said they were prevented from seeing the FCC's data on cable subscribers until they asked Martin's office for the data Monday night. They showed that only 54 percent of U.S. households that can get cable subscribe to large packages -- a number well below the 70 percent threshold required for new regulations.

"They're trying to hide the ball from their own team," Adelstein said in an interview last night. "That's why the data was suppressed -- because it conflicted with the outcome he sought."

Adelstein accused Martin's office of trying to "cook the books" to arrive at the 70 percent threshold.

McDowell called Martin's study "the only fig leaf that could be found to trigger an avalanche of unnecessary regulation" on the cable industry.

Last night, Martin said that nothing was suppressed and that he was trying to give fellow commissioners the most accurate data.

"We applaud the leadership of each commissioner who questioned and withstood the attempt to use incomplete data in order to justify greater regulation that is completely unwarranted by the competitive marketplace," said Kyle McSlarrow, president of the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association, the trade group of big cable companies.

The messy fight over cable has caused some to question Martin's leadership of the FCC.

Last week, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) sent a letter to Martin questioning his management style and asking how much time he had given the public to comment on certain issues and given fellow commissioners to study them.

"To maintain public confidence in the working of administrative agencies, it is critical that the agency decision-making process is transparent and open to public review and comment," Conyers wrote to Martin. "Yet recent media reports suggest that under your chairmanship, the FCC is conducting its decision-making in just the opposite manner."

An FCC official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of continued dealings with Martin, said: "We are getting a growing number of questions from the Hill asking about commission processes. There are a lot of legitimate concerns and problems."

Excellent interview!

The Senate Commerce Committee Tuesday unanimously passed a bill to block a Federal Communications Commission vote Dec. 18 on loosening its ban on newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership

"A diverse and competitive media is essential for America's democracy," stated Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause. "Not only is greater consolidation of the media bad for America, but a process that would allow it without giving the public enough time to comment on it is not how our democracy is supposed to work. I commend the members of the Senate Commerce Committee on unanimously supporting a bill to rein the FCC in. Now, we urge the full Senate to adopt this bill."

Great. Thanks stradee, I hadn't heard that news.

Here's an interesting bit from an interview with Dan Bartlett <a href="http://www.texasmonthly.com/2008-01-01/talks.php">here</a>

<quote>
The fundamental change in the way people consume the news had to change the way we executed a communications strategy at the White House.

Q. How much attention did you pay to the programs on cable?

I never worried about a certain cable show. What I was looking for were trends that were shaping the narrative and the conventional wisdom and whether we had to be in front of or behind those things.

Q. What about the blogs?

We had to set up a whole new apparatus to deal with the challenges they pose. Are they real journalists? The Washington Post, for example, has journalists who are now bloggers. Do you treat them as bloggers? Do they get credentials?

Q. Let's think of it as a practical matter. If one of those journalists-turned-bloggers, Chris Cillizza, e-mails you to say he needs an interview, and at the same time one of the Post's print reporters-say, Dan Balz-e-mails you and says he needs an interview, and you can do only one...

Balz.

Q. Because the print edition of the Post has more of an impact?

Because Balz is on multiple platforms. He's booked more easily on television. He's read by more people. He influences people a bit more. Now, the question might not be as much Chris versus Dan as maybe, "Is it Dan Balz or one of the guys at [the conservative blog] Power Line?"

Q. Yeah, or what if [conservative blogger] Hugh Hewitt called?

That's when you start going, "Hmm..." Because they do reach people who are influential.

Q. Well, they reach the president's base.

That's what I mean by influential. I mean, talk about a direct IV into the vein of your support. It's a very efficient way to communicate. They regurgitate exactly and put up on their blogs what you said to them. It is something that we've cultivated and have really tried to put quite a bit of focus on.

Bernie, they all have political/commercial interests! However, 43% of ownership is way to high imo, giving them over 50% - forget any sort of media balance. That and the fact Martin believed he could change the rules indiscriminately - and financial institutions lending billions at a moments notice, etc. Congress will step in, but we haven't seen the last of conservative control tactics.

Criticism of the FCC's chairman is widely aired

'Lone operator' is said to keep plans from colleagues and manage the agency ineffectively.

By Jim Puzzanghera, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer
December 10, 2007
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission's monthly meetings are scheduled to start at 9:30 a.m. Under Chairman Kevin J. Martin, the trains don't always run on time, and recently they've come close to veering off the rails.

On Nov. 27, for instance, the FCC was slated to consider controversial proposals dealing with potential new cable TV regulations and increasing women and minority ownership of broadcast stations. Journalists, lobbyists and spectators waited as the five commissioners on the fractious panel wrangled over the issues eight floors above. When they finally showed up for the public session -- nearly 12 hours late -- the few spectators remaining had front-row seats for the sniping and accusations that are threatening to become hallmarks of FCC meetings.

Critics usually blame Martin, a soft-spoken Republican known as a political tactician who has accomplished the rare feat of being criticized by all four of his fellow commissioners. He is also facing a congressional inquiry into the FCC's procedures and allegations of flawed research studies, suppressing data, ignoring public input and holding hearings with minimal notice.

Senate to examine FCC media rules
Senate to examine FCC media rules
By Brooks Boliek
Dec 13, 2007

WASHINGTON -- FCC chairman Kevin Martin goes into the firing line again Thursday as the Senate Commerce Committee takes a hard look at his plans to reshape the media landscape.

Martin is likely to find himself under attack from both the left and the right over proposals he is pushing the commission to approve on Dec. 18 that would significantly unfetter media companies that wish to own both newspapers and TV stations in the same market, while at the same time he is pushing a rule that would prevent any cable company from serving more than 30% of pay-TV subscribers nationally

His push to alter the rules, in a particular the newspaper-TV station cross ownership ban, are garnering considerable controversy as no one seems to like the plan.

Broadcasters and newspaper publishers have criticized the Martin plan to allow one company to own a newspaper and TV station in the top 20 markets if the TV station is not among the top four stations in that city as being too tame. The Tribune Co., which has the most at stake in the cross-ownership battle, has asked the federal appeals court to strike down the order, even as Martin's proposal appeared to be a gift to the company which numbers the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and several TV stations among its properties.

The company argues that temporary waivers allowing the combinations should be permanent. The waivers were necessary because FCC rules generally prohibit one company from owning both a broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same market. The commission has allowed exceptions but does not permit any existing cross-media combinations to be transferred to new owners.

Tribune's lawsuit amounts to a legal maneuver to get the court strike down the cross-ownership ban entirely.

The FCC's waivers required Tribune to sell properties within two years or until six months after all litigation related to the agency's overall media ownership rules is complete, whichever takes longest

The affected combinations are in New York, Los Angeles, Hartford-New Haven, Conn., and Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Tribune received a permanent waiver in Chicago.

At the same time people who fear that easing the rule will concentrate too much media power in too little hands contend that the proposal is too bold.

In a late filing with the FCC a coalition of consumer groups attacked the proposal.

"Unless Chairman Martin remedies procedural flaws, eliminates dangerous and vague exceptions, and thoroughly expands meaningful minority ownership and local programming needs, his plan will not serve the public interest or meet minimum legal fairness requirements for FCC rules," said a statement from Free Press, Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union.

While the debate over media concentration issues does not break down exactly on party lines, more Democrats appear to support tougher controls than do Republicans.

Martin likely to run into a tough time before the committee as it has already approved legislation that would require the FCC to postpone action for up to six months.

The chairman's plan to impose the 30% ceiling on cable subscribers has also come under attack.

FCC Democrats Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein are expected to join Martin, giving him the 3-2 vote he needs to get it through the commission. It is unclear whether FCC Republicans Deborah Taylor Tate and Robert McDowell will end up voting with Martin.

The 30% cap was struck down by a federal court in 2001. Comcast has denounced Martin's cable ownership cap as totally unjustified given a video market that is far more competitive today than it was six years ago. Comcast is highly likely to take the FCC to court.

In another late filing with the commission, Comcast argued that imposing a de-facto ownership limit on cable operators while lifting the newspaper-TV cross ownership ban makes no sense.

"The very same types of concerns that appear to be animating the chairman's proposal to relax the newspaper-broadcast cross ownership rule compel the conclusion that a 30% cap on cable ownership can no longer be justifies," the company wrote.

Defiant FCC chief refuses to delay vote
Defiant FCC chief refuses to delay vote
By Jim Puzzanghera, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer
December 14, 2007

Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission Kevin J. Martin endured three hours of aggressive questioning from the Senate Commerce Committee, with lawmakers accusing him of rushing to help big media companies at the expense of the public.

Kevin J. Martin tells senators that adopting new rules for media cross-ownership will help newspapers.

WASHINGTON -- Facing growing criticism of his agenda and tactics, a defiant Kevin J. Martin, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, refused senators' requests Thursday to delay a vote next week on his plan to loosen restrictions on owning a newspaper and broadcast station in the same city.

Martin endured three hours of aggressive questioning from the Senate Commerce Committee, with members accusing him of rushing to help big media companies at the public's expense.

"If you move ahead and do it, you're a braver man than I am," said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). She accused Martin of having an "obsession" with changing media ownership rules that was distracting the FCC from the more important issue of guiding the nation's 2009 transition to digital television.

Amid complaints from within the commission and Capitol Hill about a lack of openness at the FCC, Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) called for Congress next year to overhaul the agency's procedures and alter its deregulatory bent.

"I am becoming increasingly concerned that the FCC appears to be more concerned about making sure the policies they advocate serve the needs of the companies that they regulate and their bottom lines rather than the public interest," Rockefeller said. "We cannot allow this to happen."

Martin was grilled about pushing the FCC to vote Tuesday on his plan to ease a 32-year-old restriction on the ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market. Martin wants to lift the so-called cross-ownership ban in the top 20 U.S. markets and allow such combinations in smaller markets if the FCC determines that they would be in the public interest.

Critics say the FCC chairman is moving too fast and failing to take into account public opposition to the plan. Asked by Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) if he would delay the vote, Martin replied, "No."

Martin, a Republican, said the FCC had been reviewing its ownership rules for 18 months and that the commission needed to act to help the financially struggling newspaper industry.

He said he was open to making revisions to his proposal, such as tightening what critics have called loose standards for determining if a newspaper/broadcast combination would produce more local news.

But when Kerry urged him to seek consensus on cross-ownership before voting on a rule change, Martin responded, "I'm not convinced on media ownership there ever will be consensus."

Lawmakers and public interest groups had expected the FCC's periodic review of its media ownership rules to extend into next year. But Martin accelerated the process in October, rushing to hold the final two public hearings with minimal notice and proposing to vote on a plan Tuesday, just a week after public comments were due at the FCC.

The moves outraged the FCC's two Democrats, Michael J. Copps and Jonathan S. Adelstein, as well as many members of Congress, who accused Martin of short-circuiting the process.

Fearing the consequences of more media consolidation, they said the FCC first should complete a long-pending review of ways to ensure that broadcasters serve their local communities and take steps to increase ownership of radio and TV stations by women and minorities.

The Senate Commerce Committee unanimously approved legislation last week that would force at least a six-month delay in the cross-ownership vote and summoned Martin and the other commissioners to testify.

"The FCC is poised to make some bad decisions, and it seems to me at this point only congressional oversight can get us back on track," Copps said, acknowledging that Martin had the votes on the five-member commission to approve the rule change.

After the FCC recently granted waivers to Tribune Co. of the cross-ownership rule in Los Angeles and four other cities, allowing it to close its $8.2-billion deal to go private by year-end, Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said there was no reason to rush a vote on such a controversial issue.

"Why give us an argument to attack you all?" Lott said. "I would plead with you to take a little more time."

If Martin carries through, and it looks certain he will, it goes to a federal appeals court. I'm uncertain how that plays out.

I'm confused too as regards the relative power here between the chairman and the committee.

OK...apparently the authority question is answered here. Such a committee, by itself, can't prevent Martin from going ahead.

You are correct. At most the Committee can promise revenge in subsequent legislative actions. Very likely Martin knows full well he won't be around in the next term and is therefore thoroughly immune to their threats. Undoing this action - even with a Democrat Congress and Administration - will have its political costs, so the battle is well worth the fight now.

Sometimes Bernie the forces of freedom, light and happy virtue triumph over those of regulation, tyranny and darkness.

Congress Asks FCC to Answer Questions about Private Equity Ownership of Media Properties
In March, we wrote about the concurring opinion of Commissioner Copps in connection with the sale of Univision Communications, where the Commissioner asked whether it was in the public interest to allow the sale of broadcast companies to private equity firms. That theme has now been picked up by Congress, as Congressman John Dingell, Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Ed Markey, Chairman of the Telecommunications Subcommittee, jointly sent a letter to the FCC asking for answers to a series of questions about the impact of private equity ownership of media and telecommunications facilities. The letter, here, cites the Univision case, the acquisition of Clear Channel and the sale of a number of Radio One radio stations to private equity firms, and suggests that these firms may be more interested in cutting expenses and maximizing profits to the detriment of the public interest. The letter asks a number of questions about whether the FCC has adequate information about such ownership to assess its impact on the public interest.

The questions posed by the letter include the following:

Whether the FCC currently tracks ownership of media properties by private equity companies.
Whether the FCC has assessed the impact of private equity ownership on localism and, if it has not, should it
Whether the FCC has adequate information to assess the impact of media ownership by these companies on multiple ownership considerations
Whether the Commission's Equity-Debt Plus rules need to be revised to take account of private equity ownership
If the ownership of these entities is sufficiently public and transparent for the Commission to review that ownership.
The letter was addressed to Chairman Martin, and he was given until July 20 in which to respond.

As we wrote before, one wonders if the Commission has the manpower and expertise to assess the true impact of private equity in the broadcast field. How could the Commission make distinctions between private equity funds and other companies that provide financing and investment to broadcast entities? Don't all companies have the same incentive to maximize profits? Various banks, finance companies and investment funds have invested in broadcast properties forever, and the Commission's rules seem to have been able to deal with such investment without serious problem. Why would these investment vehicles be any different? The Commission has rules, like the Equity-Debt Plus rules that limit the financial investments that companies can have in competing media outlets. One would think that the enforcement of these rules would be sufficient to govern any potential for anitcompetitive effects of private equity. Similarly, private equity should not affect localism any more than any other non-local management.

Nevertheless, these issues will no doubt be considered in the upcoming proceedings on localism and multiple ownership (whenever those issues are ultimately considered by the FCC). As Congress examines the role of private equity in other sectors of the economy, expect that these issues won't disappear anytime in the near future.

Divided FCC Enacts Rules On Media Ownership
Divided FCC Enacts Rules On Media Ownership
By Frank Ahrens
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday, December 19, 2007; D01

The Federal Communications Commission relaxed one media-ownership rule yesterday and held the line on another. Both decisions are likely to be challenged in federal court.

By a 3 to 2, party-line vote, the commission partially lifted a 32-year-old ban that prevents a newspaper owner from also owning a radio or television station in the same city.

In a separate, 3 to 2, split-party vote, the FCC reestablished a national cable television ownership ceiling at 30 percent, meaning one company cannot have more than 30 percent of all cable subscribers.

The meeting lasted more than three hours and included some heated language among commissioners. One, Michael J. Copps, called the newspaper-broadcast ruling "today's terrible decision."

The partial lifting of the ban would allow a newspaper in one of the nation's top 20 media markets to merge with a radio or television station in the same market, as long as the television station is not among the four highest-rated in that city. Mergers could occur in smaller markets, but they would have to pass a number of tests, including a demonstration that the newspaper was in financial distress.

The commission also approved waivers in a number of cities, including Phoenix and Myrtle Beach, S.C., that will allow existing newspaper-television combinations to continue.

The relaxation of the so-called cross-ownership rule was championed by FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin and supported by his fellow Republican commissioners, Robert M. McDowell and Deborah Taylor Tate. Copps and fellow Democratic commissioner Jonathan S. Adelstein opposed it.

Adelstein called the new rule "a monumental mistake" and, with Copps, called it a gift to media companies that will enable consolidation and restrict the diversity of voices on the airwaves.

Martin responded by taking the unusual step of directly addressing Copps's and Adelstein's complaints that the process was conducted without sufficient public comment, citing instances in the past where he said each of them had negotiated deals that were outside the public's view. Martin said he would never achieve a commission consensus on media ownership and that Copps and Adelstein were determined to delay action on the matter to avoid a resolution.

"I don't raise these issues to attack any of my colleagues," Martin said, detailing the many months of study that led to yesterday's vote. "Every time as I was crossing the goal line, the goal posts were moved."

The cross-ownership rule met with criticism from Sens. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) and Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) and some anti-consolidation groups. All said the rule would lead to fewer local voices in news and information.

Kerry and other senators have threatened congressional action to overturn the cross-ownership rule or deny federal funding to the FCC to implement it.

Proponents of the rule change said it would mean more local news, with television stations drawing on newspaper reports and newspapers able to offset the cost of newsgathering with television advertising revenue.

Newspaper companies fought hard for the rule change five years ago, but showed less interest in it this time because of changing market conditions in the television business. In the past, newspapers saw the high profits of television stations and envisioned significant cost-saving synergies between the properties. But that strategy was crippled by the rise of Internet video, which ate away at newspaper readers, television viewers, and the revenue of both mediums.

The Newspaper Association of America offered mild applause to the cross-ownership ruling. It is "a baby step in the actions needed to maintain the vitality of local news, in print and over-the-air, in all communities across the nation," association President John F. Sturm said in a written statement.

This was the FCC's second attempt to relax the rule. A broader attempt in 2003 was remanded to the FCC by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia, which said the agency did not adequately justify its reasoning. The new rule is expected to face legal challenge from a number of groups, including the Media Access Project.

A 30 percent national cable ownership cap was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit several years ago. Yesterday, Comcast, the nation's largest cable company, with about 27 percent of all subscribers, predicted that it would be reversed in court again, calling the FCC vote "perverse."

Copps and Adelstein joined Martin in voting for the ownership cap, while Tate and McDowell opposed it.

In an interview, Copps predicted that yesterday's vote would withstand a court challenge because the FCC has better justified its reasoning.

[3 pages of interview...what follows is the tail end]

CH: Going forward, what sort of challenges do you plan to this rule?

MC: There will clearly be a court challenge. I'm certainly going to complain about the process. Then I'll read his explanation. It's possible he'll write an explanation that makes sense, but I'll point out all of the evil mergers that would slip through his sieve, and contend that those mergers are not in the public interest, and that he's adopted a rule that would fail to meet the legislative obligation that would promote the public interest in merger decisions. So there will be a procedural challenge, and also a substantive legal challenge, both in the courts.

You may well get legislation in the Congress now that either tells the FCC it disapproves of its rule, or specific legislation that says "Here's what the rule should look like." Congress can take the decision out of the hands of the FCC. In some senses, decisions about media are so vital to democracy that they ought to be made by elected representatives of the people, and not by executive appointees at some agency.

Bernie, here's the latest info {i've read} regarding Senate action

Senate Rejects Media Consolidation
By Christopher Kuttruff
t r u t h o u t | Report

Friday 16 May 2008

On Thursday night, the US Senate initiated the process of overturning an FCC ruling made in December to allow for greater media consolidation.

The joint resolution (S.J Res. 28) passed by an overwhelming margin in a voice vote on the Senate floor.

The resolution, originally sponsored by Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-North Dakota), was cosponsored by Sens. Hillary Clinton (D-New York), Barack Obama (D-Illinois), Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), and a long list of others.

"Today, the Senate stood up to Washington special interests by voting to reverse the FCC's disappointing media consolidation rules that I have fought against," said presidential candidate Barack Obama. "It is essential that the FCC promotes the public interest and diversity in ownership."

Senator Dorgan's communications director Justin Kitsch noted to Truthout, "The next step is for the House to take up the resolution. Senator Dorgan certainly hopes it will move quickly."

Congressman Jay Inslee (D-Washington) has introduced a measure similar to Dorgan's in the House.

The vote demonstrated a strong rebuke of the FCC's controversial rule, (FCC 07-216), which eliminated the 1975 ban on a company from owning both a newspaper and broadcast outlet within a single market.

"The FCC is supposed to be a referee for the media industry, but instead they've been cheerleaders in favor of more consolidation," Dorgan said in a statement regarding the Senate resolution. "Diverse, independent and local media sources are essential to ensuring that the public has access to a variety of information."

The FCC's decisions in December, and its policies since early in the Bush administration, have drawn a flood of criticism from individuals angered by what they see as an irresponsible and partisan stance of broad deregulation.

Chairman Kevin Martin has been accused of divisive leadership, lacking in accountability and transparency.

Martin has become the subject of a Congressional investigation headed by Congressmen John Dingell (D-Michigan) and Bart Stupak (D-Michigan).

Staff members of the FCC voiced their discontent with Martin's tenure in a memo to Dingell and Stupak. "The bottom line is that the FCC process appears broken and most of the blame appears to rest with Chairman Martin," the memo said.

The December FCC ruling on media ownership was split 3-2 along party lines and prompted fervent disapproval from citizens and government officials (both Republicans and Democrats). STOPBIGMEDIA.com claimed that the Senate received thousands of calls and around 250,000 letters urging response to the FCC's actions.

"The FCC must not be allowed to relax its media cross-ownership rules," Dorgan said. "More consolidation means fewer choices for consumers, and that is not in the public's best interest. There has been massive public outcry to these new rules, and they must be overturned."

President Bush has threatened to veto any legislation that overturns the FCC's decision.

Bill Moyers "Moyers on Democracy" was just released.

An excerpt and final paragraph:

"I wish I could say that journalists in general are showing the same interest in uncovering the dangerous linkages thwarting this democracy. It is not for lack of honest and courageous individuals who would risk their careers to speak truth to power--a modest risk compared to those of some journalists in authoritarian countries who have been jailed or murdered for the identical "crime." But our journalists are not in control of the instruments they play. As conglomerates swallow up newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, and networks, and profit rather than product becomes the focus of corporate effort, news organizations--particularly in television--are folded into entertainment divisions. The "news hole" in the print media shrinks to make room for advertisements, and stories needed by informed citizens working together are pulled in favor of the latest celebrity scandals because the media moguls have decided that uncovering the inner workings of public and private power is boring and will drive viewers and readers away to greener pastures of pabulum. Good reporters and editors confront walls of resistance in trying to place serious and informative reports over which they have long labored. Media owners who should be sounding the trumpets of alarm on the battlements of democracy instead blow popular ditties through tin horns, undercutting the basis for their existence and their First Amendment rights."

Doesn't get any clearer than that!

<post author="cjhsa" datetime="2006-11-20T08:27:00" id="p1">
Despite the words "humane society" on its letterhead, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) is not affiliated with your local animal shelter. Despite the omnipresent dogs and cats in its fundraising materials, it's not an organization that runs spay/neuter programs or takes in stray, neglected, and abused pets. And despite the common image of animal protection agencies as cash-strapped organizations dedicated to animal welfare, HSUS has become the wealthiest animal rights organization on earth.

HSUS is big, rich, and powerful, a "humane society" in name only. And while most local animal shelters are under-funded and unsung, HSUS has accumulated $113 million in assets and built a recognizable brand by capitalizing on the confusion its very name provokes. This misdirection results in an irony of which most animal lovers are unaware: HSUS raises enough money to finance animal shelters in every single state, with money to spare, yet it doesn't operate a single one anywhere.

Instead, HSUS spends millions on programs that seek to economically cripple meat and dairy producers; eliminate the use of animals in biomedical research labs; phase out pet breeding, zoos, and circus animal acts; and demonize hunters as crazed lunatics. HSUS spends $2 million each year on travel expenses alone, just keeping its multi-national agenda going.

HSUS president Wayne Pacelle described some of his goals in 2004 for The Washington Post: "We will see the end of wild animals in circus acts  [and we're] phasing out animals used in research. Hunting? I think you will see a steady decline in numbers." More recently, in a June 2005 interview, Pacelle told Satya magazine that HSUS is working on "a guide to vegetarian eating, to really make the case for it." A strict vegan himself, Pacelle added: "Reducing meat consumption can be a tremendous benefit to animals."

Shortly after Pacelle joined HSUS in 1994, he told Animal People (an inside-the-movement watchdog newspaper) that his goal was to build "a National Rifle Association of the animal rights movement." And now, as the organization's leader, he's in a position to back up his rhetoric with action. In 2005 Pacelle announced the formation of a new "Animal Protection Litigation Section" within HSUS, dedicated to "the process of researching, preparing, and prosecuting animal protection lawsuits in state and federal court."

HSUS's current goals have little to do with animal shelters. The group has taken aim at the traditional morning meal of bacon and eggs with a tasteless "Breakfast of Cruelty" campaign. Its newspaper op-eds demand that consumers "help make this a more humane world [by] reducing our consumption of meat and egg products." Since its inception, HSUS has tried to limit the choices of American consumers, opposing dog breeding, conventional livestock and poultry farming, rodeos, circuses, horse racing, marine aquariums, and fur trapping.

Well, assuming for the sake of argument that these positions are correct-- and I can make no judgement concerning their veracity given the complete dearth of evidence presented here-- they sound like the flipside of the National Rifle Association (which, along with their effrontery in helping to keep you from shooting doves in your own backyard, explains your apparent animosity) and just as extreme.

Still, if the life's blood of democracy is the clash of opinions, then I submit that their counterpoint to the NRA drumbeat is actually beneficial. When extreme opinions collide, the common (and common sense) ground for most Americans is usually found in the middle.

But you don't give facts, at least not any supported by evidence. You post what appears to be either your opinion or unsupported statements. Then you get all beaky when someone takes issue with any part of the post instead of posting evidence to bolster your point.

In any case, my point is that even if we assume your opening statement is true-- although it may or may not be-- they appear to be just as much an extremist advocacy group as the NRA. Again let me reiterate, because you seem to have glossed over this point in your haste to begin hurling epithets, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

To cjhsa : your opening post implies that the actions of the HSUS are morally questionable. Can you explain why you think it is wrong to oppose "dog breeding, conventional livestock and poultry farming, rodeos, circuses, horse racing, marine aquariums, and fur trapping"?

The NRA when talking about second amendment rights and priviledges isn't attempting to extend those to the guns, which is what HSUS is trying to do for animals. HSUS is an extremist organization to the Nth power. The NRA is not by any means. The NRA doesn't associate itself with and financially support domestic terror groups such as Greenpeace, PETA, and ALF/ELF. HSUS does.

We could also talk about the merger/aquisition of the "Fund for Animals", another extremist group with a warm and fuzzy sounding name.

To cjhsa : your opening post implies that the actions of the HSUS are morally questionable. Can you explain why you think it is wrong to oppose "dog breeding, conventional livestock and poultry farming, rodeos, circuses, horse racing, marine aquariums, and fur trapping"?

So you are only saying that the HSUS's actions are 'inappropriate'? It seemed like your dismay at their actions was rather stronger than this.

Hmmm... perhaps horse racing is not cruel, merely unsafe. Marine aquariums, well they might even involve less suffering than life in the open ocean. I've never had my ass busted by a bull, so I'll have to defer to your experience in that area. As for those pesky beaver (hilarious, and presumably unintentional, double entendre aside), I'm sure there are people out there who would agree that those who cause ecological devastation should be skinned, but I thought you didn't agree with such domestic terror groups?

But seriously... I know little about the HSUS, so I have a question:

Do you think they are motivated by compassion? If so, and if you believe them to be misinformed on certain issues, should you not be trying to help them, providing them with your expert knowledge and research, and trying to find ways in which their compassion can be more efficiently demonstrated?

I assume that, for example, the HSUS look at the meat industry and see great suffering. Their compassion motivates them to try to lessen this suffering. Is there really anything wrong with acting on compassion?

For anyone who might be interested in the other side of the coin, <a href="http://www.hsus.org/">you can visit the web site of the Humane Society of the United States here.</a>

<a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.summary/orgid/3848.htm">You can also visit the HSUS page at Charity Navigator here.</a> Charity Navigator-dot-org is a not-for-profit organization which intends to provide information for people to make decisions when contemplating charitable contributions. This is the Charity Navigator mission statement:

Charity Navigator works to guide intelligent giving. We help charitable givers make intelligent giving decisions by providing information on over five thousand charities and by evaluating the financial health of each of these charities. We ensure our evaluations are widely used by making them easy to understand and available to the public free of charge. By guiding intelligent giving, we aim to advance a more efficient and responsive philanthropic marketplace, in which givers and the charities they support work in tandem to overcome our nation's most persistent challenges.

Charity Navigator is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization under the Internal Revenue Code and does not accept any contributions from any charities we evaluate.

If you attempt to get an evaluation on the National Rifle Association at Charity Navigator, you get the following message:

We don't evaluate National Rifle Association.

Why not? We don't evaluate 501(c)(4) organizations because they are allowed to spend a substantial portion of their revenue on lobbying our government and not every donation to them is tax-deductible. You may be interested in our evaluation for The NRA Foundation.

The Charity Navigator does rate the NRA Foundation very highly.

The HSUS spends more than 75% of their money on programs. Their fundraising efficiency is given as $0.13, which means they spend 13 cents for every dollar they raise--anyone familiar with charitable organizations and fund-raising for charitable organizations will recognize that this is an extremely low efficiency rating, which means the HSUS is very efficient at raising funds without spending the money raised on the fund-raising process. The fund-raising efficiency of the NRA Foundation is $0.05, which is even more impressive.

In both cases, the efficiency of the fund-raising is likely a product of regular donations by interested parties which do not require the expense of solicitation.

The issue here is not one of humane treatment, but of animal rights activism. On that, I have to side with chjsa. I strongly agree with Dr. Robert Miller, who states that "animals do not have rights; humans have responsibilities". I can't say it better than that. Our local humane society has done everything in its power to distance itself from USHS because they are aware of the extremism inherent in the organization. They're not really PETA, but they are closer to them than to your local animal shelter.

HSUS is not an extremist group and has spoken and acted against the tactics that are extremist. HSUS opposes cruelty to animals and humans in many forms and have programs to educate about the issues and to help end practices that are cruel by law as well as encourage reduction of practices that may be considered cruel but that are not illegal.

Dem wants to make the minutemen "terrorists"

According to her own website, this woman used to be a social worker in a school district in Arizona. One of her specialties was advocating for "undocumented families". She also chaired the committee that ran the opposition to Arizona's same-sex marriage ban. That ban become the first state ban to be defeated on the ballot, in Nov. 2006.

Now this bill is specifically crafted to criminalize the activities of Minutemen, including the vast majority who do nothing but sit on the border, and call the Border Patrol when they see something. The hook is, of course, if even one of the Minutemen has ANY KIND of weapon at the time (sidearm, pocketknife, boxcutter or etc.), then the entire group are now "domestic terrorists", including the ones on another part of the border twenty miles away who don't even have a sharpened pencil.

I'm so glad we have individuals like this looking out for our rights. Aren't you?

Law would make Minutemen Guilty of 'domestic terrorism'

'Patrolling to detect alleged illegal activity' while carrying any weapon would be felony

By Jay Baggett
Posted: January 20, 2007
1:00 a.m. Eastern
© 2007 WorldNetDaily. com

An Arizona lawmaker has introduced a bill to revise the state's statutes on organized crime and fraud by defining "domestic terrorism" in such a way that members of the Minuteman Project or other border-patrol groups could be prosecuted and forced to serve a minimum six-month jail term.

Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Phoenix, introduced HB 2286 in the Arizona House on Thursday.

Sinema, formerly of the Green Party, had earlier submitted a bill asking the legislature to make changes to a law used to prosecute customers of immigrant smugglers as conspirators under Arizona's human trafficking law.

"None of us every dreamed it would be used in a co-conspirator fashion," Sinema said.

As WND reported, it was federal inaction that motivated Arizona lawmakers to approve the new law creating the crime of smuggling in 2005. Maricopa County District Attorney Andrew Thomas announced he would interpret the law to mean illegals caught with a smuggler could be prosecuted as co-conspirators if they paid a coyote to transport them across the border.

Now, Sinema is targeting border-security groups like the Minutemen with new legislation that would define anyone not formally affiliated with law enforcement, who patrolled in search of illegal activity while armed, as a domestic terrorist. If it becomes law, the bill would impose a mandatory minimum jail sentence, even if prosecutors recommend probation.

HB 2286 reads:

Sec. 2. Title 13, chapter 23, Arizona Revised Statutes, is amended by adding section 13-2320, to read:

13-2320. Domestic terrorism; classification

A. An individual or group of individuals commits domestic terrorism if the individual or group of individuals are not affiliated with a local, state or federal law enforcement entity and associate with another individual or group of individuals as an organization, group, corporation or company for the purpose of patrolling to detect alleged illegal activity or to individually patrol for the purpose of detecting alleged illegal activity and if the individual or group of individuals is armed with a firearm or other weapon.

B. Any city, town or county that suffers injury arising out of a violation of this section may maintain an action in superior court for the recovery of damages or for an injunction, or both. The court may award the successful party reasonable attorney fees.

C. If the court sentences the defendant to a term of probation, the court shall order that as an initial condition of probation the defendant be imprisoned in the county jail for a period of not less than six months. This jail term of incarceration shall not be deferred, deleted or otherwise suspended and shall commence on the date of sentencing. This subsection does not apply to persons who are sentenced to serve a period of incarceration in the state department of corrections.

D. A violation of this section is a class 5 felony.

Sinema and other Democrat legislators joined the ACLU and the American Friends Service Committee as legal observers during the Minutemen's project on the Arizona-Mexico border in April 2005.

"I've been monitoring the Minutemen for a year now," Sinema told vigilantewatch. org at the time, "and they're just scary."

Now, I have to wonder; if such patrolling is legal in itself, and I assume it is, and carrying a weapon is also legal, which I also assume to be true, how can the two combined become a felony?

Yeah, I know. It's legal to enter an establishment selling alcohol. In many jurisdictions, it's also legal to carry a firearm. The two taken together do become a felony. Still, this sounds a little odd.

I have serious doubts about this.
I am from San Diego,my brother is a member of the San Diego PD,and my mom and sister are both social workers for San Diego county.
None of them have heard about this,so your report may not be totally valid.

As for the minutemen being vigilantes,they dont fit the legal definition.

But either way,it is revealing to see that the majority of you dont believe in allowing people the right to peacefully assemble,if they disagree with you.

Its revealing to see that so many of you would deny the minutemen their rights,just because they happen to want to stop illegal immigration.

Also,I would point out this...

<quote>
Amendment II - Right to Bear Arms. Ratified 12/15/1791. Note

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
</quote>

In case you dont recognize that,it is the second amendment to the US Constitution.

Now this...

<quote>
26. Bearing arms

Section 26. The right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself or the state shall not be impaired, but nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize, maintain, or employ an armed body of men.
</quote>

Is section 26 of the Arizona state Constitution.

And since Arizona does allow the carrying of concealed weapons,and since doing so is not a felony,it is interesting to see that so many of you think that part of the US and AZ state Constitutions are meaningless and shouldnt apply to those that you just disagree with.

According to your link to the Time magazine article,the minutemen did nothing illegal.
They didnt enter private property,and their demonstration was peaceful.
So,what about their actions were illegal or threatening in any way?
According to your link,they didnt start any violence.

You are reading into that article what you want to see,thats all.

Also,this quote...

Does not even mention the minutemen at all.
Soi,since the Mexican authorities dont blame them,why are you?
As for using laser scopes (they arent actually scopes,but that is a minor difference) big deal!!
You can buy those at almost every WalMart in the country,and at every gun store.
That in itself proves nothing.

As for what happened in Vista,I would have to know more.
I am familiar with that day labor site,and as for the camps where the migrants live,since they are there illegally,they have no right to be there.
Would you be happier if the person that owned the property harrassed them and ran them off?

I am not saying that every person in the minutemen is an angel,but you are trying to lump all of them into the same category as AQ or Osma bin Laden.

You need to get off your high horse and see the real world.
Dont try to tell me I am wrong,I grew up in San Diego county (San Ysidro) and am very familiar with the problems of illegal immigration.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For other uses, see Vigilante (disambiguation).
A vigilante is someone who takes enforcement of law or moral code into their own hands. The term vigilante stems from the name "Vigiles Urbani" given to the nightwatchmen of Ancient Rome who were tasked with fighting fires and keeping a lookout for runaway slaves and burglars. In modern Western society, the term is frequently applied to those citizens who "take the law into their own hands," meting out "frontier justice" when they perceive that the actions of established authorities are insufficient. Vigilantism is sometimes vilified when it gives way to criminal behavior on the part of the vigilante.

Vigilantism has existed in some form for as long as there have been societies with weak law enforcement. In some cases, like Neo-Nazis or the Sombra Negra discussed below, the desire to impose the groups own values on individuals in society leads to vigilantism. In the United States in the first half of the nineteenth century, vigilantism took the form of lynch mobs. More recent examples of criminal vigilantism include the Neo-Nazis and other hate groups.

Listen, you're just a tad too ignorant for my taste. It seems you actually
cannot comprehend the serious violations of human rights here.

Interesting that you use that phrase "human rights"

What about the legal citizens "right" to not have illegals crossing their property and causing problems?
What about the legal residents "right" to not have to pay for the medical treatment of illegal aliens?

What about the legal citizens "right" to not have to deal with the related crime that comes with illegals entering the US and squatting on other peoples property?

You ae quick to throw the term "human rights" around,but you seem to forget that the legal residents of San Diego county also have rights.

<quote>
During the immigration demonstrations, which were orchestrated by Rob Allyn of Rob Allyn &amp; Co. who is closely tied with George W.

In Santa Ana California, illegal aliens swarmed around in mobs invading schools, carrying out violent beatings and in one incident a county worker had a Mexican flag plunged into his chest.

You say human rights like it is the catch phrase that should silence all debate with you.

What part of breaking the law do you not understand? Illegals should be treated fair, but they have no right to be here. If they are harassed while in a public place then so be it, they shouldn't be here illegally in the first place. Who commited the first crime in this case? The illegals entering our country without permission broke the first law.

If they are beaten and killed then we should do what we can to help them or protect them and if that means sending them home is in the best interest of their protection then so be it.

I lived in San Diego 6 years ago and worked with many illegal aliens in the construction field for about 4 years. I know how it works and I know how they work. When it came to working, I would rather work with a mexican because they knew their jobs and were very good at them. White people can be lazy and they don't seem to work as hard.

If you have ever lived in East county you would have a much different look on how illegal aliens have an impact on the local community.

You see that's where you are wrong. It is not the job of private citizens

If you're so eager to help law enforcement, why not chase after criminals, Baldimo? Or drug dealers? They certainly break the law and
engage in illegal activities. Go and get those people, they're far more
dangerous as a Mexican day-laborer.

Why go after the Mexicans and not the drug dealer, hm?

Your right it isn't the job of the private citizens to deceide who leaves and who stays. It doesn't mean you can't harass people who break the law. If a child molester moves into your neighborhood are you just going to let them be or are you going to notify your neighbors that he has moved there? You going to put signs up letting everyone know that a child molester has moved in? Well you might not because you think everyone deserves a fair shot. Me I'm going to let everyone know and if I have to I'm going to place signs on his lawn to also let everyone know who lives there.

I have considered being a cop but at my age serving in the military is enough for right now. Have you ever heard of a citizen's arrest? Yes it still exists and I'm sure is still used in some places. People who live in drug infested neighborhoods have for years harassed the drug dealers have done lots of things to try and get them out of their areas.

If you drive around in any area of San Diego it isn't very hard to tell where the illegal's hang out. Most Home Depots are a great place for ICE to start their rounds. If your here in the states legally then there is no reason to hang out at the day laborer areas because you can get a job with no issue. You know this as well as I do. Have you ever lived in East County? I'd be surprised if you did.

This immigration thing is like the war on terror if we don't handle it the way the Dem's or Libs want then it is the wrong action at the wrong time. We attacked Iraq and you guys started pointing towards North Korea and other such regimes which you thought we should attack. We start making a big push on illegal aliens and you want us to go after different types of crime. If it isn't what you want then it shouldn't be done.

Illegal immigration is a bad thing, it doesn't benefit anyone but those that hire illegals and it places hardships on the communities that have to support them. How many hospitals on the border have had to close because the illegal's flooded the emergency rooms and no one was paying for their care but the tax payers and even then it wasn't enough money to keep up with the amount of care that was provided?

First of all,I havent run away from anything.

Sorry to dissapoint you.

It IS the job of citizens to decide who gets to stay and who doesnt.
Remember,the govt is supposed to do what we want it to,not the other way around.

Why are you so positive that having illegals in the US is a good thing.
There have been cops killed by illegals,is that a good thing?
There have been people raped and murdered by illegals,is that a good thing?

While I will admit that illegals do jobs that Americans dont want to do,that does not justify them being allowed to stay here when caught.

You didnt answer my question earlier.
Lets treat illegals here the same way the laws in their home country treat illegals.

And no matter what you say,it is obvious that you havent lived in SD county for very long,because you are blind to the problems caused by illegals,and the expense of them being there.

I suggest you talk to the billing dept at University Hospital and see for yourself how many millions of dollars that they are owed by illegals,and ask them what services they have had to cut.

Go to Otay Mesa and ask those business's there the problem they have with illegals committing burglaries there.

Go out to the east county,go to Campo or Boulevard or Descanso and see the trash left at immigrant camps.
Those camps are a health hazard by themselves.

Now,you can remain blind to the problems caused by illegals,but the rest of us know the problems and will continue to try and stop illegals from violating our laws by entering the country.

Plenty of Americans do not clean their own toilet, mow their own lawn and they certainly do not process their own food. I have done all of the above for some American at some point.

Actually Okie, Im willing to agree - partly. I assume because of this belief you do not eat at McDonalds (or any other fast food) chicken from Tyson or pork from Jimmie Dean. And of course you would never shop at Walmart - a big employer of illegals and the number one destroyer of well paying jobs in the US.

All factory farms use illegal labor and McDonald's started the problem years ago by demanding cheaply processed meat. Meat cutting was once a well paid profession until Big Agra started to bow to the demands of places like McDonalds. I agree that restoring this industry back to it's pre-factory farm days would give well paying jobs back to our citizens. Of course, the whole industry would have to be literally cleaned-up and I don't think people want to give up their cheap flesh, Personally, If I eat it I raise it or I buy it from the local guy who did.

However, on one thing I can argue from personal experience. I'm a landscaper and I know a lot of landscapers. I never use illegal labor, but I do look for carded latinos. Why? Because they are the best workers. I pay $15 per hour for someone who can dig a hole and move heavy objects, good money in my parts. I have tried to hire American men, most last about two weeks and go off to the mall to work for less money in an air conditioned big box. The Americans that last are usually the pot heads and only agree to work stoned. The latinos that have worked with me have all put in longer hours (willingly), were drug free and did a better overall job.

You say "mow the lawn" yourself. Well I don't do lawns anymore, but some of my best friends do. If you are a little old lady and/or disabled you are going to have a hard time finding someone affordable to help you around the house. Teens are too busy playing on computers to start a lawn mowing service. The lawns guys who use legal labor are twice the price of the guys who use illegal. I do what we call "estate gardening" - the reason being I can't hire a crew for less than what a millionaire can afford to pay for the job. Even when I offer a discounted rate to the elderly I always end up seeing some illegal latino clipping their hedges in the end. Lowest bidder always wins in America.

Ever pick strawberries on a commercial farm? I did and you could not pay me enough to ever do it again. How much should we pay for strawberries to make it affordable for farmers to hire Americans willing to do the job? Recently in my state they did a roundup of farm workers - 1/4 of the cabbage crop ended up rotting in the fields. Farmers could not find the population willing to go out and pick them.

Illegals are here because Americans want cheap labor. The Bush adminstration is willing to do a guest worker program because they know the Agra Biz needs them to keep their corporate machines running. Americans want cheap food and cheap servants.

A few years ago a garden pottery company in my area moved to Mexico. They claimed Americans did not want to pay the price for their products to be produced in this country with well paid labor. Either way the Mexicans (or Chinese) are going to get our jobs, and we have no one to blame but ourselves.

Actually a good post, Green Witch. Do you not see the hypocrisy of raising the minimum wage, yet not wanting to give up "cheap labor" for lawn mowing, etc.? I agree it is the employers that hire illegals, sometimes to compete to win the jobs. I also agree many, if not most Mexicans are hard workers. I have seen the same phenomena that you have experienced. Many put us to shame in terms of appreciating what we have here and making the most of it.

My only point, is why not shut down illegal immigration in exchange for a very healthy legal immigration program? If we need more workers, up the legal immigration drastically to do the jobs that need to be done. I see no reason why crops need to rot in the fields. With legal immigration, nobody needs to break the law, and everybody has proper citizenship, no hiding from the law and flying under the radar screen in terms of paying taxes, social security, and all the rest. By doing this, we also get to screen out known drug dealers, criminals, and possible terrorists.

In my opinion, the best way to fight the illegal problem is not by patrolling the border with thousands of agents, but by severely penalizing employers that employ illegals, and by making sure the employers have access to a good reference, registry, or ID system to make sure of who are not citizens. Employers should not be punished for unknowingly hiring illegals, so we need to make the I.D. capability attainable and easy. We also need to patrol the border, but if we dry up the demand, we also dry up the supply. I also see no reason why an electronic fence of some kind should not be built. It is cheap compared to the problems we are suffering as it is.

Most law abiding citizens want this problem fixed. The alternative is more economic and cultural problems, resentments, and deep division over this gigantic problem. If not fixed, it will cause much larger problems in the future. I for one am more than happy to pay a bit more for some products to make everything legal. If we are too selfish that we want cheap stuff at the expense of the rule of law and our fellow man, I say we are hopeless as a society.

Assuming that the police actually came when called, it seems that these activities are already illegal under existing California law. Do you see any value that would be added by defining this as domestic terrorism?

I don't like the minutemen. I also don't like it when terrorism is defined down to include every bully running around somewhere. I especially don't like it given the erosion of people's due process rights once they become terror suspects.

Thomas, I don't like the concept of self-imposed minuteman patrolling our borders, and having seen some of their leaders (locally) here on TV and having read that one or two of them have allegedly ties to white supremacists, makes it all the more disturbing. The law cannot define resp. test whose a fanatic or not, allowing such minuteman formation should
be prohibited altogether for that matter.

On page 2 I've quoted a newspaper clip from last year where 2 illegal
aliens were shot in an area patrolled by minutemen. The illegals weren't
robbed of anything, which made an accusation of murderous bandits
quite unbelievable. The direct involvement of minutemen could not be

Last year before many migrant camps were closed, the police was on
a daily basis called to the migrant camps in a town called Vista which is north of San Diego and heavily populated by Hispanics. Local TV crews and papers have reported extensively about the altercations between so called minutemen and day-laborers.

Do I think this is domestic terrorism? No, it is pure harassment of a
minority group that has no way of defending themselves publicly.

If you drive around in any area of San Diego it isn't very hard to tell where the illegal's hang out. Most Home Depots are a great place for ICE to start their rounds. If your here in the states legally then there is no reason to hang out at the day laborer areas because you can get a job with no issue. You know this as well as I do. Have you ever lived in East County? I'd be surprised if you did.

This immigration thing is like the war on terror if we don't handle it the way the Dem's or Libs want then it is the wrong action at the wrong time. We attacked Iraq and you guys started pointing towards North Korea and other such regimes which you thought we should attack. We start making a big push on illegal aliens and you want us to go after different types of crime. If it isn't what you want then it shouldn't be done.

Illegal immigration is a bad thing, it doesn't benefit anyone but those that hire illegals and it places hardships on the communities that have to support them. How many hospitals on the border have had to close because the illegal's flooded the emergency rooms and no one was paying for their care but the tax payers and even then it wasn't enough money to keep up with the amount of care that was provided?

No, I have never lived in East County, but that doesn't mean I am not
aware of the huge illegal immigrant problem. Let's face it, we all know
that the states bordering Mexico are saturated with illegal immigrants.
That doesn't give us the right to harass them and treat them as second
class human beings. There are other methods of solving this problem.

Allowing them (illegals) guest-worker status would not only benefit
our economy through increased revenues and taxes, it also would
protect the immigrants from being exploited by employers, and it
would save them from being harassed by anyone who is inclined to
do so.

Thomas, I don't like the concept of self-imposed minuteman patrolling our borders, and having seen some of their leaders (locally) here on TV and having read that one or two of them have allegedly ties to white supremacists, makes it all the more disturbing. The law cannot define resp. test whose a fanatic or not, allowing such minuteman formation should
be prohibited altogether for that matter.

So,you would favor denying the constitutional right to peaceably assemble just because you disagree with their position?
And you yourself said the ties were ALLEGED.
So,if its alleged that you have ties to a violent militant group does that mean that you no longer have the right to assemble PEACEFULLY?

On page 2 I've quoted a newspaper clip from last year where 2 illegal
aliens were shot in an area patrolled by minutemen. The illegals weren't
robbed of anything, which made an accusation of murderous bandits
quite unbelievable. The direct involvement of minutemen could not be
proven, however. Everyone draws their own conclusions.

But you have no proof that the minutemen or any person aligned with them shot them,and you said that.
Now,does that mean that the minutemen are guilty just because you think they are?
I am very familiar with the town of Vista,and the tri-cities in general.
There are enough violent criminals in that area that you trying to pin an assault on someone that is only guilty of disagreeing with you is pretty silly.

Last year before many migrant camps were closed, the police was on
a daily basis called to the migrant camps in a town called Vista which is north of San Diego and heavily populated by Hispanics. Local TV crews and papers have reported extensively about the altercations between so called minutemen and day-laborers.

So,someone that claims to belong to the minutemen is a member?
IF that is the logic you are using,then I am a member of an illegal immigrant family and I demand you treat me with all the rights you want illegals to have.
I want free medical care for life,I want you to learn whatever language I decide to speak,I want my kids to be educated in that language only, and I want the right to flout any laws I choose,just bewcause I disagree with them.

Actually a good post, Green Witch. Do you not see the hypocrisy of raising the minimum wage, yet not wanting to give up "cheap labor" for lawn mowing, etc.? I agree it is the employers that hire illegals, sometimes to compete to win the jobs. I also agree many, if not most Mexicans are hard workers. I have seen the same phenomena that you have experienced. Many put us to shame in terms of appreciating what we have here and making the most of it.

Okie, I think for two people on the opposite end of the political spectrum we are pretty much of the same mind on this problem -maybe we should run for congress, just think of the great retirement and health benefits we'd get.

<quote orig_author="okie">
My only point, is why not shut down illegal immigration in exchange for a very healthy legal immigration program? If we need more workers, up the legal immigration drastically to do the jobs that need to be done. I see no reason why crops need to rot in the fields. With legal immigration, nobody needs to break the law, and everybody has proper citizenship, no hiding from the law and flying under the radar screen in terms of paying taxes, social security, and all the rest. By doing this, we also get to screen out known drug dealers, criminals, and possible terrorists.
</quote>

Totally agree.

<quote orig_author="okie">
In my opinion, the best way to fight the illegal problem is not by patrolling the border with thousands of agents, but by severely penalizing employers that employ illegals, and by making sure the employers have access to a good reference, registry, or ID system to make sure of who are not citizens. Employers should not be punished for unknowingly hiring illegals, so we need to make the I.D. capability attainable and easy. We also need to patrol the border, but if we dry up the demand, we also dry up the supply. I also see no reason why an electronic fence of some kind should not be built. It is cheap compared to the problems we are suffering as it is.
</quote>

I agree employers need to be held responsible, although I've seen some excellent fake papers. Do you know about the H2Q program? This is a program that hooks up migrant workers with farmers. It makes sure the migrants are treated fairly and the farmers get the labor they need. At the moment the program is too small and clunky to meet demand, but I think if the government can get it's act together and expands it, there would be no need for border fences - and in the long run it would be a lot cheaper.

It would basically work like an employment agency for Mexicans who are poor and have few resources. The Mexican workers do not become permanent residents of the US, but they are entitled to certain benefits while they are here. If a Mexican worker knows he can go back to Mexico to use their socialized health care system, see his family (thus children and spouse can stay behind) and be able to safely return to his US job, it would eliminate many of the strains on our system. Workers can be screened for criminal records and no innocent people have to die in the desert.

Cyclops, it is our policy or the law not to turn anyone away from treatment at a hospital emergency room. A hospital cannot simply refuse to treat people, if I understand the law correctly. Haven't you heard that is why emergency rooms are clogged with people wanting treatment for a sore throat, a sore back, and other mundane ailments that people normally go to the doctor for. If you show up at an emergency room, it is essentially the same thing as demanding treatment, because you know the hospital has to provide treatment. I think Mysteryman is right on when he points out some hospitals are in dire straits or going belly up in some areas close to the border. I have heard the same thing, and it all adds up and agrees with what we know is happening.

Sure it is. If you show up to the ER with a runny nose and nothing else wrong with you, then that is demanding free health care. Go to your local ER and tell me how many non-english speakers are in there. Last time I went in there were only about 2 families out of 10 that didn't speak spanish. That makes it about 80% to 20% that were spanish speakers. Now they didn't speak english and I know this because they had to request a translator so they could speak to the Dr.

You guys don't seem to understand that I am also against illegal immigration. I want to see the border closed, pronto. In fact, I have advocated in the past doing so in a manner which threatens the well-being of those who are attempting to cross illegally, an idea for which I was called all sorts of names.

I am not on opposite sides from you; I just think that arguments against illegal immigration need to be clear and well-defined in order to be effective.

Right now there isn't a law saying that English is the official language of America. That's cool with me; we've gotten by just fine for years without such a law. So we provide ballots for those who can't read English well, because elections are occasions where you don't want there to be errors in translation. We provide schooling with English as the second language because there is a feeling that it is more important to teach the kids about a wide variety of subjects and bring their English along in time - it can take a long long time to learn English, especially if you are a ten year old from Katmandu or something and frankly not too intelligent - than it is to ram english down their throats. Given the gigantic number of legal immigrants and those who have Green Cards in the southern region of the US, there is every chance that a room full of children who don't speak the English have parents who are here legally.

We won't get the border closed with incomplete arguments, or ones where immigration could as easily be the cause as illegal immigration. Talk about stopping terrorists and gang members from entering; talk about drug smuggling and slavery; talk about sovereignty of America's soil and our right to defend it. The talk that can be misconstrued as some sort of anti-immigrant feeling or racism isn't going to help us.

It isn't xenophobia. I don't have a problem with immigration at all. But I do want to see the border closed for the reasons I listed above (with the exception of drug smuggling, which I don't really care about).

You can't simultaneously have a War on Terror and open borders. It doesn't work. I'm no Bushite, I don't believe that this is the 'struggle of our times,' but that doesn't mean that AQ doesn't exist or that we shouldn't be beefing up our defenses.

I am, of course, pro-amnesty for those who are already here and would like to see an expanded program for allowing more people to immigrate legally; but I have no truck with illegal immigrants and the problems they cause.

I have personal experience with this that also shapes my opinion, but I've chided others for anecdotal evidence before so I won't bring it up unless someone thinks it is relevant in some way.

HB 2286 reads:

Sec. 2. Title 13, chapter 23, Arizona Revised Statutes, is amended by adding section 13-2320, to read:

13-2320. Domestic terrorism; classification

A. An individual or group of individuals commits domestic terrorism if the individual or group of individuals are not affiliated with a local, state or federal law enforcement entity and associate with another individual or group of individuals as an organization, group, corporation or company for the purpose of patrolling to detect alleged illegal activity or to individually patrol for the purpose of detecting alleged illegal activity and if the individual or group of individuals is armed with a firearm or other weapon.
</quote>

OK, first:

I dont like the Minutemen none. I dont agree with what they stand for, with their tactics, nor their rhetorics.

And I'd be very, very wary indeed about groups of volunteers scouring around the neighbourhood to uncover crimes, wearing weapons. It would certainly be forbidden in Holland, in Hungary too, and I'm glad. That said:

This notion of legally defining people as "terrorists" when they have neither executed nor planned any terrorist attack is at least as scary to me. "Domestic terrorists" - that should be about McVeigh and political assassins, not about some bozos posturing as would-be cops.

Unlike in Holland, you do have the right to bear arms. Depending on where you're from, people carry guns regularly enough. So if you have a neighbourhood watch group, for example, the same as you would have over here, in Bumfuck Texas, the same guys would be carrying guns, yeah. Not a particularly comfortable thought, but considering that neighbourhood watch groups are often a good thing, and people are by rule allowed to carry guns, it seems odd to suddenly outlaw neighbourhood watch groups from carrying guns - let alone define them as "domestic terrorists". Yet that is what this law would do, the way I read it - its phrasing hardly applies to volunteer 'border guards' alone

A minumum sentence of six months jail strikes me as insanely disproportionate. On those grounds, I'd oppose the proposal if I had anything to say about it.

Finally, however, I want to ask a question. This is Arizona. The proposal sounds to me like something that has no chance in hell to be passed in that state's legislature. Am I right?

what's easy to predict is that " you guys " cannot seem to enter any discussion without foaming at the mouth about librulls.

btw, if you go back and check the "illegal immigration" threads over the last year or so, you will discover that i am absolutely against it. and i put my money where my mouth is. i fired the best secretary i've ever had when i learned she was in the u.s. illegally. she was a great kid and i hated to do it, but it is what it is...

bottom line is, if you are pissed about illegal aliens, you need to hold the employers responsible and put their asses to the fire.

no illegal jobs = no reason for illegal aliens to cross the border.

Those camps have been attacked and harrassed for 40 years that I know of.
I dont know how long you have lived in SoCal,but I grew up there and can remember those camps being harrassed back in the 60's.

And you just admitted that someone can claim to belong to an organization,whethere they are or not,and people like you believe it.
Are you really that blinded that you want to blame every bad thing that happens to illegals on a group that you disagree with?
Will you admit to being wrong when it is proven that the minutement didnt do it?

What gets me is that they know these camps are there but they don't deport the people staying in those camps. Why even bother moving them when that would give the impression that what they did by crossing the border illegally is ok. They should be rounded up and deported if they are illegal. The fact that they don't is a failure of the fed govt to act as the citizens of the US want them act.

Of course I have proof (as if the recent midterm elections aren't enough).

<a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/immigration.htm">Collection of recent polls by reputable (not politically inspired) organization</a>

As you will see all reputable polls (i.e. those not put out by clearly partisan anti-immigrant groups) have similar findings. Most Americans want both stricter enforcement for employers and at the border combined with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who don't commit a serious (i.e. non-immigration) crimes and pay taxes.

In every non-partisan poll I have seen, the number of who support a "comprehensive bill" (i.e. enforcement combined with a path to citizenship) is around 66% (two thirds).

Of course the far right is louder. But they still have no more that a third of Americans behind them.

I don't think deportation is necessary. If they don't have jobs or any government benefits as provided to legal citizens, then most would probably need to return to their country of origin on their own. Then they could apply for legal entry under an immigration program that would allow a very liberal number into this country. Good work records, all taxes paid, and other favorable accomplishments, as well as no criminal record should be considered. I suppose returning to their country of origin might end up being a procedural step, or mostly figurative, but I think it is an important element of this problem, if only to establish the fact that they could then enter this country on a totally legal basis with all the proper paperwork and requirements met. After some period of time, then anyone caught without proper citizenship could be deported immediately.

The important measures that need to be instituted are heavy fines to any employers that knowingly hire illegals and a total ban of any government services to illegals, and that would seriously curtail the problem without ever having to round up or punish illegals. This should have been done on a routine basis from Day 1, and if it had been, we wouldn't have the problems we are having now, and furthermore, we would have a very healthy and vibrant community of immigrants, totally legal, and not having to evade the law. They could be proud Americans and there would be far less antagonism and resentment in the population. Also, we would not have people dying in the desert, dying in overheated trucks, drowning in the Rio Grande, dying in auto crashes where smugglers have 8, 10, or 12 people in vans driving 85 on bald tires, and so on.

Polygamists: Authorities Prepare For the Worst in Texas
</headline>
<post author="edgarblythe" datetime="2008-04-05T20:54:00" id="p1">
ELDORADO, Texas - Sect leaders at a polygamist compound in West Texas refused Saturday to let authorities search a temple for a teenage girl whose report of abuse led to the raid, and authorities said they were preparing "for the worst."

If no agreement is reached with sect leaders, authorities will forcibly remove the sect's followers "as peaceably as possible," Allison Palmer, a prosecutor in Tom Green County, told the San Angelo Standard-Times.

Medical workers are being sent "in case this were to a go in a way that no one wants," Palmer said. Law enforcers are "preparing for the worst," she said.

"Within the religion that we have encountered, their place of worship is very special to them," Palmer said. "It appears to be of great concern to them if a person from outside their congregation even attempts to step inside their place of worship."

A search warrant authorized troopers to enter the retreat, run by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. They are looking for evidence of a marriage between the girl and a 50-year-old man.

Court documents the girl had a baby eight months ago, when she was 15.

State welfare officials on Friday removed 52 girls from the compound. Marleigh Meisner, a spokeswoman for Child Protective Services, said another 131 residents were removed overnight. By Saturday afternoon, 137 children and 46 women were being housed and interviewed at local community centers.

"They seem to be doing fine," Meisner told The Associated Press. Investigators remained inside the compound looking for additional children, she said.

The whereabouts of the 16-year-old mother who sparked the investigation are unknown, Meisner said. State troopers who raided the religious retreat were looking for the girl, her baby girl and 50-year-old Dale Barlow.

Under Texas law, girls younger than 16 cannot marry, even with parental approval.

Officials in Texas declined to comment Saturday on whether they had found Barlow, citing a gag order, but the man's probation officer told The Salt Lake Tribune that he was in Arizona.

"He said the authorities had called him (in Colorado City, Ariz.) and some girl had accused him of assaulting her and he didn't even know who she was," said Bill Loader, a probation officer in Arizona.

Barlow was sentenced to jail time last year after pleading no contest to conspiracy to commit sexual conduct with a minor. He was also ordered to register as a sex offender for three years while he is on probation.

His lawyer in that case, Bruce Griffen, said he had not spoken to Barlow in a year.

The search warrant instructed officers to look for marriage records or other evidence linking her to the man and the baby. The warrant authorized the seizure of computer drives, CDs, DVDs or photos.

Those inside the retreat did not respond to requests for comment.

The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints broke away from the Mormon church after the latter disavowed polygamy more than a century ago.

The compound sits down a narrow paved road and behind a hill that shields it almost entirely from view in town. Only the 80-foot-high, gleaming white temple can be seen on the horizon. Authorities blocked access to the gate, keeping onlookers miles away.

The 1,700-acre property had been an exotic game ranch. It is surrounded by dusty, wind-swept land where sheep are raised and mohair produced.

Eldorado (pronounced el-dor-AY'-do) is a two-stoplight town of fewer than 2,000 people and located nearly 200 miles northwest of San Antonio. It consists of a cluster of government buildings, a couple churches and a few blocks of houses.

State officials said they did not know how many people lived at the retreat, although local officials estimated about 150 two years ago.

The FLDS has been led by Warren Jeffs since his father died in 2002. In November, Jeffs was sentenced to two consecutive sentences of five years to life in prison in Utah for being an accomplice to the rape of a 14-year-old girl who wed her cousin in an arranged marriage in 2001.

In Arizona, Jeffs is charged as an accomplice with four counts each of incest and sexual conduct with a minor stemming from two arranged marriages between teenage girls and their older male relatives. He is jailed in Kingman, Ariz., awaiting trial.

Law enforcement authorities were able to enter a west Texas polygamist compound to search a temple for a 16-year-old girl, after an initial tense standoff Saturday. Though nearly 200 women and children were taken by bus from the compound this weekend, the teenage girl, whose report of abuse led to the raid, still is unaccounted for in Eldorado, Texas. She is allegedly married to a 50-year-old man with whom she has had a child.

Texas authorities search a polygamist compound to find a teen.Initially, leaders refused to let police enter the compound and authorities feared the worst case scenario and brought in ambulances.

I've been puzzling over the removal of the children from the polygamist compound. Wouldn't it make more sense to protect the children from abuse to remove the men from the compound rather than the women and children? It's the men who want sex with young girls. It's the men who force the teenage boys out of the compound so they don't compete for sex with the older men.

If the men were removed, Texas would not be faced with having to find homes for the over 400 children and they would not be separated from their mothers. The men-fathers could be forced to continue financial support for their wives and children.

Whenever sex issues arise, it seems the remedy always seems to be imposed on the women, not the men.

But, they've also separated the children from their mothers.

I don't think it's as simple as, the male figure is gone, and everything's fine.

These are damaged brainedwashed women, at least some of them.

Many would want to take their children and go back to their life with no changes.

I honestly don't know.

It depends on what the mothers are filling their childrens heads with.

For instance, the fact that the children are more forthcoming when the mothers aren't around. That indicates to me more than the normal "don't talk to strangers" message all moms give their kids.

With the mothers around, it's more like "don't talk to these outsiders about what we do"

I'm not saying the mothers don't love their children. I'm not convinced the best place for the moment isn't separate, so the kids feel they can communicate of their terms.

After having read this morning's story on the CNN WWW site on some of the stuff going on with this place I'm a bit confused as to whether there is something there or if the State is just ona fishing expedition.

One of the things that the state is investigating is that out of the ~200 minors of the female variety they have collected from the coumpound, 5 are pregnant.

Overall, Texas has the 5th highest pregnancy rate for minors in the country at 62 per 1000.

Extrapolating that out, the compound is running at a rate of 25 per 1000 - less than half of the state rate.

Now, I'm not saying that someone shouldn't be asking if these girls are being abused but if this is the sort of evidence the state is using to justify everything going on then there are going to be some huge issues very quickly here.

The issue for the compound is minor girls impregnated by ADULT males. Doesn't the pregnancy rate for minors in Texas overall involve UNDERAGE males?

BM.

There is a closed-minded rush to judgment here that is a bit shocking. Is anyone willing to think about this from anything other than a mob mentality?

The fact that kids are being ripped away from their parents without regard for their culture is troubling at the least.

The fact that Americans are jumping on negative stereotypes that demonize a religion is also troubling. As is the mob willingness to believe even the unsubstantiated rumors that are coming out of the early stories.

I don't know what I think yet-- but I am pretty sure that police ripping kids away from their parents; and lawyers representing kids automatically being pitted against parents without regard to what the kids really believe is a bad thing.

I am certainly not joining the mob in judgment before I understand a bit more than what law enforcement and mass media are feeding us.

Former member praises actions taken by Texas
(By Matt Phinney, San Angelo Standard-Times, April 15, 2008)

Flora Jessop, a former member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ, says she is proud of Texas.

"These (Texas) people have rallied around these women and children's care and the compassion they have shown," she said, "I can't tell you how much this means to me as one of the children."

Jessop, 38, said state officials are acting in the best interest of the 416 children removed earlier this month from the sect's compound near Eldorado.

It was Jessop who first told Eldorado officials four years ago that the people who said they were building a hunting retreat north of Eldorado were in fact members of the FLDS, a claim that turned out to be true.

She said she was born into the group, but escaped when she was 16 years old.

In an interview Monday from Phoenix, Jessop said she was not only glad the authorities took the children off the ranch, but praised those in Eldorado and San Angelo who have volunteered to help the children and women.

The children were removed on April 4 after allegations of physical and sexual abuse were reported to a family hot line in San Angelo.

Jessop said she has helped 84 women and children get out of the FLDS since she left in 1986.

"I'm proud as of Texas," Jessop said.

Rod Parker, a spokesman for the parents involved in the case, said Monday the state lacked justification in raiding the compound. "What the state of Texas wants to do is portray for the court that this is a bad group, a bad religion," Parker said. He said he is speaking on behalf of the women at the request of the FLDS.

Jessop said she understands why state officials acted. She said she is a cousin of Merrill Jessop, the leader of the ranch, and therefore is related to most of the ranch's residents. She described women's life in the polygamist group as "daily control, work and degradation."

While in the group, she said, she was taught that outsiders and law enforcement personnel were evil and her enemies. She said sect leaders instill fear in young mothers by making them believe their children or families will be hurt if they leave the sect.

She said once she left the group it took her years to adjust to mainstream society.

The children of the sect probably are confused right now but being removed from the ranch is the best thing for them, Jessop said.

"I don't think they will have a whole lot of understanding why this is happening," she said. "But for the very first time for these children, there is also a kernel of hope that they won't have to go back."

A former member might not be the best, most non-biased source of information.

My point is there is a rush to judgment here of the kind where people are excepting, without question, any evidence that supports their currently held prejudices.

I suspect reality is quite a bit more complex than the simplistic "evil cult" stereotype that people are jumping to.

I understand your concern, ebrown.

I would be worried if the "rush to judgment" had been made by the officials. It appears that concerns about child abuse have existed for quite some time. Officials believed action was necessary.

I guess I don't share your blind faith in officials.

The officials have taken some 400 kids away from their parents by force without any regard to the culture they were brought up in. I think there are legitimate questions about whether this will do far more harm to these kids than could be imagined.

Groups outside the mainstream always face prejudice that makes any claim against them believable. I don't know (any more than you do) what really happened... although there are reports that the initial victim doesn't even exist. But I have seen that prejudice against people who are not mainstream provoke extreme responses without regard to evidence and no time taken to question or think objectively. This is why I am skeptical in this case.

I am concerned that officials have again overreacted in a way that will cause real harm to these kids.

How horrible

The more I read about this, the more troubled I am by the role of the state in this.

Hundreds of kids taken from their parents, simply because of their association with a religious community. The wishes of kids and parents alike are completely disregarded.

No attempt to understand the culture involved-- any action of men is interpreted as "sinister", the women are portrayed as being incapable of holding an opinion, the entire society portrayed a barbaric.

How is this different than how we dealt with Native American cultures (or the justifications we gave for doing so).

larry king tried to interview some of the women from the compound, but whenever he asked about the men, the women would respond : "we want our chidren".
they certainly were not willing to talk about the men at all.
later larry king spoke to the leader of canada's sect, a mr. blackmore of BOUNTIFUL, british columbia - a pretty sick puppy imo.
when asked about teenage marriages, he responded : "girls are never too young to marry".
blackmore has appeared on several canadian shows and has made no bones about under-age marriages ( "it's god's will that we are practicing here", he pronounces).

i don't care how many grown men and women want to live together in whatever way they like, but when they involve underaged kids my sympathy stops !

unfortunately, canadian authorities at all levels avoid dealing with the problem. the provincial government says it's for the federal government to deal with, the police claim they have no authority and CPS are not given any backing by any of the other agencies - it's continuing year-after-year-after-year.
they only agency that might possibly be willing to tackle them at all is revenue canada, but they can do little about forced marriages ; they can only deal with tax issues, but that would be a start.

as you can see, this goes back to 2004 (and even before) and still continues to this day !

Investigation launched into polygamous sect dubbed 'Canada's dirty little secret'
The Telegraph/August 5, 2004
By Catherine Elsworth
The peace of a secretive polygamous sect that has quietly practised its controversial - and illegal - way of life in a remote part of Canada for more than 60 years is about to be shattered.

Murmurings about alleged sexual abuse and forced marriage within the 1,000-strong community of Bountiful have reached fever pitch as women have fled the group with tales of exploitation.

The "escaped wives" claim that girls in their early teens have been compelled to wed middle-aged men and have been routinely trafficked between Canada and the group's fellow Mormon communities in Utah and Arizona.

They also complain of biased and truncated schooling that brainwashes children into following the sect's way of life and leaves them ill-equipped to live outside its confines.

Geoff Plant, the attorney general of the western Canadian province of British Columbia, has now launched an extensive investigation into the allegations.

"It's child abuse of the worst kind, within a religious context," said Audrey Vance, co-founder of a support group for former Bountiful wives in the nearby town of Creston. "One woman who left said what goes on out there is evil.

"This is Canada's dirty little secret, but no one round here wants to believe what's going on."

The community was founded in 1947 by members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a group that split from the Mormon Church. Lying about 320 miles south-west of Calgary, near the US border, it occupies a sublimely bucolic spot at the foot of the Kootenay mountains.

Bountiful does not appear on any map. There is no sign indicating its cluster of homes, some makeshift, others extensive with well-tended gardens littered with children's toys. But there are "no trespassing" notices at its edge. Few residents of Creston venture in. They lower their voices when asked about Bountiful, and explain that while they disapprove of their neighbours' lifestyle, they do not wish them ill.

Outsiders are not so sure. "Careful," a holidaying father told his teenage children heading off to buy ice cream. "This is the teenage pregnancy capital of the world."

Although polygamy is illegal under Canada's criminal code, authorities have long turned a blind eye to Bountiful because the country's Charter of Rights guarantees religious freedom.

However, demands for an official inquiry have grown louder. One of those calling for action is Debbie Palmer, 49, who fled Bountiful in 1988, taking her six children. When she was 15, she claims, she was forced to marry a 54-year-old man, becoming his sixth wife, and was later "re-assigned" to two other husbands before escaping.

Her sister, Jane Blackmore, a midwife, left Bountiful in 2002 with one of her seven children and is fighting a custody battle with the husband she is divorcing. He is Winston Blackmore, 47, who calls himself the Bishop of Bountiful, and is said to have at least 25 other "celestial" wives and more than 80 children.

"We know of girls as young as 13 involved in trafficking across the border," claimed Mrs Palmer, who now lives in Saskatchewan. "And some have been exposed to horrifically abusive situations.

"What's happening in Bountiful is very worrying. There is a lack of information and education that means young people don't have choices.

"We have really terrible concerns about what is going to happen there."

The campaigners hope the inquiry will lead to prosecutions under the province's sexual exploitation laws that seek to protect younger teenagers.

The Bountiful community was split by an internal dispute two years ago. Mr Blackmore, the leader of one group, appears confident, despite the investigation. "I have nothing to hide," he said.

His sister, Marlene Palmer, 45, a mother of six who was born in Bountiful, said: "So many lies have been told about us that we welcome this investigation.

"We hope they leave no rock unturned so everyone can see we are not hiding anything. Then maybe we can be left alone.

"No one is forced to be here. They can do whatever they want. Some of my children have chosen different lifestyles, but I still love them. They chose to leave. They did not leave because they were abused."

She defended polygamy. "Legally, the men are only married to one woman. [The other wives] feel like we are friends."

Marsha Chatwin, 27, and her sister, Zelpha, 30, who are both married to Mr Blackmore, agreed.

"I love living the way I live," said Ms Chatwin, a mother of four. "I would never change it. It was our own free will and choice and I want everybody to know that.

"We're real close. We're all family. There's always someone around and you're never alone."

Meanwhile, Mr Blackmore's Share the Light website warns Bountiful residents to brace themselves for the investigation.

"Discrimination. This is about discrimination," he writes, but adds: "Like all persecutions, I am sure we will get through it."

Hamburger, this article obviously supports your pre-held notions. Are you willing to question your prejudices for a moment and look at this story from the other perspective?

There are two sides to this story as in <a href="http://www.canadianchristianity.com/cgi-bin/na.cgi?nationalupdates/050428bountiful">http://www.canadianchristianity.com/cgi-bin/na.cgi?nationalupdates/050428bountiful</a>

I don't support the polygamist lifestyle, and I personally don't want anything to do with being part of a religious community (especially a controversial one).

But it bothers me the way that this group is being demonized beyond what reason warrants. Dramatic unsubstantiated rumors and the unwillingness of anyone to even listen to the other side raise red flags.

But my main point is this....

Dragging these kids away from their parents is a very drastic step that will, without question, damage these kids in a dramatic way.

Do you really think that being in foster care in Texas-- in rushed assignments by people who don't accept their culture, is better than staying with their families? This is an extremely traumatic time that was instigated by the state.

Even if you believe that this religious community has no right to exist (or has no right to raise children)... you must agree that there is a better way for the state to handle this.

Hopefully the children can be helped now that they are away from the community. Parents don't always know best. We hope they do - but sometimes they are simply wrong - and do not have their children's best interests at heart.

My personal feeling, based on some experience with people coming out of similar cults, is that you can't hold the leaders in enough disdain. Sick.

my reply was a little hasty, and i'll modify it :

<quote>

i have no objection if they want to have children and are willing to let these children to be kids - however : NO underage marriage or sex with "old" men should be tolerated
</quote>

i do NOT know all the details of the "living" arrangements of the texas sect. i have however listened to blackmore and his views on more than one occasion (if i recall correctly, the groups were connected at one time but split over "leadership" issues - that's what i recall).

i don't see any serious problem with "multi-marriages or living arrangements" between consenting adults and having children in those arrangements (there are probably plenty of them), but when it involves forcing girls into teenage marriage - which certainly blackmore advocates -, i don't have any sympathy.

IF (and i do not personally know enough about the texas situation) there was sex between "older" men and teenage girls (and with the knowledge of the mothers), i don't see how at least a temporary separation of the children from their families can be avoided.
perhaps it'll turn out out to be completely above board - but right now my judgement is influenced by having listened to blackmore.

btw. during WW II millions of children in europe were separarted from their parents for long periods of time to keep them out of danger from air-raids (i was one of those kids and pretty well all my classs-mates were too). we all seem to have come through it quite well.

of course, a lot will depend on how the parents influence their children.
if they scare the heck out of them, telling the kids that those other people are going to kill or harm them, it might be somewhat difficult to convince the kids that they will not be harmed.

i am still wondering where the men are ? if they are good fathers and husbands, do they not have a responsibility to stay with their families, or at least support them in some way ?

i'm probably basing too much of my judgement on having heard blackmore speak.
perhaps things will turn out just fine.

from ebrown's link :

<quote>
Only two girls younger than 16 have ever entered into what the Women called "plural marriages."
</quote>

that's what blackmore said, but some of the former members seem to at least dispute that.

<quote>
Blackmore said it is the wife's choice, never the husband's, about whether they will participate in plural marriages.
</quote>

from the story i watched on CBC's "the fifth estate", it's the older women who have some say if they want to accept another young woman into the group. i have at least some doubt that a 16/17 year old girl that has grown up in such a community can rationally decide on the benefits of such arrangement.

as one of his former wife's also stated, she had delivered babies to girls as young as 15.
(i'm not blind to the fact that girls younger than 16 will have children, but i'm still bothered by the "bountiful" arrangements. )

perhaps what it really shows is that many children in our society are often not protected - from hunger, from poor living conditions etc.
perhaps the focus should be on ALL childen and not just those in the texas and british-columbia "compounds".
i must even admit that those children growing up in those "compounds" probably have a better life (they probably have plenty of food and love from their mothers) than some kids growing up in slums and abysmal living conditions right in our own countries !

One of the things that the state is investigating is that out of the ~200 minors of the female variety they have collected from the coumpound, 5 are pregnant.

Overall, Texas has the 5th highest pregnancy rate for minors in the country at 62 per 1000.

Extrapolating that out, the compound is running at a rate of 25 per 1000 - less than half of the state rate.

Now, I'm not saying that someone shouldn't be asking if these girls are being abused but if this is the sort of evidence the state is using to justify everything going on then there are going to be some huge issues very quickly here.

The issue for the compound is minor girls impregnated by ADULT males. Doesn't the pregnancy rate for minors in Texas overall involve UNDERAGE males?

From what I've been reading the State of Texas has NO IDEA who impregnated them and they had no idea how many were pregnant when they began the raid. (There has been discussion about running DNA tests on every member from the compound to try to sort out some of that.)

They are justifiying their "suspicion" on the fact that 5 of the 200 girls were pregnant. If that (in itself) is adequate cause for suspicion that the girls were impregnated by adults then they'd better lock down the rest of the state and get busy testing.

The question I am raising is "Did they have justification for the raid when they went in or did they conduct the raid to find evidence to create "after the fact" justifation?".

The longer this is going on, the longer it is looking like the latter is true.

There is another basis for the suspicion that the five girls were impregnated by adults. Almost all the teenagers at the compound are girls. Boys leave the compound when they are teenagers to earn money for their family. Girls are never allowed to leave the compound.

From today's court hearing:
"Why are there more girls than boys at the ranch," another child's attorney asks.
"Normally, during the teenage years, the boys will begin working outside the community to earn money," the expert says.

In addition, of course, the imprisoned leader of FLDS, Warren Jeffs, has been known to arrange marriages for girls as young as 13.

Do you have a link to where you found that? It doens't seem to match up with this evening's press reports.

"Attorneys for the children and the parents appeared to be trying to show in cross-examination that their children were fine and that the state was trying to tear families apart on the mere possibility that the girls might be abused when they reach puberty several years from now.

Only a few of the children are teenage girls. Roughly a third are younger than 4 and more than two dozen are teenage boys. But about 20 women or more gave birth when they were minors, some as young as 13, authorities say."

A reading of that paragraph would imply that there were actually more teenage boys there than teenage girls. (With the vast bulk of the 416 minors being pre-teen)

You will note I rethought and deleted my post that you are responding (this is a topic that upsets me).

You should understand why the experience of the Native Americans concerns me in this example.

This is an unpopular subculture that has been demonized and is thought of as "barbaric" by a large part of society. Their unpopularity is why the officials feel comfortable taking away kids en masse.

This is certainly parallel to the way kids of Native Americans (and others) had their children taken away. The arguments that it is in the children's interest (completely ignoring the wishes or concerns of parents who we have deemed as unworthy or unable to trust) is very much similar between these two cases.

The charges you list are, as of yet, unproven-- and charges of atrocities of unpopular groups; as sufferagettes, homosexuals, Italians and so many other groups know, are often exagerrated or just made up. I am certain from experience that many of the things you hear in the media are incorrect.

The idea that once a subculture has been demonized enough, that you can send the police in to take their kids without evidence that they were abused is very troubling indeed.

The question I am asking is... at what point is it acceptable for the state to remove children from a subculture?

This is clearly traumatic for both children and families.

Public prejudice, media accounts and even claims from critics are not a good foundation for a justification of this drastic measure since you can find the same claims, by people on A2K about many mainstream religions.

I don't think forcibly removing 400 kids from their families without any real evidence of abuse in most (if any) of these cases is a reasonable response given the damage that being stripped from ones parents will do.

There are a lot of questions and very little understanding of this group. Given the drastic nature of this action... asking for a little perspective is not unreasonable.

It is reported on our Tv news that one girl (aged 16) had 4 children.

assume the last child was born at 16 years and (shrug) 9 months.

assuming a reasonable gap of 3 months between pregnancies

That would make her 13? when the first was born.

Many other teenage mothers had one or two children. many had NVER been outside the compound.

This is a clear case of child abuse according to modern expectations and laws.

If this is true, then there is strong evidence that one girl was abused.

There are some 400 kids who were taken from their parents. This means 400 kids from toddler to teen that are facing the trauma of being rounded up, taken away from their parents, interrogated and then being left with strangers; the whole time being unable to understand what the hell is going on or what will happen to them.

There is no evidence that any of these kids were abused according to our modern expectations or laws. The rights of these parents and kids were clearly broken-- you shouldn't be able take a child away based solely on their parents religion with no specific evidence that that child is being abused.

This is a disaster for these kids.

Even if all the allegations about this religious community are true (and many allegations against unpopular groups turn out to be untrue), this was not the best way to handle this.

The FLDS compound had been in Texas for four years before any action was taken. The county sheriff's office has been receiving information about what has been going on there during the four years. It seems caution was taken before deciding it was necessary to put the children under Texas Child Protection Services.

Yes wandel, Officials always act with caution when dealing with unpopular groups.

- They were apparently wrong about the original cause (it seems like it was a hoax; <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/religion/5713823.html">http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/religion/5713823.html</a> )

- The knee-jerk fears that this would turn into a armed standoff (including the SWAT teams on hand) were clearly wrong as members of this community were peaceful.

- The rumors of cyanide stockpiles that were circulated have kind of conveniently disappeared once officials entered the compound.

It seems to me the officials overreacted based on the same fear and prejudice that makes people jump against this group without questioning.

Nobody is going against the group without questioning. The allegations of pregnant girls as young as thirteen will be poven or disproven. The genetic tests will help determine who is responsible, if anybody. If no youngsters are being abused, it will come out.

I don't think forcibly removing 400 kids from their families without any real evidence of abuse in most (if any) of these cases
</quote>

It is reported on our Tv news that one girl (aged 16) had 4 children.

assume the last child was born at 16 years and (shrug) 9 months.

assuming a reasonable gap of 3 months between pregnancies

That would make her 13? when the first was born.

Many other teenage mothers had one or two children. many had NVER been outside the compound.

This is a clear case of child abuse according to modern expectations and laws.
</quote>

Things like this are exactly why I popped into this thread and asked questions.

I read through 25-30 different press reports of the last 2 days testimony at the hearings and there was no mention of this in any of them. The State's Child Abuse expert stated that there were records found in a safe in the compound that indicated that as many as 20 women/girls had given birth within the compound but the youngest any of those girls was when they gave birth was 17. He testified that there was NO evidence of child abuse in that regard.

And the idea that there are teens that have never been outside the compound is just complete nonsense. The compound didn't exist prior to 2004. How it it possible that you have 13-18 year old girls that have never been outside a compound that is only 4 years old? The math doesn't work there.

These sensationalized stories being broadcast/printed are a part of a feeding frenzy. They are clouding the story more than shedding ligt on what's going on.

as far as "removing children from their mothers and families" is concened, at least some of the children were picked up by sect-members
from their mothers and families to be brought to the texas compound.
so at least some of those children in the compound do not have their real mothers with them in the compound.
a/t todays "globe and mail" (toronto), at least some of the children were from the "bountiful" compound in british-columbia.
(i'll post the article later)
it seems that in addition to other charges, there will be charges of illegal imigration.

i'm sure, there will be loud cries of "religious freedom". i wonder if the freedom and free will of the children was ever considered by the members of the sect when they took the children away from their mothers and brought them to the texas compond ?

"religious freedom" is often a nice shield to hold up for protection - but who protects the innocent children in the first place ?

Are you really saying that being rounded up and taken away from your parents is good for a child? Can you imagine if your kids were taken from you this way?

The actions of the officials are damaging the children.

Your prejudice against this group you have labeled a "sect" is keeping you from rational thought.

Do you not agree that the kids with a stable loving family and no evidence of abuse should be kept with their parents?

What are we at, two weeks? And the state still can not point to a victim. There is convincing proof that those who were rounded up Short Creek were traumatized by the actions of the state, this is the harm the Texas inflicting today. And for what? On what grounds? What is the good that will come of it? The officials who did this are heavy handed jack -asses. They want what they want and don't care who they hurt in the process.

Short Creek was a failure in every way, it was only when the states renounced their stupid tactics and started working with the polygamy communities that progress was made. Texas has destroyed these efforts for every other state. States officials have proven themselves to be untrustworthy, to be the enemy.

I think what you mean to say is that sometimes taking kids away from their parents is better than the alternative (it is always a traumatic event for the child).

But you are missing the main question;

At what point should the state take children away from their parents?

Given the drastic nature of this action, and the consequences to both families and the children themselves, this should be very rare-- and there should be a very high bar. The state should be able to show that the danger to the kids is worse than the damage that will be caused by the removal, before they take this action.

It also upsets me that nothing other than this removal action was tried. Talking with this community to work out how to ensure the welfare of the kids without this damaging removal would have likely resulted in a much less damaging or chaotic outcome.

My concern is that it is this prejudice... rather than real evidence or rational thought, that drove this decision. There is very clearly a lot of prejudice against this group; and already some accusations made against them have proven false.

Think about what it is like for the children involved; to be taken by the state away from your home by strangers and unable to talk with your parents.

The state doesn't always do right by children (particularly children in unpopular groups).

That is because the state wants to chase the community away, the best interest of the children is a trojan horse. The call was their excuse to go in an try to break up the community, it was fundamentally dishonest, both the raid as well as everything that has come after. This is why Texas has done so much harm, it will take decades for other states to overcome the harm that Texas has caused.

RELIGION: THE BOUNTIFUL CONNECTION

Canadians seized in raid on U.S. polygamist sect
416 children from Texas compound of jailed church leader Warren Jeffs will stay in custody no matter what their nationality, judge says
UNNATI GANDHI

With a report from Associated Press

April 19, 2008

The phone calls would come at any hour.

Warren Jeffs, the now-imprisoned leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, would tell the man on the other end of the line to get his daughter ready. He would tell him she'd been hand-selected to live in the "holy land" - Mr. Jeffs's 1,691-acre Yearning for Zion ranch in Eldorado, Tex. - along with the religion's most fervent adherents, whom he referred to as the "heart's core."

A van, he'd say, would be arriving shortly to pick up their daughter.

The southeastern British Columbia town of Bountiful, a polygamous community with ties to the Texas stronghold, always suspected that their children were among those being lured to Zion, just as their U.S. counterparts were.

Yesterday, confirmation came.

An investigator from the Texas Division of Child Protection Services said some of the 416 children who had been seized from the Texas compound during a raid this month are Canadian citizens.

During her testimony, state investigator Angie Voss did not say how many of the children are Canadian, where they came from or how old they are, but affirmed the children should remain in state custody regardless of their citizenship.

B.C. Attorney-General Wally Oppal confirmed that he was alerted by officials in Ottawa that some of the children are Canadians.

The revelation came on the second day of the extraordinary mass hearing over the state's attempt to strip the parents of custody and place the children in foster homes. District Judge Barbara Walther ruled yesterday that all the children remain in state custody and be subject to genetic testing, after child welfare officials said they've had difficulty determining how the children and parents are related because of evasive or changing answers. Individual hearings will be set for the children over the next several weeks.

The children were removed during an April 3 raid on the sect's desert compound, built around a white limestone temple, because of evidence of physical and sexual abuse, including the forcing of underage girls into marriage and childbearing.

The raid was prompted by a call from someone identifying herself as a 16-year-old girl with the sect. She claimed her husband, a 50-year-old member of the sect, beat and raped her.

The girl has yet to be identified, but Ms. Voss said yesterday a girl matching her description was seen by other girls in the ranch garden four days before the raid began.

Word that Canadian children were among those before the court audibly rattled Jane Blackmore, a resident of Creston, B.C., in the Kootenays. She had been married to Winston Blackmore, the so-called bishop of Bountiful, who has more than 20 wives.

"Warren Jeffs's community is very closed. Even people living in Bountiful don't know who's missing from where," Ms. Blackmore said in a telephone interview yesterday, struggling to keep her voice calm. "They've been suspecting that. There has been suspicion of that happening."

But Debbie Palmer, also a former Bountiful wife, said the idea of giving up one's child to the "holy land" was welcomed by those still part of the sect. She cited the example of one of her nieces, who lives in Colorado City.

"If Warren Jeffs had decided that one of her children needed to be taken away from her and raised in the Texas compound, well then I know she would have given that child up. In Canada, it's the same thing."

Ms. Palmer said the girls are typically between two and 11 years old.

"The phone call comes and he says, 'Be ready to go, someone's going to come get you and then you'll be told what your special mission from God is.'"

The adults at the compound are considered his most loyal followers and the young children the least "contaminated" by the outside world, Ms. Palmer said.

Mr. Jeffs, the breakaway Mormon sect's leader, is currently awaiting trial in a Kingman, Ariz., jail on charges related to the promotion of underage marriages. He previously was convicted of being an accomplice to the rape of a 14-year-old wed to her cousin in a Utah case.

everybody I think will agree that the wider society has the right to impose its standards of child sexuality upon the polygamy cults, what is at issue is whether Texas is going about it in a wise way. Texas and the other states also need to deal with the fact that poly relationships are rapidly going mainstream. Using vengeful tactics on the polygamy cults today will land the states is the same place that those who executed the Short Creek raids found themselves in, out of step with the majority of the citizens on what is fair for the state to do against individuals.

If you are under the misconception that child brides a new concept, or that very young females being married off to much older males is a new concept, then you should consult the history books. The polygamy cult practices are in keeping with how humans have often lived. They are at odds with modern sensibilities, however there is a case to be made that sub communities should be allowed to live by the old ways if they wish.

The Amish have a practice of making sure that all who are in the community as adults are there voluntarily, and the polygamy cults need to be encouraged to do better at this. They also must obey the modern child sex laws, but trying to get there through traumatizing the community and though the courts is stupid. It will not work

Such laws already exist. They're referred to as "kidnapping", "interstate transport of a minor", "immigration fraud", etc...

The problem with your argument here, as applied to this particular instance, is that the Texas authorities have made no mention of any such charges or, for that matter, that they are even investigating any such allegations. The article you posted doesn't even mention that anyone in Canada has even filed a missing person's report or any legal complaint at all.

You are fully entitled to your personal opinions - no one is denying you that. And no one is asking you to approve of the actiosns of the FLDS members. However, your personal opinions carry no more weight in law than those of Jeffs and his cohorts. Whether you like them or their beliefs or not is irrelevant. They are still guaranteed equeal protection under the law. Whether they are or not is the question being raised.

i guess we'll know in a few weeks whether texas will apply some of the laws mentioned.
as i mentioned earlier, canadian authorities - both federal and provincial -
have so far shied away of tackling the issue here. they are really quite concerned that "religious freedom" guaranteed under canda's bill of rights will be used to squash any attempt by the state to intervene on behalf of the children.
i doubt that the framers of canada's "bill of rights" - much cherished by most citizens and human rights groups - had ever thought it might be misused to prevent the protection of innocent and vulnerable citizens (children).

maybe everything that is being presented in the news is completely incorrect, but for now it seems that many of the children at the compound were not with their real parents - hence the DNA tests that have been ordered to find out who-is -who.

let me stress again that i have no problem with adults wanting to live in multi-partner relationships.
if they want to have children, that's fine too with me, but i don't see the need for needing sex with underage children.

as far as "history" is concerned, there used to be human sacrifices way back in history but i doubt that many humans see the need to go back to that ( though we have managed to use wars to achieve those sacrifices ).

I certainly think that the state has the right to know paternity and maternity, and to hold the parents responsible for the welfare of the children. There was no need to inflict this trauma on the community to get there however. I also see no reason for the state to keep the kids while they are figuring this out. Finger print everyone, take DNA, and send them home where they belong.

No, because moving a child must be done with care. Speed is not the goal, low trauma for the child is the goal. Texas should send the kids back to their home as they (the kids) know it, and if a change needs to be made then do it down the line. However, now that the kids are a ward of the state moving them out of were they are now will also be possibly traumatic. All would have been avoided if the state had left the children on the compound. There was no good reason to take them away in the first place.

The original phone call was evidently a hoax. If this was the case, this part of the affidavit is irrelevant.

The problem with the observations of the investigators is that they entered the community with strong preconceived notions. They were already sure of what they would find that they only looked for evidence that supported their beliefs. Even so, there is nothing I see in this affidavit (or anywhere else from the state) that offers an objective evidence abuse. The charges here are all based on the interpretation of the investigator.

This is not a very good unbiased source.

Part of the difficulty I have with this story is that there are no unbiased sources of information. This makes the real truth about what happened in this community very hard to ascertain.

With your reasoning, ebrown, every child abuse case is prejudiced. Every time the authorities enter a home to search for evidence of child abuse, whether the tip came from a teacher, hospital records, a neighbor or wherever, they go in looking for evidence to back the claim or suspicion.

Quite the contrary Squinney.

There are plenty of cases where there is conclusive evidence, or even strong evidence, that that a child is being abused. In this case I strongly support removal of the children (or any other appropriate intervention).

My point is that this need to be done objectively... based on real evidence. Whether other people dislike or fear the group should not affect the investigation or the decisions made.

I have no connection to or love for this particular group.

But there is a real danger that once a group has been tagged as outside the mainstream-- that people will then believe, without questioning, any accusation made against them whether true or not. I have no way to know which of these accusations are true (and neither do you), but some of them have already been shown to be false.

If any group, even these polygamists, can be stripped of their humanity and their rights based on public opinion... then anyone who is odd, or outside the mainstream is at risk.

That is why I am questioning the actions of the State. From the drastic nature of their action and the doubts raised by the case-- questioning the State is appropriate.

What you say is true. But in what percentage of those cases are the children removed from the household while there is an investigation? And how many involve more than 1 or 2 children? In this case, they have removed the equivelent of all the children of a small town. That pretty much removes it from the realm of standard practices.

I certainly want to know about the original two calls. They are very suspicious....the convenience of them, the speed at which the state moved after them, and because I have a hard time believing that a community member would be inclined to make such a call or even know who to call. I would like information on the cell phone used, and cell company records of the location of the call. It looks like a con on the part of the state, that they put someone up to making the call that they needed. The state has already admitted that they were looking for a legal means to bust into the community, that these call were just what they were looking for.

We should all be very afraid for our freedom and civil liberties in light of these events. It the state can disregard the rights of people we don't like they can disregard ours as well. Who knows whom the state will choose for their next victim, whims have a way of changing.

Although I sympathize with your general line of argument, this response to the police's affidavid is pushing it. Prejudices may skew the police's interpretation of what's going on. But it won't skew their estimates of a young woman's age, nor their perception that she's pregnant. Their judgment that she's a mother may be a bit more vulnerable to prejudices -- it's a close-knit community, where you would expect teenagers to hold other women's children. But the bottom line of the police's assessment looks pretty robust to prejudice: Underage girls are probably being impregnated there, and some of them are probably the victims of violence.

The police has probable cause to search the compound, and to build a legal case based on the evidence that they find. The stop-gap measures they take between the search and the trial may or may not be excessive, but I don't see a good case that they are.

EDIT: Fishin's latest response wasn't there when I started writing this. Now I'll have to go back and rethink my last paragraph.

I would imagine it is standard practice (it certainly is here) to remove a child who is to be interviewed re alleged abuse from contact with the alleged abuser, which, if the alleged abuser lives with the child usually means the alleged abuser leaves the house/is denied contact with the child until the investigation is complete.

If the reason for this is not obvious, I am happy to explain it.

However, where a parent/care-giver who is not alleged to have abused the child is considered likely to attempt to influence the child's testimony, then the child may be removed while the matter in investigated.

Given this is some sort of sect which is alleged to pursue practices which are abusive of minors, one would expect all or most adults within the group to be supportive of those practices which are being investigated, hence I would imagine this to be the cause of the minors' removal.

I haven't looked into the back and forth of this case, and I am aware both that removal is extremely traumatic, and that mass removals of this sort have proven very problematic in the past, but I do not know that removal, even mass removal, is necessarily an argument that the case is being mis-handled or is the result of some sort of mass hysteria.

Mind you, even IF abuse is being practised, in such sect situations, I doubt there is much chance of much coming out of the investigation, kids likely being too loyal/brain-washed/traumatised, or all three, to say anything much and all.

where you have solid evidence of young girls being mothers, being pregnant, suffering from mental abuse, having no (home)schooling, and being brainwashed by their religious fundamentalist old-geezer-husbands. Child abuse is not always evidentiary, yet if there is reasonable cause, the child(ren) need to be evaluated in a safe environment, away from the alleged perpetrators.

Fishin, do you know which standards of evidence, if any, the state must meet before it can separate parents from their children? Judging by the affidavit wandeljw posted, their evidence so far meets the "probable cause" standard, so the police can search and seize. I'm also pretty confident that they haven't yet met the "beyond all reasonable doubt" standard. So everybody on the compound is presumed innocent of any crime until convicted in a court of law.

What I'm not confident of is the thing in the middle. What standard of evidence applies before the state can (a) deprive parents of custody for their child, and (b) separate parents and children while it decides wheter to take custody from the parents?

While I'm not specifically knowledgeable about Texas statutes, most states (all?) have what is often called "Children's code" wherein such issues as custody/child protection/abuse/neglect are processed in a children's court or juvenile court which have a more lax criteria than "beyond reasonable doubt" and is usually "preponderance of evidence." From what I have read re this case, the procedure in effect is that there as been a prelim hearing and this will be followed up by an actual hearing of fact where both the state and the defendants present evidence.

Reporting
Rick Sallinger COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (CBS4) ― Texas Rangers were in Colorado Springs Wednesday as part of their investigation into a polygamist compound that was raided last week after a call from a young woman. A woman was arrested in Colorado Springs who may be related to the case in Texas.

The Colorado Springs police said Rozita Swinton, 33, was arrested for false reporting in connection with a February incident in Colorado. Investigators said Swinton had called them in February claiming to be an abused child being held in a basement.

A judge ordered the case sealed preventing other details from being released.

Officers said the Texas officials were there in relation to Swinton and her arrest.

There is no official word on what her connection might have been in the Texas case, in which hundreds of children were seized from a polygamist compound.

Someone claiming to be a 16-year-old girl called an abuse hotline in Texas claiming that her husband, a 50-year-old member of the polygamist sect, beat and raper her. Investigators in Texas have yet to locate the girl.

Published reports said Texas investigators traced that call to Colorado Springs.

The Texas Rangers would not comment on any possible connection to the Colorado Springs arrest.

Swinton was released on bond early Friday morning

So where are we in America when the authorities can rip peoples lives apart on the basis of a obvious false report?? How long would it have taken for Texas to figure out that the call did not come from Texas, thus they had no creditable report of abuse thus no legal basis for entering the compound??

This is the problem....

What you are describing is public prejudice, not evidence. It is not backed up by any real objective evidence(and newspaper articles and critics backing public prejudice does not count as evidence).

When you are a dealing with an unpopular group, public prejudice is easily confused with evidence.

I will point out that similar claims about abuse and "recruitment" of children were made against homosexuals. There were the same articles, the same "scholarly" books and even the same testimony from "ex-homosexuals".

I am not comparing these two groups.... but I am comparing the public reaction to these two groups; people are accepting hearsay and unproven claims as fact without questioning whether they even make sense.

It is important for people to step out of the mob and take an objective look; both of this group and of the action of the officials in this case.

When people are dehumanized, it is very easy to just see them as monsters. This is a very simplistic view. The truth is often a whole lot more complex.

ebrown, I did see an interview on CNN the other day, where a woman who
escaped the compound was explaining how the abuse starts with babies
already. They were physically beaten and hosed down with cold water,
in order "to break their spirit" as the fundamentalist leaders put it. She
proceeded to explain how very young girls are "brainwashed" to obey
their leader or they would go straight to hell. They - girls and young women - were physically reprimanded and emotionally threatened.
This testimony is coming from women who lived through this torture and
somehow have escaped this hell.

You could brainwash your children to clean your rooms, but I am sure
you abhor the methods to do so, as much as I do. You only can brainwash
children with forced and mental abuse.

Let's not forget that none of these children were taught anything but
religious doctrines in its simplest form: you either do as I say or you're
damned and rot in hell. Physical reprimanding does the rest to make
these poor souls like putty in those bastards hands.

By the way, on CNN you also can see a video when Larry King interviewed some of the mothers and wives from the Texas ranch. They are all
brainwashed to the point, that they all claim to never have seen young
girls getting married to older man (King's question). When asked, all
the women look down and say the same thing - to their knowledge they
have never seen it.

After you have seen this video you will understand that these children
cannot stay with their mothers. The abuse will not stop there.

Calamity, if what you are describing is true, that is physical beatings and use of a water hose, then this constitutes abuse and these kids should be taken away. (Why the word "brainwash" is useful here instead of just calling it "violent abuse" is an interesting question).

Teaching "religious doctrines in its simplest form" is not "brainwashing" (or if it is, then there is nothing illegal about brainwashing).

You should not confuse these two since. Parents who do the first without the second are criminals. Parents who do the second without the first are not.

A woman giving an interview on CNN is not enough evidence for me. I don't give much weight to the testimony of "ex-homosexuals" or even "ex-catholics". As the hoax phone call shows... people say lots of things on television. Many things being said are raising my skepticism.

If physical beatings are common in this community (as is alleged) there will be objective physical evidence. If this is the case, I will change my mind since all I am asking for is objective evidence.

It will be interesting to see if this is the case.

No, because TV interviews are not evidence. We'll be talking about evidence if the women repeat their testimony under oath in a court, as they may well do, and if the men they accuse provide unpersuasive testimony for their own side of the case, as they may well do, too.

13-year-old in sect may have child, CPS worker says
(By BILL HANNA, April 18, 2008, Fort Worth Star-Telegram Staff Writer)

SAN ANGELO -- A girl as young as 13 may have given birth at a polygamous sect's compound, a child welfare worker testified Thursday night at a marathon custody hearing for 416 children removed from the ranch.

State Child Protective Services investigator Angie Voss said that at least five girls younger than 18 are pregnant or have children.

Voss' testimony concluded an 11-hour hearing that ended at about 9 p.m. The hearing will reconvene at 9:30 a.m. today.

CPS officials argued that all the children should be kept from returning to the YFZ Ranch. But lawyers for the children said the state cannot make such a sweeping generalization about all of them and should determine their fates case by case.

During the first four hours of the hearing, only about 15 minutes of testimony was heard as a crowd of lawyers appointed to represent the children lined up to raise legal points.

At one point about 20 lawyers stood in the center aisle of the courtroom to examine a single document. As they examined it, about 30 women from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints sat in the courtroom in their old-fashioned prairie dresses trying to decipher what was taking place.

After each document was presented in court, it was then taken two blocks to San Angelo's City Hall, where more lawyers who were watching the hearing via closed-circuit television reviewed it.

Voss then began laying out the state's case for keeping the children in custody.

She said many of the girls told CPS caseworkers that no age is too young to marry and that it is their mission to have as many children as possible.

"There was a mind-set that when the prophet came and told them it was time get married, that was what they were going to do no matter what the age," Voss said.

Many of the girls were eager to begin having children and were thrilled to be living at the 1,691-acre ranch four miles north of Eldorado, she said.

"They said it was an honor to be there. They said, 'This is Zion,'" Voss said.

She has determined that girls as young as 13 have children, Voss said.

One 14-year-old and a number of 15-year-olds are pregnant, she testified.

Voss also described the circumstances of the April 3 raid on the compound.

She said she entered the ranch about 9 p.m. and was taken to a classroom.

Authorities were looking for "Sarah," a 16-year-old girl who had made several calls to a crisis hot line March 29 and 30. Sarah said she had been sexually abused and is the mother of a young child.

An arrest warrant named sect member Dale Barlow, 50, as the girl's husband. He was questioned by Texas Rangers in Arizona last week but was not arrested.

Sect officials first claimed that no one named Sarah lived at the ranch, Voss testified. Merril Jessop, the ranch leader, eventually started bringing young girls in for questioning by investigators.

After interviewing several girls, Voss testified, she learned that at least three teenage girls named Sarah live on the ranch and one of them has a young child.

But sect officials never produced the girl. After questioning more girls, investigators learned that Sarah had been seen working in the sect's garden four days before the raid. Voss testified that authorities still haven't located her.

As CPS caseworkers continued to interview girls that Friday, April 4, the tension inside the compound began to mount, Voss said.

Later that night, Texas Rangers told CPS caseworkers that they should suspend interviews because they couldn't guarantee the caseworker's safety.

Voss said sect members with night-vision goggles were perched in trees and on roofs. But, she said, she never saw sect members with firearms. She said she became more nervous when authorities moved a SWAT team and an armored personnel carrier into the compound.

"Things were getting very scary to me," Voss said.

The decision was then made to move the children out of the compound.
Initially, the mothers in the sect resisted, but Schleicher County Sheriff David Doran called Jessop and put the sect leader on a speaker phone.
Jessop told the women to let their children leave.

"They just stopped, and then they were cooperating," Voss said. "They even helped lead them to the buses."

As they continued to interview the children, caseworkers kept getting different names.

"They would give one name on the bus and another at the civic center," Voss said.

When asked if she believes that the children should return to the compound, Voss said they should not because the sect members do not believe they are doing anything wrong.

Earlier, Texas Department of Public Safety investigator Danny Crawford said investigators had found the "Bishop's Record" in the safe of sect member Richard Barlow.

The records detailed 38 families living in the compound and showed that one man has 22 wives. The records also showed that many men have underage wives. One 54-year-old man has a 17-year-old wife. A 46-year-old man has a 17-year-old wife and children ranging from 19 to 1 year old.

Crawford testified that it is difficult to determine which children belong to which mother.

The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints splintered from the Mormon Church when the latter rejected polygamy in 1890.

The group's prophet and leader, Warren Jeffs, has been sentenced to two terms of five years to life in prison in Utah for forcing an underage girl to marry an older cousin.

Since Short Creek the states have been working towards cooperating with the polygamy cults, while they can not legalize polygamy they can decriminalize it by refusing to put polygamists into the legal system. Texas has screwed this up for everyone, driving the cults further underground makes it much harder to protect individuals who are being harmed because they can not be identified, and they don't know that they have a way out. It had taken many decades, but this process was working for the most part.

Other events are also driving the move towards acceptance of polygamy, not only are increasing numbers of people opting for poly love relationships, but Islamics come from this tradition.

Polygamy has Arrived: Britain and Canada Pay Welfare Benefits to Polygamist Immigrants
"several hundred" men in the Greater Toronto Area receiving welfare payments for their multiple wives.

By Hilary White

LONDON/TORONTO, Ont., February 12, 2008 (LifeSiteNews.com) - Conservative analysts have long argued that the primacy of natural, monogamous marriage in the laws of western countries, such as Britain and Canada, is being eroded by mass immigration from Islamic states and the success of the homosexual lobby in re-writing the legal definition of marriage. And indeed, it has recently been revealed that in Britain and Canada, immigration and welfare rules tacitly admit that polygamy, which remains illegal in both countries, is one of the new facts of life.

If the adults have kids then it can not involve only adults. Many cults had gotten to the point that they would try to teach the kids that polygamy was the best way, but if the girls reach marrying age and refused to be poly they would be kicked out of the community. Very few I think are married against their will, though of course the choice they are given is a terrible one....agree or never see your friends and family again. Much more troubling to me is that the majority of the boys are forcibly kicked out so as to keep the female/male imbalance that allows for polygamy of the sort that is one male with many females. Males who very much want to stay are often not allowed to stay.

I have a great deal of trouble with how these cults operate, the majority through the state has the right to force these cults to follow law. My problem with Texas is that the state has played fast and loose with the law in order to get the results that they want, and they have operated with callous disregard for the well being of the current individuals within this particular community. When it comes to constitutional rights like due process and the states limited rights to search and seizure the ends that the state desires should never be gotten by means that violate the protections that we all live under. The protections are only as good as they work to protect everyone, no matter how disliked some individuals or groups are.

With your reasoning, ebrown, every child abuse case is prejudiced. Every time the authorities enter a home to search for evidence of child abuse, whether the tip came from a teacher, hospital records, a neighbor or wherever, they go in looking for evidence to back the claim or suspicion.
</quote>

What you say is true. But in what percentage of those cases are the children removed from the household while there is an investigation? And how many involve more than 1 or 2 children? In this case, they have removed the equivelent of all the children of a small town. That pretty much removes it from the realm of standard practices.

Re bolded.

I would imagine it is standard practice (it certainly is here) to remove a child who is to be interviewed re alleged abuse from contact with the alleged abuser, which, if the alleged abuser lives with the child usually means the alleged abuser leaves the house/is denied contact with the child until the investigation is complete.

</quote>

Just coming back to this thread so I'll address the comments that were directed to me.

I think we need to seperate things here a bit. There is a difference between seperating a child and their parents for an interview (or even multiple interviews) and seperating them for weeks/months at a time while teh entire investigation runs through it's process. We aren't talking about an afternoon interview here. The latter is what I was speaking to.

The stats I can find here for the State of MA show 46% of all initial complaints are screened out in any given year. The remaining 54% are considered to warrant investigation. Of those, less than 10% result in the child being removed from the home during the investigation.

I remember the sexual abuse hysteria in daycares, there was a very prominent case here in our town, however, I see no relation to this case
where you have solid evidence of young girls being mothers, being pregnant, suffering from mental abuse, having no (home)schooling, and being brainwashed by their religious fundamentalist old-geezer-husbands. Child abuse is not always evidentiary, yet if there is reasonable cause, the child(ren) need to be evaluated in a safe environment, away from the alleged perpetrators.
</quote>

I disagree. The evidence (as shown in the previous posts) are a telephone complaint which TX authorities knew was false the day after the raid (if not sooner) and a few 17-18 year old girls that are pregnant.

There is no "solid evidence" of the rest of this stuff. That's exactly why it conjures up the daycare scare where complaints were filed and investigations were conducted all based on phoney evidence - 99% of which was later recanted or proven to be false or unreliable.

I'll address the "reasonable cause" issue in a second...

Fishin, do you know which standards of evidence, if any, the state must meet before it can separate parents from their children? Judging by the affidavit wandeljw posted, their evidence so far meets the "probable cause" standard, so the police can search and seize. I'm also pretty confident that they haven't yet met the "beyond all reasonable doubt" standard. So everybody on the compound is presumed innocent of any crime until convicted in a court of law.

What I'm not confident of is the thing in the middle. What standard of evidence applies before the state can (a) deprive parents of custody for their child, and (b) separate parents and children while it decides wheter to take custody from the parents?

Texas Family Code, Sec 262.001

SUBCHAPTER B. TAKING POSSESSION OF CHILD

§ 262.101. FILING PETITION BEFORE TAKING POSSESSION OF
CHILD. An original suit filed by a governmental entity that
requests permission to take possession of a child without prior
notice and a hearing must be supported by an affidavit sworn to by a
person with personal knowledge and stating facts sufficient to
satisfy a person of ordinary prudence and caution that:

(1) there is an immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child or the child has been a victim of neglect or sexual abuse and that continuation in the home would be contrary to the child's welfare;

(2) there is no time, consistent with the physical health or safety of the child, for a full adversary hearing under Subchapter C; and

(3) reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety of the child, were made to prevent or eliminate the need for the removal of the child.

So all 3 of those conditions have to be met. The hearings that have been going on for the last week are the adversary hearings the law speaks of.

Court to hear Texas sect mothers' pleas to see children
(By MICHELLE ROBERTS, Associated Press, April 24, 2008)

A Texas appeals court on Thursday agreed to hear arguments that hundreds of children the state took from a polygamist compound should be allowed to see their mothers while the massive custody case is resolved.

The Yearning For Zion Ranch was raided three weeks ago, but many of the mothers had not been separated from their children until Thursday.

Two buses took the women back to the west Texas ranch from nearby San Angelo Coliseum, where the state had been keeping them and the children.

One woman held up a cardboard sign that read, "SOS; Mothers Separated; Help."

The women were moved out in preparation for moving the last of 437 children to group homes, shelters and residences, some hundreds of miles away, over the next few days. Buses earlier had taken 138 of the children away.

The 3rd Court of Appeals set a hearing for Tuesday on the motion from dozens of mothers to remain in contact with their children. State officials last week had ordered all mothers away except for those with children under 5.

After raiding the ranch, owned by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, state officials took custody of all children found there, believing they might be victims of physical or sexual abuse.

The move sparked one of the biggest child-custody cases in U.S. history, a case complicated by a tangled web of family bonds.

Experts and lawyers fear the children's transition to foster care may be much harder than it is for other foster children. They will be plunged into a culture radically different from the community where they and their families shunned the outside world as a hostile, contaminating influence.

Many of the children have seen little or no television. They have been essentially home-schooled all their lives. Most were raised on garden-grown vegetables and twice-daily prayers with family. They frolic in long dresses and buttoned-up shirts from another century.

"There's going to be problems," said Susan Hays, who represents a toddler in the custody case. "They are a throwback to the 19th century in how they dress and how they behave."

The state Child Protective Services program said it chose foster homes where the youngsters can be kept apart from other children for now.

"We recognize it's critical that these children not be exposed to mainstream culture too quickly or other things that would hinder their success," agency spokeswoman Shari Pulliam said. "We just want to protect them from abuse and neglect. We're not trying to change them."

Authorities say the FLDS church, a renegade Mormon splinter group, believes in marrying off underage girls to older men, and that there is evidence of physical and sexual abuse at the ranch.

The individual custody cases could result in a number of possibilities: Some children could be placed in permanent foster care; some parents who have left the sect may win custody; some youngsters may be allowed to return to the ranch in Eldorado; and some may turn 18 before the case is complete and be allowed to choose their own fates.

As many of us have stated, the problem isn't polgamy. I haven't read where anyone here has jumped on the "This place is bad cause they have more than one wife" bandwagon, nor have they condemned their religious beliefs outside of isolating / enslaving the women and making the boys leave.

The problem is child brides, indoctrinated from birth to not percieve freedom, choices, etc. To me, this is not much different from slavery in that they do not have a choice of leaving without being seperated forever from them family and friends, who happen to be the only people they know.

Also, we have laws as to every child being educated. Are they meeting the requirements? How can they without having to teach some things they do not believe? Science? History? Math? Are they reading Grapes of Wrath or other "classics" that a regular high school student would read that would also expose them to outside thought?

I don't have a problem with polygamy.

I imagine an in depth discussion of what is acceptable / not acceptable regarding raising children and what constitutes the states right to remove said shildren from their parents would be interesting.

Would you want children removed from their parents if they were only being taught magic potions, animal sacrifice and that the Devil is the only true authority over them?

What if they were being taught white supremiscist indoctrination, and to harm fags and niggers?

Where do societies step in and where do they stay out? Are children property that belong to parents or does society at large have a say?

The problem for that line of argument is that America has a consistent history of allowing groups to raise their kids in their subculture, for instance the Quakers and the Amish, however there have been many more. If the mass culture will not allow the polygamy cults the same rights then the question needs to be asked why. For sure the Polygamy cults need to follow child sex and child marriage laws, but as for the "indoctrination" not allowing the cults to teach their kids their way only would be a break from tradition. You need a good explanation for why they are not allowed the rights that so many other groups have taken advantage of.

No Sqinney, the issue is not child brides. I am fully against adults marrying, or having sexual relations with, children. I don't speak for anyone else... but I haven't seen anyone in this thread support either of these things.

You are clearly misstating the issue.

The question is whether public passion and prejudice are causing people to accept accusations as true without question simply because this group is odd.

If a (or even a substantial percentage) of the hundreds of children who were taken were in real, immediate danger of abuse... then I have no problem with this action.

I would also like to know that steps were taken to work with this group to help parents and children live within the standards of society without such drastic measures. It seems clear that if this is possible... it is much better for the children and families alike.

My point is that many accusations against this group are based on hearsay and attacks of their critics. Some of these have already proven false.

People who are odd have always faced prejudice which has often manifested itself through legal action.

I am only asking that drastic actions, such as removal of children, be backed with solid evidence and unbiased reason rather than fear and prejudice.

I haven't seen anything yet to indicate that they weren't being taught IAW the laws of the State of TX. There are hundreds of thousands of people that homeschool their children and many of them do so for religious reasons. They manage to meet the state standards so I have to assume that the children are being taught... enough. (I don't know what the state standards typically require)

What if they were taught that eating meat was bad? Or that not eating meat was bad? Maybe we could seize the children of people that don't believe in global warming?

One could take this to any extreme they can think of. But, IMO, parents are free to teach their children whatever they choose to teach them. I may not like it, but my option is to take responisbility for my own actions and refuse to support or assist them. Society can apply social pressure and isolate the offenders without resorting to government force.

But more importantly, there is no Freedom Of Religion if you can only participate in government approved religious actions. The seperation of Church and State works both ways...

What most American know about Polygamy cults can be summed up in the sentence "Polygamy, men taking advantage of women". The fact that the women claim to be happy, to have chosen this life, and to be fulfilled gets almost no mention. Polygamy cults don't agree with the conventional morality and views on the relationship between the sexes, and the majority wants to deprive them of the right to disagree under the sham argument "we need to protect the women and children from these terrible men". The women don't want to be protected, or be told what to do, or be told that they are backwards and wrong...they just want those who don't agree with them to leave them alone. But no, we can't do that. We bust up their community, take away their kids, and tell them to do what is expected of them if they want to get their kids back. That will teach them who is boss......teach them that they don't have the right to disagree with the majority.

I think that is a very false take on this.

As far as I have been able to research, while polygamy remains illegal, the authorities have generally taken the wise stance of ignoring it between consenting adults.

This is about whether or not there has been abuse of minors.

I agree that some of the heat here is because of prejudice against fringe groups like these, but in the end this case is about whether or not men in this cult have abused young women.

There are laws that ought, in my view, be adhered to re adults having sex with minors.

In such a group as this the minor girls might feel fine about older men having sex with them, if their "prophet" tells them it is ok.

However, they are NOT adults, and, while such situations are complex and it is very difficult to see the best course, investigating such allegations, where there seems to be some reasonable reason to believe crimes may have occurred, ought to occur.

I think where people are feeling that the home-schooling etc is problematic is because there is a feeling of discomfort that both children and adults raised in this sect have had little or no opportunity to be exposed to views not espoused by the sect, and that, therefore, whether even adult members of the group have been able to give INFORMED consent to the sect's practices is moot.

Personally, I believe that it is very negative for people to be raised without free access to a world view different from that in which one is being raised, and therefore that such self-isolating sects are extremely concerning, and places where abuse is at high risk of occurring (given the human propensity to abuse power, especially unexamined power....look at the abuse of kids in The Children of God, as just one example) but that is a very different question from that as to whether crimes have been committed against minors, and THAT is what the authorities are investigating.

Are you arguing that isolated sects ought not to be subject to laws against child abuse?

The idea that adult women are under some sort of mind-control where they are forced to do things against their will is a great story tale that makes things conveniently simple.

Texas officials believe another 25 moms at sect are under 18
(Associated Press, April 24, 2008)

SAN ANGELO, Texas (AP) — The number of children in Texas custody after being taken from a polygamist retreat now stands at 462 because officials believe another 25 mothers from the compound are under 18.

Child Protective Services spokesman Darrell Azar says the girls initially claimed to be adults but are now in state custody. Earlier they had been staying voluntarily with their children at a shelter at the San Angelo Coliseum.

The official number of children taken from the ranch controlled by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has been rising since a state raid three weeks ago. One reason is that some mothers under 18 claimed to be adults.

Roughly 260 children remain at the coliseum. The others were bused to foster facilities.

a. I am interested that you chose to quote and address only part of what I said.

b. Have you read what I said in my first post here re why children might be removed during an investigation? I also gather that investigators felt threatened prior to the removal.

c. You do not believe that some of what others see as abuse IS abuse, while I note that you are not especially supporting this sect and its practices.

Does this mean that you think there

should be no law re child sexual abuse abuse?

or

the laws should be changed? If so, how? In a way that has some effect, however imperfect, in protecting minors from adult sexual exploitation?

Do you see a way, re law generally, that the situation of minority dissent can be addressed while still having workable laws?

Lyndonville, Vermont - April 23, 2008

Lyndon State College Professor Janet Bennion knows a thing or two about polygamy. As the country's leading expert on the subject, she has spent the last 19 years researching and living with polygamous sects in Montana, Utah, and Mexico, and that's why she's disturbed by what's taking place in Texas.

" This is absolutely the wrong way to go about it. This is a group of people that are already against the government and the outside world, and then you get raided by state troops, kidnapping the children," said Bennion.

More than 400 children were removed from the sect's compound in Texas three weeks ago after allegations of forced marriage and sexual abuse began to surface. Professor Bennion agrees those crimes should not be tolerated-- but says Texas authorities should have intervened more cautiously, using a liaison to identify the children at risk.

"If you can establish abuse, of course intervention must be made, but use an intervention that doesn't break the constitution and that doesn't violate all these civil rights laws," argues Bennion.

I have no idea how you could possibly come to that conclusion after reading my posts in this thread.

Squinney's post was an intentional attempt to inject inflammatory rhetoric by labeling one side of the equation as seeing children as "personal property" in an attempt to slant responses.

My point was simply that making child "community property" still leaves them as "property". Once they are determined to be property does it really matter whether they are personal or community property?

Does this mean that you think there

should be no law re child sexual abuse abuse?

or

the laws should be changed? If so, how? In a way that has some effect, however imperfect, in protecting minors from adult sexual exploitation?

Do you see a way, re law generally, that the situation of minority dissent can be addressed while still having workable laws?
</quote>

I personally doubt that there are vary many exploited women in the cult, even the teenage brides who are having sex and babies with middle aged men. I personally have no problem with girls as young as 15 being married off. However, this is in violation of statutory rape laws, and while i believe that these laws should be repealed or emended I have no problem with the state criminalizing statutory rape in the cult just as they would anywhere else. And there is the rub, the state has not treated the cult members like they would anyone else. The cult members have been denied their rights and abused by the system, they have been steamrolled by the majority with law being used as the weapon of choice.

The lack of informed consent because some of the women know nothing but the cult and its ways is a good argument....the cult does need to change, as I have said. However, the Mormons and the later day polygamist cults have almost universally been treated poorly by the majority. I have a lot of sympathy for their desire to op out of American culture, for a deal where they ask nothing of the majority, take nothing, and are allowed to live their ways without interference. The majority has the right to say no to this deal, and has said no, but i can't hate on the cults even if they do violate child sex laws. I find much more to despise in the actions of Texas than I do from what I know of the Yearning for Zion cult.

Who knows, I might change my mind after the courts operate. I doubt it though, because Texas saying that it does not matter that the cult was set up by a caller from Colorado who appears to have an axe to grind with the cult is pretty darn low. The state argument that they acted in good faith is a crock, they could have quickly and easily have figured out that the call did not come from the compound. The state should have never come to the gate. Everything that has come after is a compounding of the original bad act.

The numbers are overwhelming. Over 400 children separated from their mothers at one time is hard to digest. I'm confident the state did not want to have to take such action given that most state child welfare systems are maxed out. Texas would be no different. If it were 400+ individual calls asking that abuse be investigated in 400+ individual families, the state would also have to react as they have.

Maybe it would be helpful to break it down that way to see that it isn't about hating a sub-culture. There just happened to be over 400 children in this "family." I can't believe Texas child welfare workers would want to take on this case load if there were other options.

As a world, we have to have standards. Some of those standards cannot be opted out of for any reason. Just as we do not tolerate female mutilation now that it is known to happen in some sub-cultures, (or canibalism or any number of other behaviors) we shouldn't ignore or amend laws to allow a sub culture to marry off little girls to old men.

Jim Jones wasn't a prophet, nor is Jeffs. Yearning for Zion or Heavens Gate... No different. Where does one draw the line on letting sub-cultures live the way they want to live?

My understanding is that this is not how it happened.....as I understand it, an investigation began, which is alleged to have turned up concerns about a number of minors, and that during this investigation the decision was made to remove all the children.

I am personally able, I think, to see all sides of this argument...and what I am struck by is the enormous difficulty of investigating fairly but thoroughly in such situations. Hell, it is excruciatingly difficult investigating and intervening in child abuse (especially sexual and emotional) in ANY situation.

I suffer in my analysis from being unfamiliar with the way things are done in the USA, or Texas. I see complaints from people that the state is too interventionist, and it is hard for me to form any kind of informed opinion re this and whether it is the usual child protection dilemma of "damned if you do and damned if you don't...and whatever you do nobody is happy", which is just the normal background for any child protection agency, or whether, indeed, the authorities in Texas have behaved unwisely.

The system here appears to me to be rather different from what I gather is the norm in the USA, but I find myself unconsciously thinking about this situation based on my knowledge of how things work here, for which I apologize.

Thing is, investigation of abuse in cults has, to my knowledge, often (if not always?????) gone badly. I would think that this is partly because of the enormous difficulties presented by the circumstances, as well as possible prejudice or lack of competence on the part of investigators, and possibly because there is no good body of knowledge and research about how to go about making such investigations effectively, and minimising harm while doing so.

This has not meant that some of the accusations which might have been deemed hysterical, and which did not result in prosecutions, were not apparently (judging from what many children who are now adult are saying about child abuse in cults such as the Children of God) well founded.

I think black/white arguments in this field are naive in the extreme.

There is generally no perfect way to proceed....there is more a least bad way to proceed, weighing up risks and benefits in the most balanced and rational way one can. I make no claim to know whether this was done in this case.

Taking children away from parents not alleged (with reasonable cause to believe the allegations may be well supported enough) to have abused them during investigation is an enormous step, with the potential to do great harm.

However, I think simply assuming, based on such imperfect knowledge of the facts as ALL of us here have (my view of the likelihood of really accurate media reporting in this and other complex alleged abuse cases, based on experience, is such that I discount a great deal of what is being written, but anyhoo) that in this case it is quite unjustified is as foolish as simply assuming that it is totally justified.

</quote>

I don't know that there is any pro forma.

I don't know how common such investigations are, and my knowledge does not include such investigations.

As I have said earlier on this thread, the principle here is that an alleged abuser (and here allegations have to meet quite high criteria even to be investigated) is not permitted contact with the child during the investigation. This is done to minimise the chance of the child being influenced by that person, and to minimise risk of further abuse.

Normally, this means the alleged abuser, if living or working with the child, lives elsewhere, or ceases to work where the child is (or is suspended from child contact work while the case is investigated).....NOT that the child is removed, unless there is only one parent/carer.

If both parents/carers etc. are accused of abuse, then a child would likely be placed, either with relatives or in care.

If a carer is not accused of abuse, but there is evidence that they would attempt to influence the child's statement about their partner etc, then again a child may be placed in care....but this is seen as a BIG step.

The principle is to cause the least amount of disruption to the child as possible within the limits of keeping the child safe.

In reality, as I said earlier, one just struggles with the least worst option..... there's little good anywhere in the whole damn situation.

That's if there is any investigation.

Currently, here, we have the child welfare agency so understaffed that even some Tier 1's (which is top priority) are not being actioned. And that's just the start of the problems, but don't get me started.

The body of law in most US states commonly called "children's code" is, at best, vague and generally leaves the evidence/criteria up to the courts to determine legitimacy of charges. This, I believe is intentional. On the other hand, in my experience it is far too common for children to suffer more trauma at the hand of institutional care givers such as foster care, group homes and residential child care facilities than they would have if they remained in the family home which elicited the abuse/neglect charges in the first place. As one 9 year old once told me "I'd rather be beaten by my father than by a stranger" It is, as Dlowan points out a thin line of judgement as to what is in the best interests of the child.
Don't get me started either.

For these kids being forcibly removed from their way of life and from the people they know as their parents is in and of itself trauma. We have full knowledge of this before the fact, because the kids removed during the last raid on a polygamy cult were studied in depth. Is is partly because it became clear that these kids were greatly traumatized by the state's actions that since that time until now states have refused to go down that road again. The state of Texas should have considered adopting the credo "first do no harm". There were other ways available to the state to get to the bottom of what abuse was taking place without traumatizing all of the kids in the cult. The sad fact is that the state officials simply did not care enough about these kids to consider other options, or moving at a slower pace, or studying what went wrong at short creek and attempting to avoid the same mistakes. These officials had it in their head that they knew best, and come hell or high water they were going to do things the way they wanted to do them. Procedures must be followed damn it, what they do to people is besides the point.

Children who are abused by their parents or other family members seldom want to leave them. It's the only home and the only family they have known and despite the abuse they feel loyalty towards them.

They are traumatized while living there, and they are traumatized when
removed from the home. However, if the parents cannot provide a safe
haven for their children, the authorities have to step in as advocates for
the children to make sure they won't suffer further abuse.

With a safe environment i.e. foster families and appropriate counseling,
these children have a chance to get through this trauma. Having the
children stay with the abusers, won't change anything.

The problem I see here in this thread is that the definition of child abuse
is different from one person to another. hawkeye, Thomas, ebrown and
fishin' are much more lenient towards the definition as wandel, dlowan,
squinney, dyslexia and myself.

Some of us are getting darn tired of loosing rights because someone says that we need to "protect" safety. Nothing is safe in life, but freedom is a darn nice thing to have and I for one don't want to give it all away in the pursuit of something that does not exist...safety.

Children who are abused by their parents or other family members seldom want to leave them. It's the only home and the only family they have known and despite the abuse they feel loyalty towards them.

Actually, I am more arguing from a rule of law basis. The law is clearly being broken in that compound, and I think bottom line is we need laws re this stuff.

I think this is an enormously complex situation, and I fear very much that the kids will suffer more trauma from the removal than from what they have been experiencing in the cult......(and, like DYS, I have enormous, sad, weary cynicism about what quality of care they may be receiving whilst in care..).....but I don't think I know anywhere NEAR enough to venture an informed opinion.

Personally, I abhor these situations in which kids are enculturated in some tiny, opaque universe, especially if their education IS only in what the cult wants them to know...and I think that qualifies as psychological abuse, never mind the sexual stuff, which is what people tend to get het up about and focus on. (Mind you, I am not saying that sexual abuse does not have extremely serious consequences).

But......my abhorrence does not abuse define.

The fallacy here is that foster care is no safer than where they were. Everyone would like to think that it is but if you read through the numerous studies from each state you'll find that on average, 1 in 4 children is sexually abused while in the State's care after being removed from their home and as many as 60% can expect to be mentally or physically abused while in foster care.

IMO, the difference isn't so much in the definition of what is or isn't abuse but in whether the State can (or should) remove children form their homes while they are trying to figure out if there is any abuse at all.

The State of TX standard requires the threat of imminent physical harm before removing the child. While I think sexual and physical abuse would certianly count in that I don't see how "they have weird religious beliefs" or "they repress women!" does.

Those other issues may very well fall under the category of neglect or be considered abusive but they don't rise to the legal standard that State has set for removal at this point. If those allegations are founded then the State can remove the children from their homes when they've proven the charges - not just alledged them.

This goes back to Squinney's earlier comments about whether or not "we" have a say. The people of the State of Texas created the law that creates the breakpoint for when "we" have a say in how someone else's child is raised. That standard applies to State agencies as well as parents.

Yes it is, but a lot of kids I work with, while disoriented upon removal, and highly traumatised by it, also feel immense relief and gladness that they are no longer being hurt.

As I said, there's not a lot of good in this area, but there is some least bad.

I guess my position all along here has been "I'm damned if I know how it should have been handled."

What I DO know is that I DON'T know nearly enough to either criticise or support the authorities. I am just thinking "thank heavens this cup did not fall to me."

One of the dilemmas is that people are saying the kids ought not to have been removed while the investigation was done.....and the media tells me the authorities attempted to investigate without doing so.

However, how is a child living with their alleged abuser going to feel freely able to talk about what has been happening in their lives?

For starters, one can assume they are very likely to be put under pressure, either implicit or covert, to say only what the cult leaders want them to say. It is hard enough for kids to talk about anything their parents/powewrful adults do that they feel uncomfortable with, without living with that parent while being asked to do so. Kids here are almost never interviewed while having contact with the alleged abuser.

I guess one possibility would have been that the men implicated were given alternative accommodation while the kids were interviewed.

However, from what I gather (and as I understand to be normal in such situations) ALL, or almost all, the adults are in agreement with what has occurred in relation to the children. Therefore, how likely is it that non-implicated men, mothers and other women in the group will also be influencing the children and what they are saying? Pretty goddamn likely, I would say. After all, they presumably believe that whatever has occurred is god's will, and what believer wishes to have themselves, or those they love, or at least have been taught to look up to, in trouble for doing god's will? (Which, as far as I know, it appears to have been back when this god....I assume it is basically the judeo-christian god they worship????....was first invented.)

Another issue seems to me to be a cost/benefit thing. Not to mention all the reasonable concerns expressed here re how we balance state vs parental vs children's rights in all this. Guess what? I don't believe we'll EVER be able to do that perfectly.....again we can only humbly and mindfully do our best to do what is least worst.

How likely is it that (except where there is physical evidence that adult men in the cult have been having sex with minors) any of the allegations will "stick"?

If such a massive and traumatic intervention cannot achieve any benefit to the children, is it worth traumatising them? (Remember, we do not KNOW if all the kids are unhappy being removed, by the way...some may be experiencing different feelings).

However, that would be an argument for never touching cults, and we know (or at least numbers of the now adult kids raised in them tell us this) that in some cults there is serious abuse with enormous effects on the kids who experienced it.

I am wondering if a lot of the expertise re what would be helpful might lie with the adults who experienced abuse in cults as kids.

I am also wondering if there IS a body of knowledge developing re intervention in these situations? Do you guys have any "experts" coming out of the woodwork and discussing what has occurred in what seems to be a rational and reasonable way?

I know I have no knowledge at all about good and well-supported practice in suchg a field.

Hmmmm...I am not surprised by Fishin's figure of one in four abused in care.......and that's terrible.

However, we do have reasonable (depending upon how good the initial assessment was) grounds to believe that four in for of those kids wer ebeing abused previously.

I think you'll find that orphanages were abolished in all countries that could manage to do so because the nature of orphanage care is intrinsically harmful (no real attachment figures, unless a kid was lucky just for starters), and because, given the human propensity for disturbingly large numbers of us to abuse power over anyone more helpless than us if the opportunity arises, they tended to be child abuse factories in far too many cases.

First of all, according to published reports the sect ran their own schoolhouse and every child was taught using the State of Texas's established home-schooling criteria (which requires that each child be tested annually to ensure they are actually learning the appropriate material.) I have yet to see any published report or claim by the State that the children were only taught using the bible (which the FLDS doesn't use to begin with so it would be highly unlikely).

But... which of those, exactly, creates the threat of imminent physical harm that authorizes the State to remove children from their home while the investigation is being conducted? To my knowledge no child has ever dropped dead within 48 hours because they didn't go to a math class.

You again rasie the question of standards but then want the State of Texas to ignore the standards they have. You can't have it both ways.

From this evening's NY Times:

"CPS officials have conceded there is no evidence the youngest children were abused, and about 130 of the children are under 5. Teenage boys were not physically or sexually abused either, according to evidence presented in a custody hearing earlier last week, but more than two dozen teenage boys are also in state custody, now staying at a boys' ranch that might typically house troubled or abandoned teens."

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-Polygamist-Retreat.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-Polygamist-Retreat.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin</a>

So that's roughly 150 of the kids where the State has publicly admitted that there is no threat of imminent physical harm - yet they all remain in the State's care.

CNN has "experts" on TV talking about the case, nothing concrete though,
mainly due to the absence of information from the authorities in TX.

Thing is, heaps of kids don't disclose abuse even when they are not in contact with the alleged abuser and where the practice of the interview process is excellent.

Just the way things are. I think some of you folks are operating under a belief that, if abuse is occurring in the sect, beyond what is physically manifest, it will be disclosed.

Oh, I mean they don't disclose where there IS abuse........as evidenced by what they say later once they feel powerful and safe enough to disclose.

At least here, where I work, there's almost always only one bite of the cherry as evidentiary forensic psychosocial interviews must follow the strictest of guidelines re not leading a child and a host of other factors.

There is only one preliminary interview to familiarise the child with the interviewer, and to assess the child's capacity re a number of factors (like language ability, concept of time, concept of lie vs truth, ability to identify parts of body, ability to correct interviewer when they are wrong etc. etc. etc,)

There is then one forensic interview, which is strictly, as I said, guided by rules of evidence.

Interviewing again, if a child discloses something after the forensic, only happens sometimes, if new material emerges, the expression of which also meets certain guidelines. Re-interviewing a child on the same material, unless there were factors which clearly rendered it justifiable, would normally be seen as highly questionable in court.

This is all supposed to guard against false accusations and other abuses, and I can see the point. The balance is tough. Personally, here, I think the abusers are better protected than the kids, by a wide margin.

Now.

In effect, if you're a little kid, and there's no witnesses or physical evidence, (usual in most sexual abuse situations), cases seldom get as far as court, and it's a matter of what the jury decide.

It's pretty safe to sexually abuse a little kid here, criminally speaking.

It gets less safe as they get older, but your chances of being convicted for it are still damn low.

When kids disclose in therapy, that is legally questionable, as therapy does not, of course, work in the same way as forensic interviews!

A therapist wise in the ways of courts, or just wise, does not, of course, ask leading questions, and, if you are well-informed, therapy disclosures may often end up being potentially forensically useful.......but most kids, if they disclose well after the event, will not be able to meet the strict criteria of being able to recall the date, the time of day, exact place, what they were wearing, what the alleged offender was wearing, what hand, finger/penis was placed where at what exact moment, what item of clothing was removed at what time, and where it was placed etc. etc. etc. etc.

I kind of get the impression that things are less strict in some places, at least, in the USA?

Anyhoo, I guess my point is that, even if systemic abuse is occurring in this cult, I wouldn't be holding my breath that it will come out.

Hence the importance of a cost/benefit assessment.

''There was a systematic process going on to groom these young girls to become brides,'' said CPS spokesman Darrell Azar, noting that the state had no way to protect from possible future abuse if they stayed on the ranch.

''Removal is always the last option,'' he said. ''In this case, there was no other choice.''

The younger children, under the age of 5, have been allowed to return
to the ranch with their mothers.

No, they haven't been allowed to return. I have no idea where you got that from. According to that same NYTimes article which is less than 2 hours old, all 462 of the children remain in State custody. Numerous other articles mention that the last of the 462 children were moved from the San Angelo Coliseum to temporary foster homes this morning.

That is, the will be separated too

<quote>
Adult mothers who have been allowed to stay with their young children since they were taken from a polygamous sect will be separated from them after DNA sampling is completed next week, a child welfare official said Saturday.

The only adult mothers that have been allowed to stay with their children at this point are those who are nursing.

Last I heard the state "hopes" to work out visitation soon, but I sure don't get the impression that it is a priority. I think that the state wants to let the mom's sweat a bit. Most have not gone back to the compound because they believe that their only hope of ever getting their kids back to not go back. Also, the plan was to have some of the kids up to 500 miles away.

[CODE]SAN ANGELO, Texas - The state of Texas made a damning accusation when it rounded up 462 children at a polygamous sect's ranch: The adults are forcing teenage girls into marriage and sex, creating a culture so poisonous that none should be allowed to keep their children.

.

Rod Parker, a spokesman for the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, contends that the state has essentially said, "If you're a member of this religious group, then you're not allowed to have children."

Attorneys for the families and civil-liberties groups also are crying foul. They say the state should not have taken children away from all church members living at the Yearning For Zion Ranch in Eldorado.

Church members said that not all of them practice polygamy, and some form traditional nuclear families. One sect member whose teenage son is now in foster care testified that she is a divorced single mother.

"Of course, we condemn child abuse and we don't stand up for the perpetration of that," said Lisa Graybill, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas. But "what the state has done has offended a pretty wide swath of the American people with what appears to be an overreaching action to sweep up all these children. "

In a sweeping indictment of the raid on a secretive polygamist compound in Texas, Aspen attorney Gerry Goldstein is accusing law enforcement there of reckless disregard, unlawful taking of DNA and he is demanding a review of their actions.

At the crux of the 39-page motion Goldstein filed Thursday in the Texas 51st Judicial District Court on behalf of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is a revelation that the man authorities were looking for, Dale Evans Barlow, was in Arizona at the time of the April 3 raid. Texas Rangers searched the polygamist sect's Yearning For Zion Ranch near Eldorado, Texas, for a week after receiving reports from a woman claiming to be a 16-year-old named Sarah Jessop who alleged that Barlow was sexually abusing her. Police, however, now suspect the reports were a prank engineered by a woman in Colorado Springs with a history of false reporting.

"Those officers could have and should have exercised greater diligence in verifying and determining the true whereabouts of a known convicted felon, serving a probated sentence in another state. At the very least, alleging that Dale Barlow was located on the YFZ Ranch without checking with the Arizona Probation Office, these officers knew to be supervising him, constituted a reckless disregard for either standard law enforcement protocol or common sense," reads Goldstein's request for a hearing to investigate the issuance of the search-and-arrest warrants.

The Aspen Daily News obtained the request in advance of its filing.

" Moreover, prior to executing the initial warrant, (Schleicher County Sheriff David Doran) was advised that Dale Barlow was in Arizona and not on the premises sought to be searched. In fact, prior to entering the premises Sheriff Doran actually spoke to Dale Barlow in Arizona by cell phone, confirming his driver license number and the fact that he was in Arizona."

fishin, so you think that the abuse stemming from other members living in the household makes up for the difference (1 in 4 abused)?

I am sorry, I might be naive here, but it's not that easy to a) go through the foster care system to become a foster parent, and b) to raise a
"special need" child. I want to think that the majority of foster parents
are in it for the goodness of their heart.

There is no statistic on the break-down of who might be the abuser in
foster care, and there isn't a break-down of figures how many children
are living with a particular foster family.

I sincerely doubt that the difference from 0.57 % to your numbers,
are inflicted by either natural or other foster care children.

</quote>

You make some very astounding leaps in logic...

The difference in numbers can come from several places. For one, the numbers used in the report the chart came from are only the cases that the state is aware of. Do you presume that the state is aware of and can prove every case of abuse committed by foster parents? Secondly, I pretty clearly listed "neighbors, etc.." as well as family members. Now, I don't know about your neighborhood but my neighbors don't live in my household. The entire concept of neighbors pretty much relies on them living close by but in a seperate household. If they live in the same household they're called "family", "roommates" or "housemates" - not neighbors. Third, it isn't unusual for a standard government reporting system to have very different results from independent surveys. The link I provided earlier listed a dozen or so various studies conducted over a 25 year period. Is every one of those studies wrong?

When I did my work/study with a State child protection agency one of the frequent (daily) issues that came up was foster children that ran away from home and ended up on the streets homeless. Those children (typically teens) were routinely sexually abused. Promiscuous behaviour amongst foster children isn't unusual (whether the child runs away or not).

</quote>

I wish to think the same thing. I'm simply more skeptical about it than you are and I don't ignore the reports of foster parents who accept children and then lock them in cages in their basements. As much as we all might wish that everyone was in the system for the complete and total purpose of improving the lives of these children, there are some that slip through that are in it for money or the access to children for "not very nice" reasons. And even those who are in the system for entirely nobel reasons don't have the ability to completely protect the foster children in their care from others that aren't so nobel.

Comptroller Strayhorn Statement
On Foster Care Abuse
Friday, June 23, 2006
(Austin)-- "In April 2004 I said I would give our forgotten children in foster care something they need - a voice.

"I have been and I will continue to be their voice. This Governor's Health and Human Services Commission continues to stonewall my investigation and this governor continues to hide the truth.

"In October 2004, I urged Gov. Perry to immediately create a Family and Protective Services Crisis Management Team by executive order to finally take serious steps to save children's lives. Now it is June 2006.

"Gov. Perry's failure to act is unconscionable.

"In November 2004, I launched an investigation into possible Medicaid prescription drug fraud and abuse in our state's foster care system.

"I am here today to release disturbing information found during my investigation about the deaths, poisonings, rapes and pregnancies of children in our state's foster care system.

"I found, from information provided by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, in Fiscal 2003, 30 foster children died in our state's care; in Fiscal 2004, 38 foster children died; and in Fiscal 2005, 48 foster children died.

"Data shows that while the number of foster children in our state's care increased 24 percent from 26,133 in Fiscal 2003 to 32,474 in Fiscal 2005, the number of deaths increased 60 percent.

"If you compare the number of deaths of children in our state's population to the number of deaths in our state's foster care system, a child is four times more likely to die in our state's foster care system.

"Based on Fiscal 2004 data provided by the Health and Human Services Commission, about 100 children received treatment for poisoning from medications; 63 foster children received medical treatment for rape that occurred while in the foster care system; and 142 children gave birth while in the state foster care system.

"As alarming as these cases are, we can only imagine how much worse the Fiscal 2005 data is because Gov. Perry's Health and Human Services Commission has refused to provide the data needed to complete my investigation.

"When I called on Gov. Perry in October 2004 to create a Crisis Management Team, I said the crisis was minute-by-minute and child-by-child.

"In Fiscal 2004, four-year old twin boys living in the same foster home received medical treatment in the hospital for rape.

"A five-year old boy in the same foster home received medical treatment in the hospital for rape two days later.

"A 15-year old girl who was not pregnant when she entered our state's foster care system in May 2002 gave birth in February 2004.

"The state is supposed to be protecting our forgotten children, but in all too many cases these children are taken from one abusive situation and placed in another abusive situation. Many children are in more abusive situations now than they were before the state intervened. Children are being neglected and abused and are dying.
"As reported by the media, a 12-year-old boy died in December 2005, while in our state's care at a facility that treats children with learning disabilities and emotional problems. The boy suffocated while being restrained from behind by an employee of the facility.

"Another boy in our state's care at the same facility died May 30, after drowning in a creek during a May 6 bicycle outing.

"A three-year old was treated for poisoning from an atypical, mind-altering antipsychotic drug. These drugs are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for children under the age of 18 years old.

"Gov. Perry's failure to create a Crisis Management Team is unconscionable. The crisis is minute-by-minute and child-by-child. I renew my call. He must act now to save children's lives.

"I discovered the alarming number of deaths, poisonings, rapes and pregnancies while conducting my investigation into potential prescription drug fraud and abuse in the state's foster care system.

"I launched my investigation in November 2004, after my report, Forgotten Children, uncovered the fact that large numbers of psychotropic drugs are being prescribed to children in the foster care system, even though, according to the FDA, many of these drugs are not approved for children and have serious side effects such as suicidal tendencies, diabetes, and cardiac arrhythmia.

"Since that time, repeated and continuing roadblocks and stonewalling have been encountered by me and my staff in attempting to secure basic and necessary data from the Health and Human Services Commission to complete my investigation.

"It has been 19 months and 25 letters, emails, meetings and phone calls since I first requested foster care and corresponding Medicaid data from HHSC.

"The Commission finally provided Fiscal 2004 data. But, 10 months into Fiscal 2006, we have yet to receive the Fiscal 2005 data, which we know has been available for months and months.

"In March 2006, I requested all of the same data for Fiscal 2005.

"The Governor's commission has repeatedly thrown up roadblocks and stonewalled my investigation.

"We have had a signed Memorandum of Understanding, drafted by HHSC, at its offices since May 2005, agreeing in the Commission's own language to the confidentiality of this information.

"Claiming confidentiality, HHSC to this day refuses to cooperate and provide the Fiscal 2005 data needed to complete my investigation, despite that the statute requires that they cooperate and the Court of Appeals ruled on June 16 that HHSC's view about the confidentiality of its records is clearly wrong.

"What I have found from the information that was made available should be and is of grave concern, but the picture painted by Gov. Perry's Health and Human Services Commission's secret 2005 data must paint an even grimmer picture on all fronts.

"The people of Texas can handle the truth. What they will not tolerate is Gov. Perry's callous indifference in hiding the truth and placing our forgotten children at high risk.

"On Thursday, June 29, my findings will be reported to the Medicaid and Public Assistance Fraud Oversight Task Force so there will be a public record of this neglect and abuse.

"With every breath of air in Carole Keeton Strayhorn's lungs, I will continue to be the voice for these forgotten, neglected, abused, and dead children.

"There should have been a Crisis Management Team put into action in October 2004. It must be put in action now to prevent any more neglect, abuse and deaths of our more than 32,000 children in our state's foster care system.

"Gov. Perry is hiding the truth. And in hiding the truth he is jeopardizing our forgotten children's lives. That makes me one heartbroken Grandma."

Give system time to work in case of FLDS children
(JIM SHIELDS, Opinion Essay, Houston Chronicle, April 24, 2008)

I spend my days fighting to save the lives of victims of child abuse, so I have a unique perspective on the turmoil of the past few weeks at the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints compound near the West Texas town of Eldorado.

The organization I work for and I have been very critical of the systems (child welfare, criminal justice and the family courts) that we taxpayers fund to protect our children. So make no mistake, I am not a defender of "the system."

That being said, I think that we all need to take a deep breath and allow "the system" to do its work. And I am very hopeful that the children of Eldorado will be well served this time because it is my experience that "what's watched, works." In other words, the cracks, or gaping chasms if you prefer, in our child protective systems will be closed because the whole world is watching.

Some are criticizing Child Protective Services (CPS) because it removed 437 children from an environment that the agency deemed dangerous.

CPS was doing its job. Our laws give CPS this extraordinary power because we citizens want protectors of children to have as few obstacles as possible to do their jobs.

In fact, CPS does not use these powers frequently enough. The inspector general of the state commission that oversees CPS issued a report a few years back that said that in more than 75 percent of the cases where CPS knows there is imminent danger to a child, CPS returns the child to the dangerous home.

Was there ample evidence in the FLDS case for CPS to take such drastic action as removing the children from their homes? In a word, yes. The system failure is not that CPS acted too quickly but that it took so long to act, knowing what has been known for years.

Polygamy and child abuse are crimes. No one doubts that polygamy has been going on. So far as I know, that crime has never been prosecuted.

Child abuse is a much more serious matter. Soon, the state's prosecutors will have DNA evidence to determine if underage girls have been raped, and prosecutors will be able to identify the rapist. We will see convictions and men will go to jail.

The emotional abuse that the children may have suffered will be another matter, but from my vantage point the emotional abuse is extreme.

What I have learned from recent research studies on the brain is that the body will poison the brain when a person suffers severe stress.

For example, a soldier in Iraq driving across the desert has to be on high alert because he does not know what is behind the next rock, bridge or abandoned car. I understand that pictures taken of the brains of soldiers under such severe stress show physical signs of brain trauma (not unlike the pictures taken when there is concussive trauma to the brain) that relate directly to emotional disorders.

Women who live with an abuser suffer from this exact form of stress. One minute the abuser is saying how much he loves you, the next minute he is banging your head against the wall. Never knowing when the explosion will come causes the body to self-inflict trauma to the brain.

I have learned from escapees from the FLDS compounds that "keep sweet" is code language for a very severe form of mind control. "Keep sweet" means to stifle all normal human emotions such as anger, fear, jealousy or sadness.

When one man has to control several women, this is a very effective command, especially when infractions are met with swift humiliation and punishment. Watching the FLDS ladies "keep sweet" in TV interviews makes my skin crawl.

This abuse of the women trickles down to the children in a very predictable way. To the men of FLDS and the outside world, the women of FLDS appear very docile and controlled. But when the women are alone with the children, it is common for one woman to brutalize the children of a rival wife. This is done to exact payback for a punishment or humiliation suffered at the hands of a man who was instigated by the rival wife.

The innocent children then have no way of knowing when they will be punished, nor will they have any warning. This is emotional abuse, and we know that this form of abuse has long-term effects.

Removing a child from her home is always traumatic and should never be done without careful consideration.

The flip side of that argument is that if errors are going to be made, it is better to err on the side of safety for the child. We will be watching as this process goes forward and all of us want to do the right thing. I believe that we will.

The universal opinion is that these kids come from a very unusual upbringing, but that is not necessarily abuse. However, because of their upbringing they are at very high risk of being abused once they are out of the cult. The charges being made against the cult are actually an argument for why the state should have bent over backwards to resist removing these kids from their environment until it was decided what should become of them. Their upbringing also makes their removal from the only environment they know particularly traumatic to them, far worse than the normal trauma of being put into the foster care system. Remember also that none of these kids thinks that they have been abused, the argument that they are happy to be out of the abusive cult (made by someone...Calamity maybe??) shows a complete lack of understanding of where these kids are emotionally.

The main flaw of the argument above is that attention will be very brief, America's attention span is that of a gnat. The argument that these kids will be OK in a system that can not protect normal kids worth a damn because of people watching betrays a complete ignorance of how America operates. In addition, people watching has not prevented all of the abuse these cult members have already suffered, and continue to suffer, at the hands of the state.

The difference in numbers can come from several places. For one, the numbers used in the report the chart came from are only the cases that the state is aware of. Do you presume that the state is aware of and can prove every case of abuse committed by foster parents? Secondly, I pretty clearly listed "neighbors, etc.." as well as family members. Now, I don't know about your neighborhood but my neighbors don't live in my household. The entire concept of neighbors pretty much relies on them living close by but in a seperate household. If they live in the same household they're called "family", "roommates" or "housemates" - not neighbors.

Pretty far fetched what you're saying, fishin. In order to justify your

When I did my work/study with a State child protection agency one of the frequent (daily) issues that came up was foster children that ran away from home and ended up on the streets homeless. Those children (typically teens) were routinely sexually abused. Promiscuous behaviour amongst foster children isn't unusual (whether the child runs away or not).

Again, children that ran away and were sexually abused on the streets
doesn't necessarily apply to kids/teens from foster care only. All children
out on the streets are prey to criminals.

I wish to think the same thing. I'm simply more skeptical about it than you are and I don't ignore the reports of foster parents who accept children and then lock them in cages in their basements.

I does happen, no denying it here, but the numbers are low compared
to the majority of foster parents who do provide a good home and
environment for special needs children. You make them out to be all
monsters, and that simply isn't true.

Well... when you begin with the wrong premise you end up with the wrong conclusion.

I don't. I am simply more optimistic about the foster care system than

There has been no finding of abuse, there has been a snap opinion that these kids are at risk. However, they are also at risk in a foster care system that can not manage day to day operations, to say nothing of this specialized highly problematic situation. Besides, what would be the risk of allowing them to remain in the compound for a few months while this is all sorted out with supervision by way of state workers on site?? The risk benefit evaluation that lead to the removal of these kids makes no sense based upon what information is public. We know that the state had a Jones for this cult, I am not willing to take the state at its word that it had cause, nor do trust that the state has been forced by the courts to document reasonable cause. The Texas courts are notoriously poor in administering justice.

I have hopes that Justice will prevail, which probably means these kids being return to the compound and the state being admonished by the courts, but the individuals have already been irreparably damaged by the state.

On what basis do you say it was a "snap opinion" they were at risk?

Of course there has been no "finding" of abuse...the matter is being investigated. That's what an investigation is.....attempting to gather evidence to see if wrongdoing has been committed.

What expertise do you have re whether children ought to be removed during investigation?

I have several times here explained why this might have occurred, explanations to which you have made no comment, but simply continue to state it was unjustified.

Is it your contention, for example, that by supervision in the compound, that supervisors ought to have been with each child 24 hours a day? Do you have good reason for believing that this would have protected the kids from INFLUENCE on their statements? If so, why?

The reasons I have discussed include integrity of the investigative process, and reports in the media that staff conducting the investigation felt threatened.

On what basis do you claim "irreparable damage" re the removal?

Just for starters, by the way, you are making exactly the mistake you claim CJ is making...assuming there has been abuse....only in mirror form...assuming there has been no abuse.

I do not ASSUME the removal to have been justified, but I have not seen you present a good argument based upon more than what appears to be a very emotional and fixed response to what has occurred that justifies your very fixed decision that it was not.

One state worker made the call, and one judge signed off on it, that is all. Plus the time line is well documented. I think that Ms Voss in her own words says that she made a snap decision, wholly by herself, and gives no reason why the taking of the children had to be done immediately.

The abuse on the part of the state is clear and convincing. Except in extreme situations Americans should not be taken into custody, families should not be forcibly separated, with out due process. Ms Voss gives as her reason for her taking away the kids that the community believes and teaches that girls should marry young and have babies early. She calls this abuse, but this is her opinion only. The law says that girls can marry at 16, so if they wait till that age and don't have sex with the adult who is their husband till that time then all laws have been followed. If the state is going to regulate marriage, and if the individuals follow those laws, then how can their behavior be unlawful?? In any case, before deciding that a communities belief system constitutes abuse and not allowing an entire community to keep their kids the justice system must be allowed to work.

By David A. Fahrenthold
Washington Post Staff Writer
Sunday, April 27, 2008; Page A03

ELDORADO, Tex. -- The ironic thing is that before the big sheriff's department armored personnel carrier appeared outside the Yearning for Zion Ranch, it was starting to seem as though America had finally figured out how to live with its polygamists.

For more than a century, authorities had alternately persecuted and ignored the groups practicing plural marriage around the West -- splinters from mainstream Mormonism, splinters of splinters. Mostly, they ignored them.

But, in the past few years, officials in some states have begun trying to bring these groups out of the shadows. They offered a deal: Marry however often you want, but don't marry children. A Supreme Court case on gay sex also provided unlikely help.

Then came Eldorado.

On April 3, Texas authorities raided the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints' compound here, then removed more than 450 children. Now, Texas seems headed for exactly the kind of wrenching, head-on fight that other states have tried to avoid.

Their case will ask: Does this polygamous group deserve a place -- and the right to raise children -- in modern society?

"The people in Utah and Arizona simply aren't doing it" this way, said James W. Paulsen, a professor and expert on polygamy at South Texas College of Law in Houston. "The idea of walking in and shutting down the entire group hasn't been tried in more than 50 years. And the last time it was, then it was an abject failure."

Things have quieted down now in West Texas, more than three weeks after law enforcement officers raided the Yearning for Zion Ranch. The sect's children have been scattered to foster care around the state while officials use DNA tests to trace family relationships.

Now comes a legal fight with a twist. The state will argue that the sect's children are at risk at the compound, but not because every one of them has been physically or sexually abused.

Instead, they will say that the culture of the church, which encouraged girls to marry and bear children in their early teens, was a danger to any child immersed in it.

"There was a pervasive belief that children having children was what they were supposed to do," said Patrick Crimmins, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services.

To those who study polygamist cultures, the crackdown seems like something out of the distant past. Something that, in the past, had reliably backfired.

In 1953, for instance, a raid on a polygamist settlement on the Utah-Arizona border ended with wailing mothers, a public outcry and the return of dozens of seized children.

After that, observers say, the two states often tried their best to pretend that these groups didn't exist. The polygamists usually returned the favor. "It was sort of a mutual-consent abandonment," said Terry Goddard, the attorney general of Arizona.

But, in the past five years or so, Utah has made an unprecedented outreach to the groups, sending out bureaucrats to their settlements and making an implicit bargain with them about the law.

"We're not going to prosecute people solely for adult bigamy," said Paul Murphy of the Utah Attorney General's Office. But, he said, the state will look aggressively for other crimes, such as welfare fraud and sex with children. Arizona has made similar efforts, trying to target individual violations of the law, not entire communities.

"They definitely were trying to open lines of communication," said Sarah Barringer Gordon, a professor of history and law at the University of Pennsylvania. "And they would very much like to have these people become integrated into the society." Still, Gordon said, in many cases the groups have been wary.

The atmosphere of openness was reinforced by a 2003 Supreme Court decision invalidating laws against sodomy. At a distant point on the American social spectrum, polygamists saw another implication: The police would stay out of their bedrooms, as well.

But then, on April 3, there they were.

In the immediate sense, the raid may have happened because of a hoax. Telephone calls reporting abuse at the ranch have been linked to a woman in Colorado with an alleged history of false abuse complaints.

But both Texas and the polygamists had been courting a confrontation. Under "prophet" Warren Jeffs -- now in jail in Arizona -- the fundamentalist sect seemed to be ordering more underage marriages. And a West Texas representative sponsored a bill in 2005 that set new laws seemingly targeted at polygamists.

Here in Eldorado, the small town closest to the compound, residents still say they're glad the raid happened.

"It's not legal, and it's wrong, the way they were living," said Rosa Martinez, behind the counter at her Rosita's Casita restaurant.

But legal experts say the case could easily become a quagmire. They say Texas has an unusual burden: It has to prove not spankings or sexual abuse, but the dangers of an entire belief system.

"Can they say with a straight face that's in the best interest of these children, to be taken away from their parents?" asked Ken Driggs, a public defender in Georgia who has done extensive research on polygamy and the law. "Does government want to get in there and say, 'This is a good religion,' or 'This is not a good religion?' "

Kenneth Lanning, a retired FBI agent who worked on crimes against children, said courts are likely to order that at least some of the children be returned to their parents. But how should the state handle that, if it has said the parents are part of a poisonous culture?

"You don't want to put it back the way it was," Lanning said. "But how are you going to leave it?"

In Utah and Arizona, nonprofit groups and government officials say they've already heard from other polygamous groups, worried that the Texas case may signal an end to their own detente.

Here in West Texas, the remaining members of the Eldorado sect have a more immediate demand.

"We want our children to come home," said Dan, 24, after a hearing this past week at the courthouse in San Angelo, Tex. He declined to give his last name.

Asking for your expertise when making statements that read much like fiats is not the same as denying your right to say whatever you want....I am simply attempting to discover whether you have any more basis for your statements than emotion and a personal belief system.

The latter two are all I can see at the moment.

I see no comprehension of the complexity of the situation in your writings currently (though I did see such previously, when you spoke of the need for the cult to examine itself) nor any openess to entertain the possibility of a view different from your own having any possible reasonable basis.

I have looked at your article, and I see no basis for your contention about a baseless "snap decision", nor that anyone is trying to interfere with the marriage laws...they speak of UNDERAGE marriage and sexual activity with minors, that is pervasive and constitutes risk of what is defined under the law as unlawful sexual activity.

You keep using articles that present a reasonably balanced view (as far as I am able to determine) as though they supported you, or you select from articles a small piece that seems to support you, or articles written by frank hired advocates (the one by the lawyer for the cult.)

Given that the judicial system is, indeed, reviewing the decision, as it ought, I can, again, see no reasonable base for your ongoing rather dramatic charges against the state.

I would be interested, if you care to discuss it, and IF my intuition is correct, what it is that seems to make this an issue of such personal importance for you.

I have done so, as has CJ.

If, as I may well have done, I missed your citing of what you consider to be an informed source, I am very happy to read it if you will cite it again.

Heaven knows, I am willing to see bad practice in a state which routinely murders people in its execution chamber!

"Meanwhile, some of attorneys for the children who have been coordinating the overall effort to represent the kids met with church representatives Wednesday night and Thursday on a possible settlement: for the men to leave the ranch and the women and children to be allowed to live there under CPS supervision.""

This is the option that I would personally have wished to see explored before this. I think it would most certainly have been explored here, as it fits best with how abuse investigations are conducted here.

Once again, though, it still allows for a lot of influence from the adults.

I have been searching for research on the net, and only found one article that looks really interesting so far, but I can only access the abstract, which is kind of interesting:

NCJ Number: NCJ 136680
Title: Investigations of Child Abuse/Neglect Allegations in Religious Cults: A Case Study in Vermont
Journal: Behavioral Sciences and the Law Volume:10 Issue:1 Dated:(Winter 1992) Pages:75-88
Author(s): V L Malcarne ; J D Burchard
Publication Date: 1992
Pages: 14
Type: Legislation/policy analysis
Origin: United States
Language: English
Annotation: After considering the general problems associated with the investigation of allegations of child abuse in religious cults, this article illustrates these problems in a Vermont case and proposes legislation tailored to investigations of child abuse in religious cults.
Abstract: Attempts by State agencies to investigate allegations of child abuse and neglect against uncooperative religious cults have proven particularly challenging, since the nature of these groups makes identification of and access to child and adult members problematic. These problems were evident in the investigation of alleged child abuse in The Community in Island Pond in Vermont. In the face of collective noncompliance with investigative mandates, Vermont authorities spent almost 2 years in unsuccessful efforts to investigate many reports of child physical abuse in the religious cult. Statutes that mandate investigations of child abuse and neglect, as well as those which permit the taking of children into State custody, should contain language that recognizes the possibility for abuse and neglect in a cult setting. Special attention should be given to the need for nonconsensual access as a last resort in situations where there is reason to believe the children will be removed from the jurisdiction and where other forms of access are unsuccessful. 18 references

I'd be really interested if anyone else finds something useful.

So now it's MY fault that YOUR evidence doesn't list abuses committed by people who aren't foster parents? Sorry, that's entirely due to your own incompetence. You can't pin that on me.

I don't have to justify my numbers. The links I provided support my contention. You, on the other hand, have a big fat nothing to justify your's. YOUR stats show proven cases committed by foster parents and only cases committed by foster parents. Now all you have to do is prove that there aren't any unproven cases committed by foster parents and that foster children never come in contact with any one else in the world and your numbers will mean something. In the meantime they show squat. I do notice however that you continue to avoid all of the other reports listed in the other link I provided. I guess those studies don't support your contenetion, huh?

Yes... your statisics... exactly ONE statistic from exactly ONE report that provides an incomplete picture. Of course, every foster child is isolated and never comes in contact with anyone but their foster parents right? Is that what you are tying to claim?

Had the matter been determined by the courts after due process such a thing may have been done, however Ms Voss was very clear that she did not think that the kids should be at the compound, and she felt that the kids should never go back to the compound. Her personal opinion and bias was allowed to rule that day, even though her ideas and plans may not be the best available. That is the inevitable problem when a state both gives the child protection agency broad rights to remove children with out due process, and allows individual agency workers carte blanche in determining the best course of action. Not all states are as backwards as Texas, when it comes to a whole host of things Texas is about as bad as America has to offer.

You can drop your condescending tone with me, fishin.

Nowhere did I imply that you said that all foster parents lock up the
kids in the basement. You're trying to play with words, a rather stupid
game.

Fact is: you said that " 1 in 4 children is sexually abused while in the State's care after being removed from their home and as many as 60% can expect to be mentally or physically abused while in foster care."

You have yet to bring a legitimate source for this, or do you think your
watchdog site is it? I question that in the same manner you question
my source given from the governmental child welfare/foster care. Yes
it is only one source, but what better source than the government entity
who is responsible for foster care.

I may be ignorant towards your claims, but I am never am ignorant towards children and protecting them.

OLD data but good enough to make the point, the number appears to be for all kinds of abuse, not sexual abuse:
<quote>
One of the most comprehensive surveys of abuse in foster care was conducted in conjunction with a Baltimore lawsuit. Trudy Festinger, head of the Department of Research at the New York University School of Social Work, determined that over 28 per cent of the children in state care had been abused while in the system.

Reviewed cases depicted "a pattern of physical, sexual and emotional abuses" inflicted upon children in the custody of the Baltimore Department.

Cases reviewed as the trial progressed revealed children who had suffered continuous sexual and physical abuse or neglect in foster homes known to be inadequate by the Department. Cases included that of sexual abuse of young girls by their foster fathers, and that of a young girl who contracted gonorrhea of the throat as a result of sexual abuse in an unlicenced foster home.[1]

In Louisiana, a study conducted in conjunction with a civil suit found that 21 percent of abuse or neglect cases involved foster homes.[2]

In another Louisiana case, one in which thousands of pages of evidence were reviewed, and extensive testimony and depositions were taken, it was discovered that hundreds of foster children had been shipped out of the state to Texas.

Stephen Berzon of the Children's Defense Fund explained the shocking findings of the court before a Congressional subcommitte, saying: "children were physically abused, handcuffed, beaten, chained, and tied up, kept in cages, and overdrugged with psychotropic medication for institutional convenience."[3]

In Missouri, a 1981 study found that 57 percent of the sample children were placed in foster care settings that put them "at the very least at a high risk of abuse or neglect."[4]

A later report issued in 1987 found that 25 percent of the children in the Missouri sample group had been victims of "abuse or inappropriate punishment."

Children's Rights Project attorney Marcia Robinson Lowry described the findings of the Missouri review before the Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families:

The most troubling result of the Kansas City review was the level of abuse, undetected or unreported, in foster homes. 25% of the children in the sample were the subject of abuse or inappropriate punishment. 88% of those reports were not properly investigated.[5]

"Meanwhile, some of attorneys for the children who have been coordinating the overall effort to represent the kids met with church representatives Wednesday night and Thursday on a possible settlement: for the men to leave the ranch and the women and children to be allowed to live there under CPS supervision.""

This is the option that I would personally have wished to see explored before this. I think it would most certainly have been explored here, as it fits best with how abuse investigations are conducted here.

</quote>

Had the matter been determined by the courts after due process such a thing may have been done, however Ms Voss was very clear that she did not think that the kids should be at the compound, and she felt that the kids should never go back to the compound. Her personal opinion and bias was allowed to rule that day, even though her ideas and plans may not be the best available. That is the inevitable problem when a state both gives the child protection agency broad rights to remove children with out due process, and allows individual agency workers carte blanche in determining the best course of action. Not all states are as backwards as Texas, when it comes to a whole host of things Texas is about as bad as America has to offer.
</quote>

I would be surprised if this were an individual decision by Miss Voss or anyone else. I would have thought that she was the court spokesperson for the department.

Are you assuming that it was an individual decision, in which case what evidence do you have, or are you arguing that it is normal practice for removal decisions to be made by one person without consultation in Texas? If you are arguing the latter, I would be interested to see what evidence you have for that as well.

Once again, I am not saying that you are wrong, but it is so utterly counter to all child abuse investigation practice that I am aware of, that I am not prepared to believe it without some evidence.

Note the use your the word "all" in your comment. Nowhere did I reply with anything in reference to that comment with anything about basements. Once again, you are fabricating things. The person playing word games here is you.

<quote>
Fact is: you said that " 1 in 4 children is sexually abused while in the State's care after being removed from their home and as many as 60% can expect to be mentally or physically abused while in foster care."

You have yet to bring a legitimate source for this, or do you think your
watchdog site is it? I question that in the same manner you question
my source given from the governmental child welfare/foster care. Yes
it is only one source, but what better source than the government entity
who is responsible for foster care.
</quote>

My watchdog site lists the numbers and studies where every one of their stats are found and it encompasses the full range of people that come in contact with foster children. Your "better source" does no such thing and says so directly in it's charts and data summaries. It doens't refute anything I've said because it only addresses a small subset of the foster care system.

But... here's the data from another study for you since apparently you can't be bothered to actually follow a link: From a study of abuses of children while they were in foster care in the State of IL.

Total number of cases reviewed: 292
Number/Percentage of cases where abuse was found while in foster care: 212/73%

Who perpetrates abuses:
Foster Parent 61 (29%)
Relative Caregiver 61 (29%)
Institution Staff Person 12 (6%)
Birth Parent 30 (14%)
Step Parent 1 (.5%)
Unrelated Parent Substitute 2 (1%)
Paramour 2 (1%)
Other Adult Relative 3 (1%)
Sibling 5 (2%)
Other Child 12 (6%)
Other Person 13 (6%)
Babysitter 7 (3%)
Not Reported 3 (1%)

Types of abuse:
Death (Neglect) 1 (.5%)
Sexual Abuse 43 (20%)
Physical Abuse 50 (24%)
Substance-exposed infants 0
Emotional Abuse 0
Lack of Supervision 46 (22%)
Environmental Neglect 3 (1%)
Other Neglect 4 (2%)
Substantial Risk of Harm 65 (31%)

<a href="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:fYvihsYpTCcJ:cfrcwww.social.uiuc.edu/pubs/PDF.files/knownow.PDF+Benedict+%26+Zuravin&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10&amp;gl=us">http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:fYvihsYpTCcJ:cfrcwww.social.uiuc.edu/pubs/PDF.files/knownow.PDF+Benedict+%26+Zuravin&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10&amp;gl=us</a>

Now, that particular study comes in at 20% for sexual abuse while in foster care which is slightly lower than the number I had stated. The 73% total abused is higher than the 60% I had given previously.

The number from YOUR statstic which you purport to be the total abuses was what again? Wasn't it under 1%???

I'll stick with my numbers thank you.

The difference in numbers can come from several places. For one, the numbers used in the report the chart came from are only the cases that the state is aware of. Do you presume that the state is aware of and can prove every case of abuse committed by foster parents? Secondly, I pretty clearly listed "neighbors, etc.." as well as family members. Now, I don't know about your neighborhood but my neighbors don't live in my household. The entire concept of neighbors pretty much relies on them living close by but in a seperate household. If they live in the same household they're called "family", "roommates" or "housemates" - not neighbors.
</quote>

Pretty far fetched what you're saying, fishin. In order to justify your
numbers, you're roaming around the neighborhood to find possible suspects that may harm children in foster care that are not added in the statistics from the government site.
</quote>

So now it's MY fault that YOUR evidence doesn't list abuses committed by people who aren't foster parents? Sorry, that's entirely due to your own incompetence. You can't pin that on me.

I don't have to justify my numbers. The links I provided support my contention. You, on the other hand, have a big fat nothing to justify your's. YOUR stats show proven cases committed by foster parents and only cases committed by foster parents. Now all you have to do is prove that there aren't any unproven cases committed by foster parents and that foster children never come in contact with any one else in the world and your numbers will mean something. In the meantime they show squat. I do notice however that you continue to avoid all of the other reports listed in the other link I provided. I guess those studies don't support your contenetion, huh?

When I did my work/study with a State child protection agency one of the frequent (daily) issues that came up was foster children that ran away from home and ended up on the streets homeless. Those children (typically teens) were routinely sexually abused. Promiscuous behaviour amongst foster children isn't unusual (whether the child runs away or not).
</quote>

Again, children that ran away and were sexually abused on the streets
doesn't necessarily apply to kids/teens from foster care only. All children
out on the streets are prey to criminals.
</quote>

Ah! More wonderful logic from you. 1+1=3! How is what may or may not happen to kids who aren't in state care in any way relevant to this discussion? You've dropped off the deep end...

<quote>
<quote>
I wish to think the same thing. I'm simply more skeptical about it than you are and I don't ignore the reports of foster parents who accept children and then lock them in cages in their basements.
</quote>

I does happen, no denying it here, but the numbers are low compared
to the majority of foster parents who do provide a good home and
environment for special needs children. You make them out to be all
monsters, and that simply isn't true.
</quote>

How is it that you come up with this crap? You know, you are usually a fairly intelligent person but for whatever reason, you've been extremely stupid in this discussion. Please point to one single instance where I have stated that all foster parents are monsters. For that matter, point to a single instance where I have said that a majority of foster parents are monsters.

<quote>
<quote>
Well... when you begin with the wrong premise you end up with the wrong conclusion.
</quote>

I don't. I am simply more optimistic about the foster care system than
you are, that's all,and that is in addition to the statistics that show
a far lower number of abuse, than what you have come up in your interpretation to include the entire neighborhood and the dog.
</quote>

Yes... your statisics... exactly ONE statistic from exactly ONE report that provides an incomplete picture. Of course, every foster child is isolated and never comes in contact with anyone but their foster parents right? Is that what you are tying to claim? Because that is the ONLY way that your one stat can mean anything. Your total, complete and willful ignorance is astounding.
</quote>

I've lost the thread of what the point of this particular argument is about.

I assume we all agree that there is a level of abuse of children in care that is unacceptable

I would also assume that we acknowledge that all, or nearly all (assuming the investigation and court process to be imperfect, and that some children are in care because of deaths or other unavoidable absence by caregivers) the children in foster care were abused prior to their being placed there.

So far, abuse-wise, kids are looking better in foster care than in abusive families of origin. Nowhere near good ENOUGH, but better.

I don't know who was making the point about kids running from foster care and ending up being further abused, or why...but I will point out that kids are usually very affected by abuse/neglect/trauma by the time they are removed, and many of them will be running away and getting further abused and generally having horrible lives even if their foster carers have the patience of Job, the wisdom of Solomon and the love and compassion of Jesus, Buddha and Mother Theresa combined. This is NOT denying in any way that some carers are abusive, but it needs to be considered in perspective.

The next bit of the perspective is the number of kids who remain in abusive homes and also run away/end up on drugs/prostituting themselves/dead/having babies at 13, and, sadly, also end up being abusive parents, and so on.

Of course, this is not the only aspect to the problem of removing kids from abusive homes.....but, I dunno, I guess I am just a bit lost about what you two are arguing about.

Can anyone remind me of how this particular argument relates to the thread?

It goes back to <a href="http://www.able2know.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=3210757#3210757">my earlier reponse</a> to her comment that " With a safe environment i.e. foster families and appropriate counseling, these children have a chance to get through this trauma." where I said that " 1 in 4 children is sexually abused while in the State's care after being removed from their home and as many as 60% can expect to be mentally or physically abused while in foster care." - my entire point being that foster care is not "safe" in itself. Children in foster care are still at risk of abuse at fairly high levels.

She did some checking and found one site where the number that came up was extremely low (under 1%) and claimed that my numbers were nowehere near close.

I followed the referenced source in her site and found that the data they were reporting was only for abuses attributed to "foster care staff" which is only one subset of my overall claim and provided a link to another site that listed several studies showing much higher numbers, etc..., etc...

She, of course, wishes to stick with her numebrs because they come form a government site. The fact that the government site specifically says that it is an apples/oranges comparison doesn't seem to be of relevance to her.

Child Protective Services caseworkers investigate reports of child abuse or neglect in order to determine whether any child in the referred family has been abused or neglected. In addition, caseworkers assess critical areas of individual and family functioning to determine whether any child in the referred family is at risk of abuse or neglect; and initiate protective services for children who need protection.

To determine whether any child in the family has been abused or neglected and is still at risk of abuse or neglect, the investigative worker may interview family members and appropriate collateral sources. At the end of the investigation, staff must assign a disposition to each allegation identified for the investigation. Dispositions include the following:

Reason-to-believe. Based on a preponderance of the evidence, staff conclude that abuse or neglect has occurred.
Ruled-out. Staff determines, based on available information, that it is reasonable to conclude that the abuse or neglect has not occurred.
Unable To Complete. An "unable to complete" investigation is one that cannot be concluded and assigned another disposition because the family could not be located to begin the investigation, or the family was contacted but subsequently moved and could not be located to complete the investigation or the family refused to cooperate with the investigation. CPS policy outlines several required actions the caseworker needs to complete with the "Unable To Complete" disposition.
Unable-to-determine. Staff concludes that none of the dispositions specified in [1 through 3 above] is appropriate.
Administrative closure. Information received after a case was assigned for investigation reveals that continued Child Protective Services intervention is unwarranted.
The worker must also determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that a child will be abused or neglected in the foreseeable future. There are two alternatives.

The worker concludes that the children are not at risk if
(a) no significant risk factors have been identified, and abuse or neglect has not been found to have occurred in the current investigation; or

(b) the family appears willing and able, through use of family and community resources, to deal with risk factors in their lives in such a manner as to ensure the safety of the child(ren) for the foreseeable future. If the worker concludes that the children are not at risk, then the case may be closed.

The worker concludes that the children are at risk of abuse or neglect if:
(a) the worker has identified significant risk factors, and

(b) the family appears unable or unwilling to utilize family and community resources to deal with the risk factors in a manner that will ensure the safety of the child(ren) for the foreseeable future.

If the worker concludes that the children are at risk of abuse or neglect, then the worker may recommend:

services to address the problem,
open the case for family based safety services or
file a petition to initiate civil court action to protect the victim.
Actions could include removal of the children from the home and possibly termination of parental rights.

I think they would have been better off if they had been returned to their homes.

For one thing, because of the environment they've been in, IMO, they are probably at higher risk for abuse than the average child taken into the system. These are kids with zero "street smarts".

If necessary (and again, IMO, it probably would have been in this case) the males over say... age 15/16 should have been told to leave the compound for the duration and Child Protective Services should have sent their people into the compound and kept people in there 24/7.

If the adult women were/are also a problem then I would have preferred that they remove ALL of the adults and from the compound and staff it with CPS personnel to monitor the children. I'd rather see the adults moved than the children.

IMO, the children should have been the LAST people to be removed. Given their lack of exposure to the outside world they would have still had famaliar surroundings even if all of the adults were removed. Right now they don't have either their parents or their homes/belongings...

Looks to me as though it is possible that one worker may RECOMMEND such actions.....but I am not seeing evidence that a SINGLE worker may actually take removal action alone.

I'm not saying they definitely cannot........but they would be very atypical if an actual action of such significance is taken alone.

Court action alone would need, I would think, extensive consultation with the department's lawyers etc.

Frankly, if a single worker had made the decision to remove these kids they would be professionally insane, even if they were allowed to. Anyone with the brain the size of a pea would know what a stir the action would cause and the most basic survival instinct would be telling you to consult widely and well. That is clearly not evidence that it DIDN'T happen that way, but your evidence is not persuasive to me yet.

There were clearly a number of people investigating and I think it a far more likely scenario that discussions would have been happening not just between the people investigating, but way up the chain.

Here, such crucial discussions involve front-line workers, senior workers, senior medical and psycho-social staff within the forensic medical and psych-social specialty services, and police, at the least...unless there is a critical reason to believe the child is in imminent danger of physical harm, or the child has injuries which the parents/carers will not consent to be treated/investigated....even then crisis discussions are normal, by mobile phone, at the site, with other workers.

In very complex cases lawyers would also be involved, if harm was not immediately manifest.

Not that this is necessarily how things are done in Texas, but it is more normal practice.

I think that is a reasonable position.

I wonder if it was considered? I would have thought so, but you never know.

A problem I can see immediately though, is whether or not staff would actually have been available to provide such a service.

Here, for instance, no staff would be available....unless you took them from all the residential care places where kids were currently being looked after, leaving those kids uncared for.

Here, again, to ask welfare case-workers to do it would mean critical loss of ability to investigate other alleged abuse (and remember, a lot of that is physically critical stuff, where children have injuries) plus god knows what happening to case-workers' own kids and a major industrial relations storm.

I have seen this happen in situations where a family of kids were removed and there was literally nowhere to put them....staff briefly did shifts in the motel where the kids were, until carers could be found, but it was a total nightmare in many ways.

We recently considered it in a case here....but there was insufficient medical evidence to justify it.

If it were logistically possible, it sounds like a possibly good option, though.

When I said "CPS staff" what I envisioned would be CPS staff supervising a crew of people. I would assume they'd bring in medical staff, teachers, etc... but they'd all be taking direction from CPS. They might only have one case worker there at night along with nurses, and registered care providers, etc... Most of what they'd be doing would be day-to-day care (baths, meals, cleaning, school, etc) so caseworkers wouldn't be needed for that.

As it is right now it has to be a logistical nightmare for CPS. They've got 462 people scattered all over the state that they have to track. Someone has to be tracking where those kids are, telling the foster families when the kids need to be at appointments (interviews, evals, medical, etc...), court dates, etc... Having all of the kids in one place would seem to be easier to me.

I guess it can get ugly either way. As far as I know there aren't any mobile "SWAT" teams for these sorts of things. They don't happen often enough to justify them.

I think that is a reasonable position.

I wonder if it was considered? I would have thought so, but you never know.

A problem I can see immediately though, is whether or not staff would actually have been available to provide such a service.

Here, for instance, no staff would be available....unless you took them from all the residential care places where kids were currently being looked after, leaving those kids uncared for.

Here, again, to ask welfare case-workers to do it would mean critical loss of ability to investigate other alleged abuse (and remember, a lot of that is physically critical stuff, where children have injuries) plus god knows what happening to case-workers' own kids and a major industrial relations storm.

I have seen this happen in situations where a family of kids were removed and there was literally nowhere to put them....staff briefly did shifts in the motel where the kids were, until carers could be found, but it was a total nightmare in many ways.

We recently considered it in a case here....but there was insufficient medical evidence to justify it.

If it were logistically possible, it sounds like a possibly good option, though.

In very complex cases lawyers would also be involved, if harm was not immediately manifest.

Not that this is necessarily how things are done in Texas, but it is more normal practice.

SAN ANGELO, Texas - A Texas Child Protective Services investigations supervisor who led the initial foray into a polygamous sect's ranch testified today that she had first consulted a psychiatrist who has done extensive research into religious cults and the sister of the Utah woman whose testimony led to the imprisonment of sect leader Warren S. Jeffs.
Angie Voss said in a San Angelo court today that she talked to psychiatrist Bruce Perry of Texas and Rebecca Musser. She is a former member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, whose West Texas ranch was the subject of a days-long raid earlier this month.

Musser is the sister of Elissa Wall, who testified in a Utah court last year that she was 14 when Jeffs arranged for her to marry her 19-year-old cousin over her objections. Jeffs was convicted of rape by an accomplice and sentenced to prison. He also awaits trial in Arizona on other charges of arranging marriages for teen-aged girls.

thereby saying that the goal is to bust up the cult, a position that the state bought into. Also why leaving the kids in place was not considered, though we are talking about a couple of months not a life time, so the position is nonsense. The plan should have been to allow the kids to maintain their current stability until such time as it was decided what to do with them, not allowing them to stay at the compound because it would allow them their current belief structure betrays how deeply the hate on the part of the "professionals" towards their "clients" goes. The goal is to rub out the cult, the "we have to save the kids" is a pretext. The state should not be in the business of taking out religious communities, which is why this action will hopefully be over turned by people of more sound mind than Voss and her crew of saviours.

She may or may not have consulted enough...but she certainly didn't make the decision all by herself, as you first said.

Again, you appear to be unable to grasp that the polygamy does not appear to be the focus....it is the allegation of unlawful sex with minors, and the contention that there is a culture leading to and supporting the disposition of young girls legally incapable of giving informed consent to adult men for marriage/sex.

Consulting means that others have a say, which is not the case. Voss talked to the people she wanted to talk to before deciding what to do, but she decided. The question is did she conduct do diligence, and I think that the answer is clearly no. There are state workers in Arizona and Utah who know a great deal about polygamy cults, and there are some in private practice who do as well, and so far as we know she did not talk to a single one.

I get that informed consent does not currently exist in a form that is strong enough to pass muster with current societal views. This is why the cult must change its ways (as I have said repeatedly). My position is that the remedy imposed by the state is unconstitutional, the process is unconstitutional, the methods unnecisarily traumatic, and that the state has used logic that proves that their goal surpasses "saving" the kids, it is to rub out the cult.

Polygamist sect gets millions from U.S. government
By Jack Douglas Jr., staff writer with the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram.
Posted on Saturday, April 12, 2008

FT. WORTH, Tex. _American taxpayers have unwittingly helped finance a polygamist sect that is now the focus of a massive child abuse investigation in West Texas, with a business tied to the group receiving a nearly $1 million loan from the federal government and $1.2 million in military contracts.

The ability of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or FLDS, to operate and grow is largely dependent on huge contributions from its members and revenue from the businesses they control, according to a former accountant for the church, and government officials in Utah and Arizona, where the sect is primarily based.

One of those businesses, NewEra Manufacturing in Las Vegas, has been awarded more than $1.2 million in federal government contracts, with most of the money coming in recent years from the Defense Department for wheel and brake components for military aircraft.

A large portion of the awards were preferential no-bid or "sole source" contracts because of the company's classification as a small business, according to online databases that track federal government appropriations.

NewEra, previously known as Western Precision Inc. and located in Hildale, Utah, also received a $900,000 loan in 2005 from the federal Small Business Administration, the data show.

The president and chief executive of the company is John. C. Wayman, identified as an FLDS leader and a close associate to Warren Jeffs, the sect's "prophet," who was convicted last year as an accomplice to rape for arranging the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin.

When Jeffs, who was one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, was arrested in the summer of 2006, he was driving Wayman's late-model red Cadillac Escalade, government officials say.

Wayman did not return phone calls seeking comment.

On NewEra's Web site Wayman says the company is "an honorable and valuable asset to our country" in helping build military and commercial airplanes that carry people throughout the world. He does not mention its ties to the FLDS.

Steve Barlow, human resources manager for NewEra, said last week that it would be inappropriate to comment, "Given everything that's going on. I could only give you the company motto: 'Good parts on time.'. "

U.S. Rep. Kay Granger, the Fort Worth Republican who sits on the House Appropriations Committee that deals with issues of defense, military and homeland security, said she is surprised that the federal government is doing business with a group accused of mistreating women and children.

"It makes me very uneasy," Granger said. "It needs to be investigated without a doubt."

To begin with, she added, federal authorities should look into NewEra's financial records.

John Nielsen, who worked for the company when it was Western Precision in Hildale, said in a 2005 affidavit that he and other FLDS members were made to work for little or no wages, even as the company was bringing in lucrative government contracts and other work.

At the same time, $50,000 to $100,000 in company profits were going each month to FLDS "and/or" Jeffs, Nielsen said in the affidavit, filed as part of a civil lawsuit.

He said he and other sect members thought their working for free or for extremely low wages would bring them redemption. Instead, Nielsen said in the affidavit, he was found to be "wanting" by the sect's leadership, ordered off the property and separated from his five young children and his wife. She was "reassigned" to another man, becoming the fourth of his six wives.

"It broke my heart," Nielsen said in the affidavit. He declined to comment when reached by phone Friday.

In Texas, authorities raided the FLDS' sprawling YFZ Ranch near Eldorado on April 3, beginning an exhaustive search of its 1,691 acres. Authorities were acting on a tip from a 16-year-old girl inside the compound who said she had been beaten and raped by a 50-year-old man whom she was forced to marry.

Since then, a state district court judge has ordered the removal of 416 children, many of them young girls who have children or are pregnant after forced encounters with their "spiritual" husbands in the sect's towering white limestone temple, officials say.

"There's a lot of bad shit in there," said a high-ranking official with the federal Justice Department who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case. On Tuesday, the Justice Department executed a sealed FBI search warrant at the ranch.

While the men of the sect have held close rein on their "plural wives" and children, seldom allowing them to associate with the outside world, the male leaders have fanned out into successful public business ventures. They work as government defense contractors, dairy farmers, engineers, construction contractors, log-cabin homebuilders and suppliers of lanyards, the cords used on eyeglasses or nametags.

In addition, JNJ Engineering, a company owned and operated by FLDS leaders, has made millions of dollars in Las Vegas, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported in September. The company won $11.3 million in contract work from the Las Vegas Valley Water District; all but one of the project workers came from the twin towns of Hildale and Colorado City, Ariz., where most of the sect's 10,000 members live.

Jethro Barlow, a former accountant for the FLDS whom Warren Jeffs excommunicated in 2003, said Jeffs ordered sect members, their families and the companies they operated to "give till it hurts....

"And people did."

Jeffs was able to rally church members to tithe heavily, even if it hurt them financially, because he had convinced them that they had to prepare for the end of the world, Barlow said.

The fever-pitched preparation continued, even after several apocalyptic deadlines had passed. It motivated the rapid construction of the temple at the YFZ Ranch and the erection there of manufactured cabin-like homes made by sect members in Canada, he said.

Barlow, who remains in Hildale, said he believes he and his family were kicked out of the FLDS because they were not among the favored ones in Jeffs' flock.

Although Jeffs is now behind bars, sect members still consider him their leader and prophet, said Bruce Wisan, a nonmember appointed by the state of Utah to replace Jeffs as manager of a the FLDS' trust. Established in 1942 to "preserve and advance the religious doctrines" of the church, it is now estimated to be worth between $100 million and $150 million.

Under Jeffs' direction, Wisan said, sect households are required to tithe at least 10 percent of their gross income to the church, plus an extra $1,000 a month.

Tim Bodily, an assistant attorney over the tax division of the Utah attorney general's office, said Wisan has received little cooperation from those within the sect, which has traditionally shown distrust for outsiders.

"He's been provided no records at all, and no one inside the organization has provided any inside knowledge.... It's a very difficult thing to do," Bodily said. "Progress moves slow when dealing with these people. Texas has its hands full."

(CBS) Contributor Ben Stein has polygamy on his mind this morning  and children.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

May I ask a question? What the heck is going on in Texas with the kids caught up in the polygamy ranch disaster?

Look, I am not a fan of polygamy. For one thing, it's all any man can do keeping up with one wife. For another, it's against the law in this country.

But the polygamists that have been in the news have been operating for decades. The authorities knew about it, and them. They didn't do a thing about it for all those years!

Then, on a totally unsubstantiated telephone call about sex abuse - which apparently did not come from anyone even connected to the polygamist compound - the state closed down the compound, and (what is totally incomprehensible) took the small children of the settlement away from their mothers and fathers.

Why? What crime had the kids committed? Why are they being dealt the most drastic punishment imaginable - separation from their mothers and fathers - for no known reason?

The state of Texas has not found one single crime against these children yet. Even if they do find one or two, how can that be a reason for taking dozens, maybe hundreds of children away from their mothers?

The kids are the victims here - not of the parents, but of the incredible, unbelievable cruelty of the state of Texas authorities. If there is evidence of cruelty by the families to these kids, where is it?

Look, I am a huge fan of Texas. I have many friends there and love being there. But what is the attorney general of Texas doing? This is an Orwellian nightmare. For no reason except what looks like a crank call, the lives of these children have been turned upside down and into a screaming horror movie.

Can't someone say the obvious here? That in this case, it's not the Mormons who are the criminals, it's the government of Texas.

Governor Perry, wake up and give those kids back to their mothers until you have some compelling, proven reason to do otherwise. What your state is doing here is Gestapo tactics pure and simple.

It will be a re run of Short Creek, when the citizens revolted against the heavy handed tactics of the state.

SAN ANGELO, Texas - An attorney for FLDS families in Texas challenged the state's allegations of a "pervasive pattern" of underage girls having children, saying the state's own documents show just three teenagers in custody are pregnant.
Of those girls, one will turn 18 in a few months and another merely refused to take a pregnancy test, said Rod Parker, a Salt Lake City attorney representing families at the YFZ Ranch. "That leaves us with one," he said.
Parker also said Friday that one state document includes a woman whose first child was born more than a decade ago. He said he based his statements on a copy of a list created by an investigator for Texas Child Protective Services. ". I challenge CPS to come forward with the pregnant minors," said Parker.
Investigator Angie Voss submitted the chart last week during a two-day court hearing to bolster the state's contention that all children at the ranch were at risk of abuse. The state removed 462 children from the Eldorado ranch, owned by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, earlier this month. The last children were moved out of the San Angelo Coliseum and Wells Fargo Pavilion on Friday. The children are now in group and foster homes across Texas.
The count of children in custody rose again Friday after CPS determined that 25 girls who claimed to be adults are actually minors, said spokesman Chris Van Deusen. That group may overlap with the 20 listed in the court document as pregnant or as mothers, he said.
"The only thing we can say is we're aware of 20 young girls who became pregnant when they were between the ages of 13 and 16," Van Deusen said. "That's not to say that there are 20 now, but at the time they conceived they were 13, 14, 15, or 16. "That establishes that there was some sexual abuse here," he said.
Van Deusen said the court document may not include minors identified as pregnant or mothers since the court hearing. He also said he could not talk about investigative results that haven't been made public in court or otherwise.
One CPS document reviewed by The Salt Lake Tribune lists just three pregnant teenagers. The court document, also reviewed by The Tribune, includes women who became mothers before the FLDS' move to Texas or before the state raised the age of marriage, with parents' permission, from 14 to 16 in 2005. The chart does not indicate whether the women are legally married or the ages of the children's fathers.
Among them: One woman, now 30, listed as having given birth to her first child in 1993 when she was 14. A reference to this situation was made by a CPS investigator without explaining when the pregnancy occurred during the two-day court hearing in which Judge Barbara Walther made her decision to keep the children in state custody. Parker said one CPS list shows some of the minors in state custody are or are about to become adults. One girl sent to a Baptist emergency shelter turned 18 nearly two weeks ago, he said.
"They need to let those people out," Parker said. Parker also refuted CPS' description of an orderly, calm separation of mothers and children at the coliseum. He said it was "complete pandemonium."
As the children, all younger than 5, figured out what was happening, they started screaming and CPS workers had to pry many away from their mothers. "This is inhuman. This is un-American," said Parker, who also said a civil rights lawsuit is possible.
He also said CPS assured nursing mothers they would be able to take breast milk to their infants but, as of early Friday, had been given no information on where the children had been taken. They also were told sibling groups would be kept together. Thirteen children from one family were sent to five locations, he said.
All the FLDS men and many women, some of whom returned Friday, remain on the ranch. "There is a real singular mind-set at the ranch right now to get these children home," he said.

What Did The FLDS Kids Do To Deserve This?
CBS News | Ben Stein

May I ask a question? What the heck is going on in Texas with the kids caught up in the polygamy ranch disaster?

Look, I am not a fan of polygamy. For one thing, it's all any man can do keeping up with one wife. For another, it's against the law in this country.

But the polygamists that have been in the news have been operating for decades. The authorities knew about it, and them. They didn't do a thing about it for all those years!

Then, on a totally unsubstantiated telephone call about sex abuse - which apparently did not come from anyone even connected to the polygamist compound - the state closed down the compound, and (what is totally incomprehensible) took the small children of the settlement away from their mothers and fathers.

Why? What crime had the kids committed? Why are they being dealt the most drastic punishment imaginable - separation from their mothers and fathers - for no known reason?

The state of Texas has not found one single crime against these children yet. Even if they do find one or two, how can that be a reason for taking dozens, maybe hundreds of children away from their mothers?

The kids are the victims here - not of the parents, but of the incredible, unbelievable cruelty of the state of Texas authorities. If there is evidence of cruelty by the families to these kids, where is it?

Look, I am a huge fan of Texas. I have many friends there and love being there. But what is the attorney general of Texas doing? This is an Orwellian nightmare. For no reason except what looks like a crank call, the lives of these children have been turned upside down and into a screaming horror movie.

Can't someone say the obvious here? That in this case, it's not the Mormons who are the criminals, it's the government of Texas.

Governor Perry, wake up and give those kids back to their mothers until you have some compelling, proven reason to do otherwise. What your state is doing here is Gestapo tactics pure and simple.

from what i understand, the MORMON CHURCH has distanced itself quite clearly from the sect.
using the term MORMON in this context is not appropriate imo.
why can't stein use the name this group has given itself ?
is he deliberately trying to link the mormon church with this group and confuse readers not fully familar with the sect and its aims ?
that seems a lazy way of writing an opinion - i'm surprised that CBS allowed it to be published in that way - perhaps they think it might boost their ratings.

I agree, but tecnically they are still Mormons, even if they aren't part of the main LDS group.

I wasn't agreeing or disagreeing with Stein, just posting another opinion. I do think removing children from families should be the last thing you'd want to do unless there was clear abuse.

SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Texas child welfare officials say more than half the teen girls swept into state custody from a polygamist sect's ranch have been pregnant.
Child Protective Services spokesman Darrell Azar says 53 girls between the ages of 14 and 17 were living on the ranch in Eldorado. Of that group, 31 already have children or are pregnant.

State officials took custody of all 463 children at the Yearning For Zion Ranch more than three weeks ago after a raid prompted by calls to a domestic violence hotline.

Child welfare officials say there was a pattern of underage girls forced into "spiritual marriages" with much older men at the ranch.

The law was that 14 year olds could marry, the law is now that 16 years olds can. Unless the state can produce kids younger, or ones that believe they were forced into marriage, the state has no argument. Arranged marriage is not an unusual practice, it has been done by a lot of cultures for a very long time, but America can outlaw it. Did we??? If the sect is currently arranging marriage at 16 years I think that a good argument can be made that no abuse has taken place. Certainly they should need to do the paperwork though, and I don't think that they have.

Texas law provides for a parental consent for 16 year olds to be married.
The legal age to marry is 18 years. If the father of a child is 20 and older, and the mother is under 17, the father is likely to be charged with statutory rape, which is "Sexual Assault of Child" in the state of Texas.

That is a legal gray area, yet to be clarified by the Supremes. This being the case it should not be considered grounds for Texas inflicting trauma on the individuals of this cult. You don't bust up ways of life and families with law that is not solid. Doing so is abuse of the law.

I'm sorry, but on this point I'm with Jane. How is it a "legal grey area" that no man can sleep with girls below 14, and that only partners no more than 3 years older can sleep with young women between 14 and 17? How do you suggest this violates the constitution?

The gray area is that one set of laws says that an adult can not have sex with child, another says that a child can marry (with out saying that the child can not marry an adult), and marriage presumes sex. The laws are at adds with each other, and the supremes have not clarified, because till now states have had the good sense not to prosecute these cases. We have not had a test of the law.

In any case the cult members were in violation of the Texas law that says that marriage licenses must be obtained, but i suspect that this law as well is open to legal challenge. I think that so long as a child claims to be church married to an adult that the state can not successfully go after the adult for crimes. The law is too weak. Texas very well might try, but I doubt it. They are going to very quickly run up against the conservatives, who will see such laws as an over reaching by the state into the sanctity of marriage, which they view as a religious institution. There will in short order be a polical price to play for using such laws against the cult, because those on the right know that any law used against the cult members are laws that can be used by the state against others.

Religious freedom is not the central issue, it is what is marriage and who gets to determine if two people are married. I assure you that the state wants no part of this hornet's nest, it is highly unlikely that they will criminally charge anyone. IF the state is dumb enough to do it this cult, with the backing of the religious right, will ride this case all the way to the Supremes.

SAN ANGELO, Tex. - More than 40 children removed from a polygamist colony in Texas might have suffered broken bones in the recent past, which could prove the existence of abuse at the ranch.

Officials with the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services said on Wednesday that their investigation has turned up some information about the children that is "cause for concern."

The department said it is also looking into the possibility that some of the young boys taken from the ranch earlier this month were sexually abused. Those indications are reportedly based on interviews with children and journal entries found at the ranch.

Officials did not give detailed information about the 41 children that are believed to have suffered broken bones, but apparently the suspicions are not based on medical evidence such as x-rays.

An attorney for the FLDS church responded to the allegations Wednesday, saying that there is no proof to support claims that any of the children were abused.

"They put that out as a bare statement, but they know in doing that... that the news media and public will jump to the conclusion that it's some sort of evidence of abuse," said Rod Parker, a spokesperson for the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS).

"They don't have any evidence that there's abuse, and neither do I," Parker added. "I think what's happening here is that Child Protective Services is doing what they have consistently done in this case... which is trying to grab headlines. They know it will be taken out of context."

Parker emphasized during a news conference on Wednesday afternoon that officials have even admitted that the suspicions of abuse are not supported by medical proof.

"There isn't a single medical report of suspected child abuse. The fact that no reports at all are filed is strong evidence that what is happening... is they are trying to grab headlines without any factual basis whatsoever," Parker said.

"I guess what I'm here to do is point the finger back at [child welfare officials]... and say, 'stop doing this,'" he added. "Stop grabbing headlines and start treating these families with some degree of respect."

Earlier this month, authorities raided the FLDS "Yearning For Zion" ranch in Eldorado, Tex. after receiving reports that a young teenage girl was being physically and sexually abused by her older husband. However, those allegations have yet to be corroborated and the girl who made the complaints to police has not been located.

Any kid I meet on the street "might" have had a broken bone during his/her life, it is rather common. My son broke his leg last year, so does this mean I can be accused of abuse if I am unfortunate enough to live in Texas??

I think that the state will not be able to prosecute if a 16 year old claims to be married to the man she is having sex with, and has a church document to that effect. A court might convict, but it will be a certain appeal. I think that the supremes would have to take the case.

So far the state has not produced any under 16, except to say that before the law was changed it did happen. If I say that 50% of those 14-17 have had sex, it does not mean that there are any under 16...it might be that every one 16 and older has been married off and is having sex. If the parents approve I don't see what the state can do that will stick.

None of the marriages has a license from the government, but as I said before I doubt that the state will get much head way on that angle either. There will be a political cost to making that argument that common law mariage does not apply to minors, one that Texas politicians will not want to deal with.

i'm sure the doctor/hospital attending to the child with broken bones at the time of the accident will gladly verify that it was simply caused by an accident or while playing sports.
i am assuming that it is the usual practice to have a child looked after by a medical professional for any broken bones.
i can't see anyone being accused of child abuse for bones broken while the child was playing a game in such circumstances.

Reminds me of the recent case in Washington or Oregon, in which a quite smart 14 year old (?) child of a Jehovah's Witness family came down with acute leukemia and refused a transfusion, and - would have to verify - the courts ok'd his refusal because of his knowledge and competence.

To me, there's a level of, if not brainwash, inculcation, going on, and I think I would have been for intervention based on age in that particular case.

It also reminds me that children of 13 or older are allowed in some states to participate in the decision of what parent to live with. Not sure they are the deciders in any state, but they get a voice.

Texas must deal with legal history, which has marriage consecrated by the church and registered with the state. States can write any kind of law they want, it does not however mean that they will be upheld by the supremes, which is where we are with marriage law. Maybe Texas will provide the test case in whether states have the power to regulate marriage that Texas says that they do, but don't hold your breath. I don't think that Texas is up to this fight.

1) The is no different than the statement "the state recognizes as legal only the marriages that the state has ratified", but that is not the end of the story. One needs only look at the movement towards recognizing homosexual unions as marriage to see that the law is not the end all be all of societal administration. The people have moved on what the definition of marriage is, the law changes only after the fact, it catches up. When laws are still on the books but are unenforceable because the public has moved then those laws go unused, because for the state to try to use those laws would result in the public taking its pound of flesh from the state by politically punishing those who over reached on behalf of the state. The is the line that Texas state leaders are now approaching.

At one time the church regulated marriage, then over time the state took over this role. However, their is no requirement that the state administer marriage. We are rapidly joining Europe in becoming a post religion society, so we are not going back the the Middle Age practice of having the church regulate marriage, but we can recognize as married any union where the individuals claim the marriage identifier.

2) as I have already said the constitutional question is that Texas law is inconsistent, they must either outlaw marriage of minors or not consider marriage sex rape if one of the marriage individuals is a minor. The cult can argue that the individuals did not seek a marriage certificate from the state because to do so would self incriminate them re the rape laws, yet by law the state would have had no cause to refuse to grant the certificate. The state can not write inconsistent law, and then pick and choose when to exercise each law, first saying that these cult members are practicing rape, and then saying that the marriage does not exist because there is no certificate. These individuals are in a no win situation, there behaviour follows the law in every way except to get the license, and yet the state considers their behaviour to be illegal and is resistant/hostile towards recognizing these perfectly legal unions.

Few answers in Texas
A month after raid on FLDS ranch, authorities have not achieved much resolution
By Nate Carlisle
and Brooke Adams
The Salt Lake Tribune
Article Last Updated: 05/03/2008 08:03:04 AM MDT

SAN ANGELO, Texas - On the one-month anniversary of a massive raid at a polygamous sect's ranch, here are the numbers:
* 599 DNA samples collected;
* 464 children in state custody;
* 16 group shelters caring for the children;
* One warrant canceled;
* No charges issued.
As of Friday, Texas authorities were no longer actively pursuing an Arizona man named in a search and arrest warrant that triggered the April 3 raid at the YFZ Ranch in Eldorado.
From the start, Dale Evans Barlow said - and his probation officer vouched for him - that he knew nothing about the 16-year-old girl whose phone calls claiming abuse led authorities to the ranch. The calls, to a San Angelo family violence shelter, now are being investigated as a possible hoax.
But Texas Child Protective Services said they found other evidence of underage marriage and polygamous marriages at the ranch, owned by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, that justified removing all 463 children living there. A baby born this week added to the total.
As events unfolded in Texas, Barlow remained at his home in Colorado City, Ariz. Texas Rangers traveled to St. George to interview Barlow but did not arrest him.
The Texas Department of Public Safety canceled the arrest warrant
for Barlow with little explanation.
"The bottom line is the warrant is no longer active," said spokesman Tom Vinger.
Vinger said he did not know when the warrant was canceled. He would not comment on whether the cancellation confirms the girl's calls for help were a hoax.
"We're still investigating that," he said.
The April 3 warrant alleged a 16-year-old girl called the shelter to report she was married to Barlow, 50, and that he was abusing her.
Two weeks later, Texas authorities announced they were investigating Rozita Swinton of Colorado Springs, Colo., who is suspected of making the calls. She has no known connection to the FLDS but does have a documented history of prank calls falsely claiming abuse.
Vinger said detectives have sent evidence regarding the calls to a crime laboratory and may wait for the results before taking a case to prosecutors. "We're known for being extremely thorough," he said.
Rod Parker, a Salt Lake City attorney representing the FLDS, said, "The cancellation of this warrant is just one more piece of evidence that this call was a hoax and the state of Texas did not properly check this out before they raided the ranch."
But Parker acknowledged the development has little legal bearing on the children's pending custody cases.
The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services said that even if the call was phony, investigators found a "pervasive pattern" of abuse that centered on young girls being groomed for marriages to older men. That evidence showed all children at risk on the ranch, the agency concluded.
There also have been no formal charges filed against Levi Barlow Jeffs, 19, who was arrested during the raid for interfering with law enforcement. Schleicher County Attorney Raymond Loomis on Thursday said he was still waiting for the police reports on the case. Jeffs is the oldest son of FLDS leader Warren S. Jeffs, who is in jail in Arizona.
No formal charges have been filed against LeRoy Johnson Steed, either. Steed was arrested April 7 for tampering with evidence during the investigation at the ranch. The Tom Green County District Attorney's office Wednesday said the grand jury that will consider the charge may not convene until June.

Caregivers blast Texas' treatment of polygamous sect's women, children
By Julia Lyon
The Salt Lake Tribune

Article Last Updated: 05/13/2008 09:17:24 AM MDT

Mental health professionals who helped care for FLDS women and children in the weeks after an April raid on the YFZ Ranch describe conditions and treatment they perceived as harsh and unnecessary.
"Never in all my life, and I am one of the older ladies, have I been so ashamed of being a Texan and seeing what and how our government agencies treat people," wrote one employee of Hill Country Community Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center in an unsigned statement.
Texas contracts with Hill Country to provide mental health services during disasters. Staff members met with the center's board of trustees last week, leaving them "spellbound." The board has gathered nine written statements critical of Child Protective Services.
Chairman John Kight said he wants state legislators and the governor to hear the employees' stories. "You have damaged these children for their lives," he said. "This is an agency that looks like it's gone out of control." A Texas CPS spokesman acknowledged the allegations were "very serious" and said they are being investigated. But he noted the women and children were held at a historic fort and a convention center in San Angelo in an unusual emergency situation.
"It was as comfortable as possible under the circumstances," said Patrick Crimmins. "But you have to remember it was a shelter, it was temporary arrangement until we could arrange for foster care for the children."
The raid was triggered by a claim of abuse at the ranch, home to members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a polygamous sect traditionally based on the Utah-Arizona border. A baby born today brought the total of children in state custody to 465.
Not all Texas CPS employees were criticized by the Hill Country employees. One young man was described as sitting for two hours comforting a toddler separated from his mother. The Texas Rangers were "respectful and polite," according to another statement.
But the statements focus on the Hill Country staffers' dismay at uncaring behavior they say they witnessed by CPS employees.
A boy estimated at age 3 walked along a row of cots asking for someone to rock him after he was separated from his mother, one employee wrote. Two CPS worker trailed the youngster taking notes but not helping him. His brother, age 8, eventually took the child into his arms and sat with him in a rocking chair.
"That little boy will always be in my mind," the employee wrote. "How can a beautiful, healthy child be taken from a healthy, loving home and forced into a situation like that, right here in America, right here in Texas?"
Mothers who initially were allowed to stay with their children were later required to leave if their child was older than 12 months. Describing that day, one employee wrote, "the floor was literally slick with tears in places."
After the separation, a baby was allegedly left in a stroller with no food and water for 24 hours and ended up in a hospital, according to another statement.
"We don't believe that's the case, but we're checking into that," Crimmins said.
Several of the employees stated they do not condone polygamy or the alleged abusive treatment of children. But, they added, the FLDS mothers were not silent or hostile, as CPS had warned they would be. Instead, they were polite, focused on caring for the children, and willing to establish relationships, the mental health workers said.
Several writers claimed CPS workers repeatedly lied to the mothers regarding where they were going to be moved to and other issues.
Crimmins said he disputed that. The state has asserted the FLDS mothers were uncooperative with authorities, such as providing inaccurate or changing information about names and ages.

SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- When Texas child welfare authorities released statistics showing nearly 60 percent of the teen girls taken from a polygamist sect's ranch were pregnant or had children, they seemed to prove what was alleged all along: The sect commonly pushed girls into marriage and sex.

But in the past week, the state has twice been forced to admit "girls" who gave birth while in state custody are actually adults. One was 22 and said she showed state officials a Utah birth certificate shortly after she and more than 400 minors were seized from the West Texas ranch in an April raid.

The state has in custody two dozen other young mothers and others whose ages are in dispute. If most of them also turn out to be adults, it would be a severe blow to the state's claim of widespread sexual abuse.

If it turns out the other 24 disputed minors are adults, the number of actual 14- to 17-year-old girls with children could drop to as low as five or six. That would amount to about one-fifth of the girls that age found at the ranch -- substantially higher than the average rate of teen pregnancies in Texas but a far cry from 60 percent.

"It's not widespread, and you've got to look at every family individually to determine whether there's a problem in a family," said Rod Parker, a spokesman for the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the renegade Mormon sect that runs the ranch.

"There's no reluctance on our part to go ahead and take appropriate action if and when we can determine these are adults," said Patrick Crimmins, a spokesman for Child Protective Services. "We are working as quickly as possible to sort this out and realize the urgency."

All 463 of the children removed from the Yearning for Zion Ranch have been in state custody for six weeks and are scattered in foster care facilities around the state.

Crimmins said he's not sure how long it will take to resolve the disputed-minor cases. Child Protective Services has complained that sect members refused to cooperate with their investigation, constantly changing answers or refusing answers to questions about age and parentage.

Parker said the state ignored evidence the young mothers presented, including birth certificates and Social Security cards. He said that with their long braided hair, makeup-free faces and pioneer dresses, the women look very young.

Patricia Matassarin, Jessop's attorney, questioned how a person proves her age if officials won't believe a birth certificate or driver's license, which Jessop also gave the state.

"The issue is how does anyone prove the date of their birth? We don't get a date stamp when we're born," Matassarin said.

A birth certificate combined with testimony from Jessop's mother were presented, and state officials conceded in Austin on Thursday that Jessop is an adult.

Crimmins said many of the sect members whose ages are in dispute don't have documents typically used to establish age, like birth certificates, driver's licenses or public school records. The FLDS children were home-schooled.

"We've been trying, sometimes with very little success, to get as much information as possible on the children," he said. "What we've said is consistent. We think there was some abuse -- some physical abuse and some sexual abuse -- at the ranch. This ranch was considered as a very large household."

The children are being treated the same as siblings of abused children in smaller households, where removal is common, Crimmins said.

The FLDS case is one of the most complicated custody cases in U.S. history, but all the children from the ranch were sent to foster care after state District Judge Barbara Walther found they were being abused or were at risk for abuse because adults were pushing underage girls into sex and marriage with older men.

In Texas, girls who are younger than 17 generally cannot consent to sex with adult men.

No one has been arrested or charged in the case.

All the children are scheduled to have hearings in the next three weeks to determine what steps their parents will need to take to regain custody.

The FLDS, which teaches that polygamy brings glorification in heaven, broke away from the mainline Mormon church, which disavowed polygamy more than a century ago.

Sect leader Warren Jeffs, who is revered as a prophet, has been sentenced to prison in Utah for being an accomplice to rape in arranging a marriage of a 14-year-old follower to her 19-year-old cousin. He is awaiting trial in Arizona, where he is charged as an accomplice with four counts each of incest and sexual conduct.

Jeffs' lawyers want the incest counts dropped, arguing that prosecutors in Mohave County cannot pursue those charges along with the sexual conduct counts. A judge is considering the request

But also on Tuesday, two cases came up that revealed girls as young as 15 and 16 had been unified in spiritual marriages with older men.

One of those girls, now 19, was ruled an adult by the courts but not before she said in a conference call to the court that she could have been no older than 16 when her daughter was born on Aug. 19, 2005.

And in another courtroom, information gleaned from the records of a 17-year-old indicated she had to have been 15 when her first child was born.

Crimmins denied any suggestion that the agency's massive case may be on the verge of collapse, adding, "The numbers aren't important to us."

What is important, he said, is that the children that were purportedly abused are now safe and protected. He said CPS was stymied by conflicting and false information given by families, which made establishing ages nearly impossible.

He added that his agency never intentionally misled anyone when it said it believed it had more than two dozen females who were being sexually abused as minors.

Hmmm... come to think of it, I have a question: On what evidence does state authorities base its claims about how old the mothers are? Did they obtain birth certificates? (This strikes me as unlikely in isolated sects such as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints.) Did the officials just guess, based on how old the mothers looked? If that's how it worked, the state's actions come pretty close to defamation.

Does anybody know how the alleged mothers' alleged ages were established?

((just to make my point clear))

It is prejudice (by the very definition of prejudice) to say that any of these kids were forced to have sex.

So far... the specific claims have been proven false. Did you read about the 27 year old woman who was put into foster care?

Prejudice makes people believe and do irrational things.

I am not willing to accept with out examination the state's claim that religious beliefs can equal coercion which can equal force. To me the state's logic borders on a violation of the separation between church and state. The state is claiming powers over cultural practices that if allowed gives the state the power to regulate religion. This is not a road we should want to go down. If the cult girls did not marry before the age of consent to marriage with parental permission laws state was legal then the community did not violate any laws. If the community wishes to promote a culture that has that girls should marry as early as legally possible, and if there are no laws against marrying much older men, and if there are no laws against having a baby when at 16, then the state has no cause to give these people grief. The state does not dictate personal values, nor community values.

The actions of the state of Texas, as well as the logic of the arguments used by Texas officials, are outrageous so long as the Constitution is in force and this nation still claims the Declaration of Independence as a guiding document.

My position is in between Edgar and Hawkeye.

If the State, acting rationally (based on evidence) and without prejudice, has good reason to believe that these kids are in danger of being mistreated, then the State has the right and the responsibility to intervene.

This intervention should be done in way that minimizes the trauma to children and families as much as possible... and respects civil rights as much as possible.

My fears are this...

1) The State's actions were based on public emotions-- fear and prejudice, rather than reason.

2) The State's actions were excessive and harmful. The stated goals (the protection of the children) would have been much better served if it weren't for the environment of fear and prejudice clearly surrounding this case.

3) The number of things the State got wrong-- from the ages of women, to the existence of cyanide, are frightening.

4) The damage to community, civil rights and to the children they are allegedly trying to save-- are shameful.

If the State acted on reason and evidence rather than hysteria... the outcome would be much better for all involved.

Prejudice is Prejudice... and the willingness of both the State and the public to jump to tragic conclusions that are clearly untrue is astounding.

Oddly enough, I did understand ebrown to be saying what he says to have been saying. (Grammar?)

You may be missing a piece of the puzzle here that is quite specific to the United States. When conservative politicians here argue against gay marriage etc., they often quote "studies", usually from wingnut think tanks, providing "evidence" that gay couples are more likely to abuse children and do other abhorrent things. The findings would be a valid argument against having the state recognize gay marriages, civil unions and the like, if the studies were sound. But for all I can tell, they are not. Every time I looked at one of them, the statistics turned out to be blighted with amateur errors that a janitor could catch after reading "Statistics for Dummies".

Compare that to what's happening in Texas these days. As soon as the courts started applying some scrutiny to what the state of Texas did in this case, it turned out that at least one of the "underage mothers" was not a mother, nor even pregnant. Numerous other "underage mothers" turned out not to be underage. It seems unclear how much of the government's case will survive, because according to (somewhat conflicting) accounts I saw on TV, Texas accuses the sect of (a) not getting birth certificates for their babies, and (b) being willing and able to fake birth certificates to make the brides seem older than they are. My interpretation -- which may or may not be sound -- is that Texas's assertions about the mothers' ages is grounded primarily in some field officers' guesses, based on how young the women looked to them.

It is a farce that Texas would sack hundreds of children, wholesale, without a shadow of due process, based on this evidence. The farce would have been transparent to everyone who has read "Evidence for Dummies", if there is such a book. The fact that it happened anyway is quite comparable to the "studies" about all those horrible things that gay couples are "more likely than" straight couples to be doing.

Neither I nor ebrown are saying that homosexuality and sex with minors are the same thing. But there is a hysteric reaction to both in the general American public, which is quite similar, quite disconnected to the merits of each case. And in both cases, state executives who should know better are catering to this hysteria.

I don't think we should want to go down the road you are leading to here either.

What happens when someone's "religious practices" includes human sacrifices? Should the state not intervene to stop a murder from happening?

Court: Texas Had No Right to Seize Children at Polygamist Ranch

By William Branigin
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, May 22, 2008; 5:00 PM

A Texas appeals court ruled today that state child welfare authorities had no right to seize dozens of children living at the ranch of a polygamist religious sect, saying they were in no immediate danger of abuse.

The 3rd Court of Appeals in Austin ruled in favor of 48 mothers seeking the return of more than 130 children who had been living at a ranch near Eldorado, Tex., associated with the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

An attorney for the women said the ruling is likely to become a precedent for other mothers seeking the return of the 468 children in all who were taken from the ranch last month by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services.

Texas authorities launched a week-long raid on the 1,700-acre Yearning for Zion ranch starting April 3 after receiving an anonymous tip that underage girls were being forced to marry older men and bear children. Under Texas law, girls younger than 16 are not allowed to marry, even with their parents' permission.

In its ruling, the appeals court directed a district court to vacate its temporary orders granting custody of the children to the Department of Family and Protective Services. The department can appeal the decision, however, and attorneys for the mothers said it was not immediately clear when they might be reunited with their children.

"It's a great day for families in Texas," said Julie Balovich, an attorney with Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, which represents the 48 mothers in the case. "It's a great day for justice in Texas."

She told reporters that the appeals court decision gives the trial court 10 days to comply. The decision "covers only the mothers we represent," Balovich said. Ultimately, however, "I believe that it's going to apply to all the children and all the mothers," she said.

"The fact that the court would rule this way provides a lot of hope for all the other mothers as well," said Cynthia Martinez, a spokeswoman for the legal aid group. "There's a legal argument they can work with."

In its nine-page ruling, the 3rd Court of Appeals said the Department of Family and Protective Services had failed to prove that there was any danger to the physical health and safety of the children of 38 mothers, that there was any urgent or immediate need to take custody of the children or that it made any reasonable efforts to avoid the removal. Ten other mothers and their children were covered by a second opinion from the court today, Martinez said.

The ruling harshly criticized the department's rationale for acting in the case and refuted the evidence it presented. It said the only danger identified by the department to the prepubescent children was a "pervasive belief system" at the ranch that the department said groomed boys to be perpetrators of sexual abuse later in life and taught the girls to submit to sexual abuse after reaching puberty

A long history of eliding detailed legal rules and procedures is the reason we've yet to see a single trial end in a conviction at Guantanamo Bay. Let's hope it will not now prove the reason we don't see a single conviction at the Yearning for Zion Ranch.

That's not how the rule of law works. The way it works is that people are presumed innocent until proven guilty of a crime. Child abuse is a crime. Therefore it was up to Texas to prove that the children in this lawsuit were victims of it. The court found that the state didn't carry its burden of proof.

So justice has been served by the court's decision. The only thing that hasn't been served is your unjust and bigoted demand that fundamentalist Mormons be presumed guilty of child abuse until proven innocent. But America is a free country, where suspects don't have to prove their innocence to anyone, including you. If that contradicts your feelings about justice being served -- too bad for your feelings.

I agree with Thomas.

I will add that the State's is quickly losing credibility. They have alleged several things that are patently untrue.

The allegation that all these kids are in one household is a ridiculous stretch (and this was one of the things the court points out)-- and the number of pregnant kids keeps shrinking.

The frustrating part is that this raid will be a costly, damaging failure that will accomplish very little. In fact... by eliminating any chance that social services can reach out to families in need within this community, it makes their lives much worse.

There are appropriate ways for government to act when there are accusations of child abuse. Sending in armed agents to snatch 400 kids may make a fearful public feel good... but the damage to these kids, their families and to civil rights is tragic.

That's an important point.

Just because the Child Protective Service has vastly overreached and then lied about it, that doesn't mean there is no sexual abuse happening among the fundamentalist Mormons. If and when it happens, you want the affected teenagers to trust the Child Protective Service enough to call it. But as things stand today, they can't. This means that in the long run, the CPS's actions have probably easier for sect elders to prey on teenage girls. Unlike before the raid, the predators can now expect that their victims are too scared of state authorities to seek help from them.

Yes there is an unjust and bigoted demand.

The CPS wants to take kids away from their parents... even when there is no real evidence that these kids are in danger of abuse... based solely on their involvement in a religious community.

The CPS needs to show that their actions (which undoubtably are damaging and traumatizing kids) are justified.

Demanding that parents need to fight just to keep their kids, when there is no evidence against them... is unjust and bigoted.

Commentary: Appellate court wrong on FLDS
(By Sunny Hostin, CNN, May 23, 2008)

It sounds like legal mumbo-jumbo.

The Texas Court of Appeals for the Third District found the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services failed to demonstrate there was either a danger to the physical health and safety of FLDS children, or an urgent need for protection of the children requiring immediate removal from their parents. The court also found the Department failed to make reasonable efforts to prevent the children's removal from their parents' custody.

What does all that mean without the legalese?

The court found no legal basis for FLDS kids to be taken from their mothers. They effectively think the district judge got it wrong.

And they told the district court judge she had 10 days to make it right or else. Well I think the appellate court got it wrong. Why?

Isn't this a polygamist ranch we are talking about? Under Texas law, it's illegal to be married to more than one person. Weren't all of these children living on a ranch purchased in 2003 and built by Warren Jeffs, the self-proclaimed prophet of the group, who was convicted last year in Utah of being an accomplice to rape?

Yes they were.

Weren't there 20 girls living at the ranch who had become pregnant between the ages of 13 and 17 and "spiritually married" to old men picked for them by Jeffs or his followers?

Yes there were.

And if you live on this ranch, don't you believe in polygamy, arranged marriages between young girls and old men, and that Jeffs is a prophet?

I would think so.

And if you are a young girl that lives on this ranch, isn't it true you will also be "spiritually married" to an old man chosen for you? Yes to that too. And isn't this dangerous for the children? What do you think?

There are some fundamental problems with the court's opinion. The court states that because not all FLDS families are polygamous or allow their female children to marry as minors, the entire ranch community does not subscribe to polygamy. Wrong.

They are living on a polygamist ranch and are members of the church -- a sect that left the Mormon Church so it could practice polygamy.

The court even reasoned that under Texas law, "it is not sexual assault to have consensual intercourse with a minor spouse to whom one is legally married" and that Texas law "allows minor to marry -- as young as age 16 with parental consent and younger than 16 if pursuant to court order." Wrong again.

The polygamists are not "legally married" to anyone since it is illegal to marry more than one person. They are "spiritually married" and abusing young girls. Finally, the court also states there "was no evidence that.... the female children who had not reached puberty, were victims of sexual or other physical abuse or in danger of being victims if sexual or other physical abuse."

Oh, I get it. The Department should wait until the kids are actually abused before doing anything. It's almost as if the Department can't win: If they act, they are overzealous; if they don't act, they are not doing the job entrusted to them -- protecting our children.

So how do we make this right? The Department now has the option of appealing the decision to the Texas Supreme Court.

Let's hope the Department takes that option and let's hope that court gets it right.

Columnists are paid to reflect and express public prejudice. It is the duty of judges to follow the law while ignoring public prejudice in favor of reason.

If columnists ever become judges... it won't just be polygamists who are in a whole load of trouble.

I don't see how any ethical judge can do anything other than follow the law-- meaning these kids, assuming there is no legal reason to keep them, will be sent home with their families.

Sunny Hostin is more than a "columnist". She graduated from Notre Dame Law School, served as an Assistant United States Attorney for Washington, D.C. and is now a legal commentator for CNN.

She points out that the appeals court incorrectly reasoned that "it is not sexual assault to have consensual intercourse with a minor spouse to whom one is legally married" and that Texas law "allows minor to marry -- as young as age 16 with parental consent and younger than 16 if pursuant to court order." Polygamy is illegal. Polygamists are therefore not legally married. Consequently, it would still be still be statutory rape.

That is a silly argument. She is making a frivolous argument over one (of thirteen) footnotes that is hardly core to the courts decision (not to mention it is unclear how many of them were in monogamous marriages).

The point is that the State of Texas is making wild ass assertions without evidence. These include the number of pregnant "girls" (several of whom turned out to be women and one was 27), the imminent danger to the children removed (i.e. none for boys or prepubescent girls), and the number of houses involved (which the state someone ridiculously alleges is exactly 1).

The State, in its' assertions, has clearly stretched the law to the point of breaking it.

I have never heard of Sunny before you mentioned her. After Googling her, I am not impressed... but nonetheless I think her article is ludicrous.

If Texas wanted to break up this cult on the grounds that polygamy is illegal then they should have come after them on those grounds, not on the charge of child abuse. In that instance we could have held a public discussion on polygamy, and whether it should still be illegal given the demands of multiculturalism that includes the Muslim religion. There is no way in hell Texas can justify the snatching of 460 people on the grounds that marrying more than on woman make all the marriages illegal thus some of the marriage unions statutory rape. Americans are in very high numbers poly sexual, and increasingly also practice poly love, the state can not go after poly marriage unions with out getting the back up of a sizable slice of the American citizenry.

No easy answers
(Fort Worth Star-Telegram Editorial, May 24, 2008)

No one disputes that removing more than 450 children from their parents in the Yearning For Zion ranch outside Eldorado had to be disruptive -- even traumatizing -- to those youngsters. The question is whether the children's interests were better served by placing them in foster care than by leaving them with a sect in which girls are made to marry and have children while still children themselves.

It's hard for child welfare officials to win. They're accused of over-reacting because they removed all the children from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints compound. Had they not acted, they might be accused of not protecting children from sexual abuse.

On Thursday, a three-judge appellate panel in Austin ruled that officials acted hastily, that they hadn't proved that a large number of younger children were in immediate danger and that a trial judge should have returned almost 130 children to their families after custody hearings in April.

But on Friday, the state appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, saying the appellate panel wrongly second-guessed the trial judge and would force the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to return children to an atmosphere of "continuing sexual and emotional abuse."

Ruling on a petition filed by about three dozen mothers, the court said that state District Judge Barbara Walther erred in not overruling the decision to remove the children from their families on an emergency basis. The court's reasoning: Though the state identified 20 women at the ranch who became pregnant while they were between 13 and 17 years old, all but five now are adults, none lived with the women petitioning the court, and there wasn't evidence younger children had been physically or sexually abused.

The appeals court rejected the state's arguments that the ranch community was one "household" and that all the children were in danger because of the "pervasive belief system" that young girls should marry and have children. The court also said that the state hadn't tried ways of protecting the children that would keep families intact.

The sect's belief system by itself doesn't put the children in physical danger, said Chief Justice Kenneth Law and Justices Bob Pemberton and Alan Waldrop.

"Even if one views the FLDS belief system as creating a danger of sexual abuse by grooming boys to be perpetrators of sexual abuse and raising girls to be victims of sexual abuse as the department contends, there is no evidence that this danger is 'immediate' or 'urgent'... with respect to every child in the community."

But in its Friday petition, the agency argued that Walther had done "what was prudent and cautious based on the evidence available" at the hearing and that the appeals court engaged in "a poor analysis of misstated facts."

Though the ruling would require that children be returned to their parents, agency lawyers argued that it's still not clear which children belong to which parents.

The authenticity of the abuse report that triggered the state's raid now is in question, but it's clear the community encouraged, even forced, underaged girls to have children.

The case has raised difficult legal, moral and social questions. And no doubt it's agonizing for families to be split while the legal process runs its course.

Children and their parents should be reunited as soon as possible -- but not until state officials and the courts are assured that children now in foster care aren't being returned to a situation that clearly risks their welfare.

Bull!

It is very simple. Child Protective Services f***ed up in a big way. They want you to feel sorry for them, but they handled this in the worst way possible.

The first mistake is bigotry-- pure and simple. They had decided in their minds that this community was not made of human beings... but of inhuman zombie monsters, and they acted accordingly.

They didn't try to talk to the community. They didn't even try to talk to local officials. They didn't take the time to find out if the phone call was real or not.

Their decision was an armed raid to take every single child and young adult-- not just those in physical danger, but those in danger of "religious beliefs". It was extreme, draconian and ridiculous.

There are law enforcement officials dealing with similar communities in other states-- I heard a discussion with law enforcement officials in Utah on NPR-- who handle concerns of child abuse in responsible ways.

Responsibility would mean....

1. Accepting that these people are human beings with civil rights under the law.

2. Being careful to make sure you know the whole story based on facts (rather than bigotry) before you take a drastic action.

3. Trying to work with the community... being strict on the law, but giving the community the opportunity to follow it, before taking the most drastic action.

4. Following the law yourself.

The Child Protective Services chose an irresponsible extreme course of action. And, the unnecessary disaster that is happening now is the result.

But that's not what the law said in this case. The law, as spoken by the court, said the police claimed to have good evidence when in fact they didn't. What do you want to see happen when the police doesn't have good evidence, and greatly oversells whatever bad evidence it has?

It is true that not all of the allegations have been conclusively resolved yet. Another question that hasn't been conclusively resolved yet is whether you are a child molester. Or I. Or Edgar. Or e_brown. There are countless questions of criminal law that haven't been resolved yet. And the way the rule of law works, the presumptive answer to all these questions is that the accused are innocent until proven guilty.

Contrast this with what Edgar said: "Until it is shown conclusively that the allegations of child abuse are wrong, I will not feel any justice has been served here." My reading of this sentence is that he presumes the fundamentalist Mormons guilty of child abuse until they prove themselves innocent of it. I believe this reading is correct: Edgar has since disagreed with parts of my post, but my reading of his original statement was not among them.

Presuming people guilty until proven innocent negates one of the most fundamental principles in the rule of law, not to mention 2000 years of good jurisprudence built on it. So my answer to your question, WandelJW, is yes. Yes, Edgar has made a bigoted and unjust demand.

</quote>

I'm not sure what you're saying when you claim there is NO dispute over the dispute.

For instance, I live in the same community as my neighbors. If my neighbor's teenage daughter, legally married or otherwise, becomes pregnant, does the State then have the legal authority to step in and take emergency custody of my infant child? of every single child in my community? Wouldn't we all be appalled if State authorities suddenly appeared, rounded up all of the children in our community, herded them into buses, and shipped them to distant housing facilities all over the State?

THAT is the issue (dispute) in the Texas case, and the Texas Court of Appeals ruled that the State does NOT have the legal authority to take emergency custody of ALL the children in the entire community based on a generalized fear that some children in the community might be in physical danger someday in the distant future.

In the United States of America, all residents (even Texas residents) have a constitutionally-secured right to DUE PROCESS pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Accordingly, if the State has grounds to believe that a parent is abusing his/her child, and the individual child at issue is NOT in imminent physical danger, then the parent is procedurally entitled to NOTICE of the grounds/evidence that the State is relying on to substantiate the allegation of abuse and an OPPORTUNITY to be heard in a court of law and to REQUIRE the State to PROVE its allegation by clear and convincing evidence BEFORE the State has any legal authority to take any action whatsoever. Additionally, even when the STATE proves an allegation of abuse by clear and convincing evidence, removal of a child from parental custody is the LAST resort--not the FIRST resort.

By removing ALL the children from the entire community en masse before any allegation concerning any particular child was litigated on an individualized basis, the parents of those children were deprived of DUE PROCESS.

Let's say an 18-year-old mother of a newborn infant claims that her sexual relations with the infant's father was consensual, that she is happy with her lifestyle and living in a religious community that hold views that the rest of us may not like, and she proclaims that having and mothering child is a blessing of the highest calling. Just because the State alleges that the young mother might raise her child to hold the same views,
does that constitute grounds to remove her newborn infant from her care, custody, and control and to place that child into the State's foster care system?

I don't belong to her church, but I also believe that having a child was one of the most wonderful things that I ever did with my life--but I'm not being "persecuted" or threatened by the State because of my belief.

Where do we draw the line? I find the views of racists (e.g., white supremists) and homophobes to be morally repugnant. I believe their children are in "danger" of being raised to hold those same morally repugnant views. Should the State step in and remove their children from their homes too in order to remove the danger that those children will become the racists and homophobes of the future?

Because there has to be a line drawn, the 18 year old mother should be able to make her own decisions. (I have not written here out of a desire to punish polygamy. I couldn't care less what consenting adults do). But, underage girls are a different matter to me. I would like to be certain they are not being abused.

I understand. Any person who is guilty of rape ought to be prosecuted. Any parent who allows their child to be raped ought to be prosecuted.

But, does the State have legal authority to take these people's children away from them NOW because of a generalized fear that these people might raise their children to be FUTURE perpetrators and victims of crime? Mere conjecture is not proof by clear and convincing evidence. Based on mere conjecture concerning the possibility of future harm, the State is attempting to use its vast power to deprive parents of their children and to deprive children of their parents.

"The Department's lead investigator was of the opinion that due to the 'pervasive belief system' of the FLDS, the male children are groomed to be perpetrators of sexual abuse and the girls are raised to be victims of sexual abuse." Thus, the State is alleging that it has the authority to remove ALL of these children from their parents' care, custody, and control, in order to protect them from possible harm that might happen sometime in the future due to their parents' "pervasive belief system." However, the State failed to establish that all of these people shared the alleged "pervasive belief system." The Court of Appeals noted, "The Department's witnesses conceded that there are differences of opinion among the FLDS community as to what is an appropriate age to marry, how many spouses to have, and when to start having children--much as there are differences of opinion regarding the details of religious doctrine among other religious groups."

This is a WITCH HUNT, pure and simple, and these people are being persecuted.

I was talking about the young woman's newborn baby, as an example. Does the State have the legal authority to take her infant into emergency State custody based on a generalized fear of what the future may hold for this infant if raised in a FLDS community that embraces a polygamous lifestyle?

Based on accounts discussed on the Larry King Live Show, the State took a 23-year-old pregnant mother and her two children, aged 2 and 3, into State custody. They held the 23-year-old pregnant mother as a "minor" until she gave birth, and then they took her baby from her. After the State got her newborn baby, then the State acknowledged that she was not a minor and released HER from custody, but not her kids. Why was it necessary for the State to take her children away from her?

Some states use the clear and convincing evidence standard and some states use the preponderance of the evidence standard with respect to child dependency proceedings; some states mix and match standards depending on the circumstances, i.e., whether the state is seeking to place a child in a residential treatment facility where the child's liberty will be greatly diminished. ALL states must use the clear and convincing standard as a matter of constitutional law with respect to parental rights termination proceedings. Santosky v. Kramer, 455

This is a violation of civil rights for parents and their children. More then that, it is putting these kids through needless trauma.

Thomas,

I believe there is an important distinction between protective custody and actual severance of the parent/child relationship. Obviously, severance would be final. The ongoing hearings have already returned children to their parents. Individual hearings are necessary, that is why it is taking a long time. To me, protective custody is an early step. Severance is a final step.

ebrown,

I have four children. I do not think that religion is the only factor in the FLDS situation.

well, in the US there is a major difference between termination of parental rights and protective custody with essentially 2 different legal processes involved. federal Permanency Planning law requires every child placed out of the home under child protection rules be under the jurisdiction of the courts and there must be a plan for either returning the child to the biological parent (s) or finding a permanent family/home for the child within 6 months. While, of course, it is VERY tramatic for both the children and the parents the primary function of child protection is to ensure the safety and welfare of children which is often arbitrary and capricious activity with no clear cut legal proceedings but most often "judgement" calls by the courts and the state.

Religious experts: Texas polygamist sect skilled at misleading authorities

11:40 PM CDT on Saturday, May 24, 2008
By EMILY RAMSHAW and ROBERT T. GARRETT / The Dallas Morning News
<a href="mailto:eramshaw@dallasnews.com">eramshaw@dallasnews.com</a> ; <a href="mailto:rtgarrett@dallasnews.com">rtgarrett@dallasnews.com</a>

AUSTIN - Child welfare officials were up against a culture of secrecy, unlimited resources and sect members well-schooled in the art of misleading authorities as they tried to build their case for removing hundreds of children from a West Texas polygamist enclave, religious experts and former adherents say.

Thursday's appeals court decision that many if not all of the children removed from the Yearning For Zion ranch last month must be returned to their parents highlights how difficult it is to build a child welfare case against a fundamentalist religious group, sect investigators say - particularly without a vocal victim.

The 450 children remain in state custody while the Texas Supreme Court decides whether to take up the case. But the legal challenge has kindled quiet debate over whether Texas authorities should deal with polygamist groups as states such as Utah and Arizona have done: trying to win cooperation rather than raiding communities and prosecuting members en masse.

"These are people who have been taught from the cradle that outsiders are bad, that government is evil, until they fear us more than they fear their abusers," said Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff.

Added Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard: "Step by step, we've tried to make sure that people... understood what the rules were, understood what we were going to prosecute and that we weren't going to condemn them just for their lifestyle."

'No reliable evidence'

Leaders of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints vehemently deny misleading state officials. Lying is not part of their culture, they say - privacy is.

"The record's clearly going to show what the deceptions were and who lied to whom," said sect leader Willie Jessop, referring to state investigators.

CPS officials, citing the ongoing legal battle, declined to discuss specifics of the case. But in a filing to the Texas Supreme Court on Friday, lawyers for Texas' Department of Family and Protective Services said collecting evidence was extraordinarily difficult. Girls routinely switched their names and identified themselves as mothers of other women's children. Some didn't even come forward to claim their own kin.

"Based on both the children's and women's repeated deceptions, lies, and misinformation, the trial court had no reliable evidence" on the identities of the children or their parents, the state's attorneys wrote. The appellate court's ruling last week centered on a general lack of evidence.

For her, lying was duty

This comes as no surprise to Mary Mackert, a former FLDS member who, as a child in a polygamous family, was taught that her behavior could determine whether her father ended up in jail. She is in Texas because of her interest in the children.

Her mother rehearsed lies with her children: When her father spent the night at his other wives' houses? "Daddy's a traveling salesman." Why didn't the family attend the mainstream Mormon church? "Daddy's a Catholic."

By the time Ms. Mackert, from Utah, was married herself - at 17, to a 50-year-old - lying was second nature. When her husband was in public with her, he would ask their children to "come to Grandpa." When Ms. Mackert took the rent check to the landlord, she referred to her husband as her father.

"You didn't think of it as lying. It's your duty and your responsibility to protect those who are living the principle," Ms. Mackert said. "They're going to lie to protect their prophet, and the head of their family. They'll do anything under the banner of religion."

That includes draining their resources, said Sam Brower, a Utah-based polygamist investigator and expert on the FLDS sect.

Mr. Brower said that the sect's legal strategy is simply to outlast opponents - and that it has the money to do it, thanks to various successful businesses the church owns. He said the sect has brought in virtually every high-powered attorney it's ever used to tackle the West Texas case.

Religious leaders also make investigators' work harder by shuttling people across state lines, Mr. Brower said. Often, he said, people of interest simply "disappear" - making something as simple as serving a subpoena incredibly costly. When investigators get too close, Mr. Brower said, sect leaders order entire families to turn in their photo albums, birth certificates and other records to be hidden or destroyed.

"It's like dealing with the mob, only worse," Mr. Brower said. "Part of their culture is to create confusion."

The wrong approach?

Mr. Jessop called such statements "outrageous and barbaric." He said investigators have never cared to hear sect members' side of the story - relying on rumors and former adherents with agendas to guide them.

"There has been such a blatant disregard for the truth," he said. "Everything's about sensation. There have been no boundaries."

For many sect members, the Yearning For Zion case brings up painful memories of the 1953 raids on Short Creek - a now-renamed town on the Utah-Arizona border where more than 300 FLDS women and children were sent into foster care.

They hope the West Texas case will play out like Short Creek did: After a public backlash that brought down an Arizona governor, families were eventually reunited.

If it does, experts say, Texas officials can learn from Utah and Arizona, where officials have emphasized selective prosecution for child and domestic abuse, not targeting polygamy itself or going after entire communities.

The two states created a safety committee made up of sect members, social workers and law enforcement officials, with monthly meetings that rotate among cities with significant polygamist populations.

Mr. Goddard, the Arizona attorney general, said authorities in both states have worked closely since 2003, creating a hotline for abused youths to call and preventing FLDS leader Warren Jeffs from using the sect's trust fund and local police and government jobs "to coerce" followers to toe the line.

"In the past, we were afraid to seek help and to go to the police because we were afraid that they would charge us," said Heidi Foster, a Salt Lake City mother of 12 who has been in a polygamous marriage and now helps run a support group for fundamentalist Mormon women.

Texas' approach drives sect women "further underground," she said. "They're going to be more likely to try and handle it themselves and not seek help."

Imminent danger cited

Texas officials have portrayed their case as simply too urgent. The sect's pervasive belief in marrying off underage girls put every child there in imminent danger, they argued. A trial judge agreed, but the appellate court did not.

Mr. Jessop said if sect members are ever allowed to return to the ranch, it would be a long time until they trust the government.

While some kind of "cooperative" community policing model might work, he doesn't foresee sect members changing their lifestyle.

"The belief of the people is that religion is not the problem, bias against religion is the problem," Mr. Jessop said. "It's a little bit like asking a Christian to give up Christianity to get their children back."

</quote>
not quite all that black and white depending on various state laws but there are "inbetween" situations as well as "simple" terminations" as as open adoptions where the biologic parent(s) remain involved to some degree but legal and phyiscal custody is held by adoptive parents as well as 'guardianships' where legal termination may not necessarily occur but the 'guardian' parents have almost total legal and physical custody/decision making authority (generally speaking protective services does not remain actively involved in such cases other than periodic review for the courts) I cannot answer specific questions re Texas law but can answer general questions about protective services.

I'd be interested in your take on the reasonableness of the removal, Dys.

The laws and investigative methods appear to be so different from the ones I am used to that I cannot really make sense of them, or of how reasonably they were used......though the court has now spoken...however, we are both presumably aware of how badly courts protect kids...(at least here.....for all I know they are over zealous in Texas????)

We also know how poorly the state anywhere has protected kids in families, never mind in cults.

Part of the problem is the common use of the word "cult".

This word has no meaning other than "new religion that I don't like".

I have seen the silly attempts to give criteria of cult... but none of them have any use to say anything useful about the wildly disparate groups to which this disparaging term has been applied. These groups have ranged from suicide pacts to business methods to presidential candidates.

Vague disparaging terms like "cult" aren't helpful for a reasonable discusion.

I think cult DOES have some quite reasonable meaning, and can generally be distinguished from just a "new religion that I don't like", though I understand your point. The concerning factor for me is always the degree of isolation imposed by the beliefs.......because isolation is a strong risk factor re child abuse (and other forms of abuse.)

Of course, isolation of this type does not necessarily involve abuse, but it is a risk factor.

I don't think the pure civil liberties view you and some others are espousing takes into account the child protection concerns, and I think you are minimising them in your defence of the groups' civil liberties.

I also think some of the people here most agitated around the child abuse possibilities have not taken into account the possible breach of civil liberties.

I personally have no problem with polygamy or any gamy or androusness undertaken by fully informed consenting adults. But, we have some reason to believe underage kids have been abused here. We also know how difficult it is to find out what is happening to kids in secretive and isolated sects (if that word makes you happy).

I don't much like any religion, and don't base my hierarchy of dislike on age of said religion.

The court has spoken, so the law apparently says that the taking of the kids was unwarranted, and it may well have been, however, that doesn't mean these people are innocent, nor that they were targeted purely because they are different.

the state claims that bringing up children in a culture that promotes early marriage and childbearing is abuse, it is coercion which according to the state is force. My point is that early marriage and childbearing is not against the law, if Texas has a problem with these two practices then Texas needs to see about outlawing them. If these individuals do not break the law then the state needs to leave them alone. Teaching kids that they should marry and have kids as soon as the law allows is not child abuse, it is not a crime, it is not immoral, it is practicing freedom of choice. Even the cult agrees that if the state can prove that individuals and individual families did not follow the law then the state has a right to punish the offenders, the problem for the state is that they can find very few if any individuals to punish. The state keeps going back to harping on the culture, which these do-gooders what to change. The state has no right to force the culture to change. The CPS officials need to live their own life, let others live theirs, and if they have a standard that they want everyone to adopt then they are free to partake in the democratic process. They are not free to use their positions of public service to punish law abiding citizens who happen not to agree with them what is the best way to live or the best way to raise a family.

FLDS sect case hits CPS staff in wallet
By JOHN MORITZStar-Telegram staff writer

AUSTIN -- The strain of handling the huge child custody case involving a polygamous sect in West Texas is trickling down through the ranks of Child Protective Services caseworkers who are pinching pennies while waiting for the state to repay them for overdue travel expenses.

Officials from the Texas Department of Family Protective Services say the agency is struggling to reduce a growing backlog in reimbursement requests for out-of-pocket expenses from caseworkers in the field who say the skyrocketing price of gasoline is hampering their ability to do their jobs.

Darrell Azar, a spokesman for the agency that oversees Child Protective Services and Adult Protective Services, blamed the backlog in part on the ongoing operations at the West Texas polygamist ranch where more than 460 children have been taken into state custody. But he also said the agency will soon hire an additional auditor and as many as eight temporary employees to process the avalanche of expense reports being filed not only from the West Texas operations but also from caseworkers statewide.

"We are behind, there's no doubt," Azar said last week. "But plans are in place to speed up reimbursements."

Azar said the agency has heard "anecdotal complaints" from CPS workers that they are having to dig deeper into their own pockets as they drive hundreds of miles a week checking up on youngsters in foster care or on parents at risk of losing custody of their children. The agency normally processes reimbursement within two to three weeks after they are submitted, but the backlog has extended the time by a couple of weeks, he said.

'I'm out of gas'

But a longtime CPS worker in the Dallas-Fort Worth region said any delay inflicts almost immediate pain on employees.

"We're being told that we might have to wait another 30 days for our expense checks. With the price of gas at about $4 a gallon, we're hurting," said the worker, who asked that her name not be used out of concern that it might jeopardize her job. "I typically drive about 300 miles a week. My credit card is maxed out, and I'm out of gas."

Mike Gross, vice president of the Texas State Employees Union, said his office has fielded complaints about slow reimbursements and the state's policy of calculating mileage based on the shortest possible route to and from each destination workers must visit. The effect of the policy, he said, is that workers often use bypasses and beltways to avoid congestion and save time, even if the routes are a few miles longer.

"They're having to eat those extra miles," Gross said.

Azar said his department can do little about the policy, which has been in place for several years and applies to all state agencies. CPS workers are reimbursed at 50.5 cents per mile, the maximum under federal standards, he added.

Mounting costs

Operations resulting from the April 3 raid on the compound near Eldorado operated by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints are threatening to blow a hole in the state budget. Preliminary costs for employee overtime, travel and lodging for the first few weeks show expenditures topping $5.5 million. That figure is expected to rise dramatically as more invoices are submitted from the field.

The cost of providing foster care for the children in custody plus support services is expected to run at least $1.7 million per month for as long as the youngsters remain wards of the state. The cost of legal representation for the children has not been fully calculated but is expected to go well into the millions.

The CPS worker in North Texas, who is not part of the Eldorado operations, said she and many of her co-workers fear that as attention is focused on the children from the compound, the day-to-day needs of the rest of the work force might be overlooked.

The slow pace of reimbursements, she said, affects not only her professional life, but also her personal life.

"I'm having to make choices between buying gas for the car so I can make my visits or buying medicines for" her medical condition, she said. "I'm fixing to go to [a charity] to get my meds. It's that bad."

Azar said the agency is sympathetic to such reports and is working to minimize any hardships.

"I think most of this goes back to the price of gas, which affects just about everybody, including state employees," he said. "I think that what's happening is that, as gas prices go up, our employees file their expense reports faster and faster. And that results in the backlogs. Add in the huge amount of invoices coming in from Eldorado, and the backlogs just get bigger. That's why we're adding staff and trying to speed things up."

The court has spoken, so the law apparently says that the taking of the kids was unwarranted, and it may well have been, however, that doesn't mean these people are innocent, nor that they were targeted purely because they are different.

Yes. But that's a trivial fact that applies to everyone. Just because you or I have never been found guilty of child abuse, that doesn't mean we didn't abuse children either. But I agree with the general point. Power abuse by the government of Texas and child abuse by some of the parents accused of it are not mutually exclusive.

Exactly!

If governmental concern about possible future harm is sufficient to justify the removal of children from their parents, it is difficult to know where the line can be drawn.

Good point, however unlike being in a gang, being a drug dealer, or being a drug user getting married at 16 (used to be 14) and having babies is not illegal. There are millions of kids who are predictably headed for illegal behaviour that should have been removed from their families before these cult kids were, based upon the theory that you help those most in need first...and that first requires one to come to the conclusion that teaching kids to marry early and have babies early is a bad thing. It was only two generations ago that perhaps even the majority of young girls thought that finding a man and having babies as soon as possible was a life goal, this concept is not either novel or with out sound logical arguments to back it, and those who practiced this belief system seemed to live happy and fruitful lives. What has changed over these few short years to make what was normal such an abomination?? And why do the moral crusaders at Texas CPS get to decide for every other Texas citizen what lawful beliefs make one ineligible to raise children?

I personally have no problem with polygamy or any gamy or androusness undertaken by fully informed consenting adults.

that has been my opinion all along

But, we have some reason to believe underage kids have been abused here. We also know how difficult it is to find out what is happening to kids in secretive and isolated sects (if that word makes you happy).

a woman who had escaped the cult some time ago pointed out that the children never have a free choice about how they want to live. they are told from an early age on that they MUST only listen to their leaders and not anyone else.
i know that there is no law against those teachings and probably NEVER will be.
perhaps letting in some "fresh air" will allow some of the young people see a different part of life - which is a good thing imo - even though some may claim that it collides with the civil liberties of the ADULT LEADERS.

An enormous amount of pain has been inflicted on these kids, and they know it is at the hand of the state. What this event teaches the kids is that the adults are right, the state and all outsiders can not be trusted. Texas has turned back the clock on all of the efforts in Arizona and other states to get the polygamists to open up to outsiders enough that abuse can be found out and also to influence how kids are taught. The stupidity of one Texas CPS employee and one judge has rubbed out the hard work of many people over the last 20 years to improve the situation.

This is not an argument about civil rights vs. the need to protect kids. The same argument is being used to justify taking our rights to protect us from terrorists. It is simply a false choice.

The state chose an armed raid and the forced removal of hundreds of kids. I have yet to hear a logical explanation of why this particular decision is anything but an obvious blundering overreaction to public prejudice.

Let's say a competent well meaning child protection authority was concerned about the welfare of kids in a religious community. There are several ways to address these concerns that didn't involve an armed raid and exaggerated claims to mislead the public. They should have started by at least checking the initial story. Then they could have spoken with the community... or local law enforcement.

With a little bit of discretion, they may have been able to reduce or avoid the trauma to kids.

Whatever you think of the FLDS members the actions of the CPS have been reprehensible and incompetent.

They bent the law to the point of breaking it. They misled the public about the initial call and the number of pregnant kids in custody. And... they took the most drastic, harmful action first without considering other alternative or the consequences.

as an aside, the feminist drive to reorder masculine/feminine interaction goes far to explain the disastrous raid of the FDLS cult and the snatching of their children. Women are not free to consent to live a life of gender values as historically practiced, it is highly offensive to the women who are in the process of trying to reform society into new gender behaviour patterns (and the idiot men who conspire with them). The emotional recoiling of women at watching other women choose to ignore the cause, to choose to practice the old ways, makes normally sensible law abiding women do extremely stupid things. It is no accident that in state that allows its child protective workers huge latitude in deciding to take the kids that the one CPS employee who directed the disaster, and the one judge who allowed the CPS to follow through on her desire, where both women. If a man had been involved, or if the action would have required consensus of a group of experts which included men, this emotionally driven but unlawful assault on individuals would have almost certainly have been prevented. The FDLS raid is an illustration of what can happen when women are in charge, and it also illustrates the ignorance of many modern women, those who insist that human nature needs to be changed because they don't like how humans behave. Ya, that will happen. How many people will their fundamentalist zeal destroy before they wise up I wonder??

Kids are resilient, however in this type of situation being a kid is a handicap in overcoming the trauma. Kids will not understand why they have been taken from their home, why they don't see their parents much if at all, why they don't get to see their friends and sometimes their sibs. Plus to many of these kids the several months it will take to correct this error made by the CPS is a very long time. For an adult a few months is a blip of time, have you any concept of what three months is to a three year old???

Senate panel suggests taking FLDS sect's assets to cover costs
By JOHN MORITZStar-Telegram Staff Writer

AUSTIN -- With the price tag of providing care for more than 400 children seized last month from a polygamist ranch in West Texas expected to reach the tens of millions of dollars, a legislative panel suggested Tuesday that the state explore garnisheeing the religious organization's assets to recoup the costs.

"That compound didn't grow out of fairy dust," Sen. Robert Deuell, R-Greenville, said after a Senate Finance Committee hearing in which he urged state health officials to determine whether members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or even the sect as a whole, should be held responsible for the cost of care. "Why should we be footing the bill when they've got assets?"

The remarks came after the panel heard testimony that providing foster care, Medicaid coverage and casework for the children from the YFZ (Yearning For Zion) Ranch will likely cost taxpayers more than $1.7 million a month for as long as they are in state custody. The figure does not include the $5.3 million for the first six weeks of the operation or the cost of providing the required legal representation for each of the children, which is likely to cost at least $2.2 million.

The committee, which plays a lead role in drafting and overseeing the state budget, is exploring ways to cover the near-term costs even though no money was appropriated last year for such an event.

Legislative leaders and Gov. Rick Perry's office expect an emergency appropriation will be necessary when lawmakers return to Austin in January to ensure that the state's bills for the operation are paid.

"We basically need to pay what it's going to cost to do the job right, and we need to know, to the best of your ability, what that cost is so we can factor that in when we're making decisions about other worthwhile costs and needs in this state," Sen. Steve Ogden, a Bryan Republican who heads the finance panel, told Albert Hawkins, the state's executive commissioner for health and human services.

Law enforcement officers and officials from Child Protective Services rounded up the children from the ranch near Eldorado after an anonymous caller claimed to be a pregnant and abused 16-year-old forced into a marriage with a 50-year-old.

Officials now believe that the call may have been a hoax.

But CPS workers have said that the children were in imminent danger of abuse. In court hearings that began Monday in San Angelo, many parents are seeking to regain custody.

Deuell said efforts should be made to determine whether any of the children placed in foster care are covered by the parents' private insurance. If so, he said, the state would not have to enroll them in the taxpayer-supported Medicaid program.

Hawkins said it is unclear whether sect members have private insurance. He also said that officials have found no evidence that anyone from the sect is receiving public assistance.

Even if the adults do have private insurance, the children would still likely require Medicaid coverage, Hawkins said, because DNA testing to determine parentage is expected to take up to two months to complete.

Rod Parker, a spokesman for the FLDS, said any effort to seize assets would be an overreach by the state.

"I think my response is to ask the state on what legal grounds it believes it would be entitled to take FLDS assets," Parker said in an e-mail to the Star-Telegram. "This is a country of laws; they cannot simply go after assets without legal basis."

Texas Lawmakers Adding Up Costs Of Polygamy Case
AUSTIN (AP) ― State lawmakers started adding up Tuesday the "extraordinary" costs related to the raid on a polygamist sect's ranch last month and began trying to figure out where to find the expected $30 million the case will eventually cost over the next year.

"We basically need to pay what it's going to cost to do the job right and we need to know, to the best of your ability, what that cost is so we can factor that in when we're making decisions about other worthwhile costs and needs in this state," Senate Finance Committee Chairman Steve Ogden told Health and Human Services Executive Commissioner Albert Hawkins during a hearing Thursday.

Hawkins said it would cost about $1.7 million a month for the state to care for more than 460 children who were removed from the ranch last month and are now scattered in foster-care facilities around the state. Authorities believe members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, who run the ranch, pushed underage girls into marriage and sex.

One lawmaker questioned whether the state could make the adults left behind on the 1,700-acre ranch -- valued at $20.5 million -- foot the state's bill.

"I would encourage you to aggressively pursue any of those assets to fund this," said Republican Sen. Bob Deuell of Greenville. State health and human services officials said they were still trying to figure out which ranch residents are the children's biological parents.

The initial raid cost an estimated $5.3 million, mostly in travel to the isolated Schleicher County ranch and employee overtime during the weeklong raid and search of the Yearning For Zion ranch last month. The state also paid for buses, building and equipment rental and fuel.

At least $2.2 million will be needed to help the local courts handle legal proceedings for each child.

Ben Woodward, a state district judge in Tom Green County, said the local courts in his county and Schleicher County, where the ranch is located, are ill-equipped to handle the unprecedented undertaking.

"It is a pretty desperate situation and a red flag for the judiciary," Woodward said. "We are funded on this case pretty much by the counties and they simply don't have it."

Woodward said the legal costs would exceed $2.2 million. Schleicher County's total budget was $3.9 million, he said.

Because the state did not anticipate the raid when they wrote the current budget last year, it will be tricky to find the money and make it available before the Legislature's next scheduled session in January.

There are mechanisms within the state's $168 billion budget to address unexpected costs.

Money set aside for County Essential Services Grants can be used at the discretion of Gov. Rick Perry. Perry has said the state would do whatever was necessary to cover the costs of the raid and its aftermath.

State emergency funds also could be used, but only if Perry declares the situation an emergency. Perry's office did not immediately return a call seeking comment on whether the situation constitutes a state emergency.

"I'm reasonably convinced that there's enough money in the state to do this if we want to," Ogden said.

The political cost of needing to come up with emergency funds to pay the bills of an illegal act is the phase of this mess that i can't wait to get to. I want to see the political blood flowing, starting from the Governors office. Then I want to see the top five officials at CPS fired.

i don't know if any of you have seen the interviews with some of the women who had left the sect some time ago.
i think they gave a pretty good desciption of what life on the "ranch" was like.

(several women who had left one of the mormon sects in british-columbia - canada during the last few years have given interviews to canada's CBC and several newspapers at various times - and they all tell pretty much the same :
"listen to your leaders and don't listen to any outsiders".)

here is just one of the women speaking up who had left the texas ranch some time ago - she'll tell her own story :

<quote>
Woman who left Mormon sect describes years of 'mind control'

David Perlmutt

The Charlotte Observer

April 30, 2008

CHARLOTTE, N.C.

She was raised by her father and his three wives, surrounded by 12 siblings.

There was no TV, no radio. At school, she was taught that man never landed on the moon. She and other girls in the polygamist Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints were required to "keep sweet," free of jealousy or anger, or risk beatings or humiliation.

And by the time Kathy Jo Nicholson turned 14, she was sewing her wedding dress, knowing that any day she could be thrown into marriage with a man three times her age.

Nicholson never finished that dress. Instead, she began to question her faith and, at 18, walked out on it.

All those memories flooded back after authorities removed more than 500 women and children -- she knows many -- from a Texas compound run by the men who once controlled her life.

"I am happy for the children, though I know they're terrified," said Nicholson, 37, who has lived in Charlotte with her husband and two sons since 2004. "But, now, they have a chance.

"Their mothers, too, have a chance if they'll just grab on to the hands that are reaching out. I know they're conflicted. I know the mind control."

Practicing 'the principle'

She was 3 when her father, John Nicholson, moved his four daughters, a son and two wives from California to Utah to live among other polygamists. They joined the FLDS, a breakaway sect of Mormons that practices "the principle" -- the idea that men must have three wives to reach heaven.

At the church, the leader, or prophet, placed young girls with husbands in nonbinding but sacred "spiritual marriages." If a wife served her husband faithfully, he would take her to heaven.

The Nicholsons didn't live in a compound like the followers in Texas, but in a middle-class neighborhood outside Salt Lake City. They were near the church run first by Leroy Johnson -- Uncle Roy -- then Rulon Jeffs and later his son, Warren.

Their neighbors were traditional Mormons, who had rejected polygamy long ago.

"I was always aware of being different, and I really hated it," Nicholson said. "When we were little, we had friends in the neighborhood. As we got older, they rejected us. They threw bricks through the window. They egged us. They called us names, four-letter words and 'polygs.' "

'Metallic music is the devil'

John Nicholson worked for church-run companies. Sundays were spent at the temple, where Uncle Roy told followers he would live forever. Kathy Jo believed him. He died when she was 15. She began to see her faith as "a big lie."

She grew rebellious at the church-run Alta Academy, where Warren Jeffs was headmaster. He forbade students from watching TV. "Hard-metallic music," he would preach, "is the devil."

Jeffs made girls wear "prairie dresses" of the same fabric -- "we looked like we were on a wagon train." If students disobeyed, they were beaten, physically or emotionally.

"We had to pray Warren's way," Nicholson said. "We got to sing songs that Warren approved. He just systematically ripped us of every individual thought, or action or unique trait you could possibly have."

Caught passing a note to a boy, Kathy Jo was expelled and sent to work at a church-run factory. There, she fell in love with a man named Matt. He was seven years her senior, worldly, but also questioning the church.

By then, she had met Brian. At first, she hid her past. But as they grew closer, bits of it came out. She was surprised that he didn't seem to mind.

The newlyweds lived in California, Maine, then suburban Charlotte. Along the way, Nicholson got years of counseling. She has also tried to keep up with family and her former church.

Rulon Jeffs died in 2002, and Warren Jeffs became its leader.

A year later, her mother and a brother left the church and came to live with her.

Now she watches the Texas scene unfold and grieves for her family. She and her mother have lost touch with relatives. She learned from a reporter that her father died in January. She doesn't know how many nieces and nephews she has but thinks some are in Texas.

"I've been e-mailing social workers, but I don't know what they look like," she said.

"I know the women feel everything is crumbling. But this could be a new beginning -- if they'll just let it."

You seem to be unable (or unwilling) to accept the idea that there may be more than one side of the story.

Do you accept without question the interviews with "ex-homosexuals" explaining from experience how bad the "homosexual lifestyle" is? (I have heard similar stories from ex-catholics-- and even similar testimonies from recent converts to Christianity about their ex-sinful life.)

A little skepticism is a good thing... especially for those of you who want to see things in such unquestioning, right-and-wrong terms.

Wow, she got up and left??? Who knew that FLDS women could do that.

How many people leave a religion and look back on their time in it with less than fond memories? How many of these memories years after the fact are firmly rooted in the experience as it was lived and not all of the emotional baggage that came after? Anyone talked to a lapsed Catholic lately??

In any case all of this emotional stuff is not relevant. This is a nation of laws, that is how we operate this society. Laws can't always change people so the law is not the cure-all for all of our social ills, but for damn sure the state can only do what the laws say it can do. Half the problem here is that we had a idiot judge who ruled by her emotions and not the law, let's not make the same mistake at a2k.

Rebecca Walsh: Feminists waffle in FLDS case
By Rebecca Walsh
Tribune Columnist
Article Last Updated: 05/25/2008 02:29:12 AM MDT

Click photo to enlargeRebecca Walsh«1»Don't wait for Gloria Allred to step into the mess in Texas.
She's watching Larry King, the news conferences. Over the years, she has been asked to represent some of the FLDS women. But she's waiting for the right case.
So far, this one doesn't seem to be it.
For a feminist attorney who has made a career out of representing some of the most maligned, powerless women in America - Rob Lowe's nanny, Scott Peterson's mistress, Orem water scofflaw Betty Perry - polygamous wives are not easy victims.
"We're so used to thinking of the individual rights of each woman. Here, it's all turned on its head. In polygamy, all women must be subordinated," Allred says. "Women are obviously treated like property. They're prizes for men who obey the rules."
On its face, polygamy treats women as a commodity - good only for breeding and child-rearing. No matter how progressive some polygamists claim to be, the notion that one man should have several women is inherently sexist.
And Warren Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints interpretation of polygamy is particularly controlling - women are uneducated, financially dependent and impregnated at a young age to keep them that way. They look and sound like Stepford Wives on the Prairie.
They're not much different from domestic violence victims who

never leave their abusers.
But while feminists will defend battered women every time, they have been strangely silent since Texas child welfare agents first yanked 460 children from their mothers.
I don't expect feminists to defend prostitution, pornography or the latest round of YouTube junior high catfights. So I'm not really surprised advocates for women's rights are reluctant to defend polygamy - certainly not the patriarchs and their complicitous wives, who teach their daughters to sweetly obey.
In my mind, a feminist defends every other woman's right to choose, no matter how repugnant the choice - posing for Playboy, sleeping with New York's governor for money or joining the WWF. At the very least, I hoped feminists would defend the FLDS women's right to keep their children while the state investigated.
But polygamy leaves feminists conflicted.
During Utah's fight for statehood, the feminists of the day were split. Mormon women were among the first in the nation to vote, but the federal government yanked the right, condescendingly assuming polygamous wives were casting their ballots as proxies for their husbands. Some suffragists defended the women's right to vote; others supported the government.
University of Maryland law professor Martha Ertman says there are as many feminist reactions to polygamy as there are women. Right now, with this particular sect, many feminists are resorting to stereotype.
Most follow Allred's lead, outraged about Jeff's reported abuse of women and children.
But others flip theory on its head. They point out that some polygamous wives find the lifestyle empowering. Polygamy may in fact be the perfect relationship for a heterosexual feminist.
"I see how some women can access ironic ascendancy in their polygynous lifestyle. Mormon fundamentalist women have an informal power that many of us do not see or understand," says Janet Bennion, a Lyndon State College anthropology professor who studied Utah's Apostolic United Brethren.
"They manipulate their husbands to make decisions that work to their advantage," Bennion adds. "They manage the budget and rotation schedule. They form a strong female networking bond to acquire resources and take care of their children."
They sound a lot like the three wives of Bill Paxton's character in "Big Love."
"We should be suspicious of knee-jerk responses that assume monogamous marriage is so perfect and polygamous marriage is so terrible," says Ertman, who interviewed polygamous wives as a University of Utah law professor. "There's a lot of hierarchy within monogamous marriage as well."
In the end, the job of defending the rights of Yearning For Zion's mothers was left to two workaday Legal Aid attorneys - Julie Balovich and Amanda Chisholm. The appeals court justices ruled that Texas Child Protective Services (CPS) had "simply no evidence" of imminent abuse, certainly not enough to remove all the children at once.
"I just pulled over on the road to Eldorado and started crying," Balovich said.
Predictably, CPS has appealed to the state Supreme Court, trying to keep the children from their mothers indefinitely.
Feminists, now is your chance to speak up.

It will be a cold day in hell before the feminist lift a finger to help the FLDS women, seeing as how it is the feminists more than anyone else who wish to deny these women the option to live how they want to live.

Do you accept without question the interviews with "ex-homosexuals" explaining from experience how bad the "homosexual lifestyle" is? (I have heard similar stories from ex-catholics-- and even similar testimonies from recent converts to Christianity about their ex-sinful life.)

A little skepticism is a good thing... especially for those of you who want to see things in such unquestioning, right-and-wrong terms.

would you also be sceptical about what some of the young catholic boys said they experienced by priests of the boston diocese ?
(you probably know that those were not the only cases where children and teens were sexually abused by priests. we have - unfortunately - also had a share of those problems here in canada. perhaps those priests should also have been given the "benefit of the doubt" ).

i have seen a number of interviews over the years with different former members of mormon splinter groups - both men and women by the way - from both the U.S. and canada.
even though these people were interviewed over a period of years, their stories were remarkably similar.

as dlowan already said, grown-ups having a free will can practice whatever living arrangements suit them.
i don't have a problem with that.
when it comes to children and teens, i am of a slightly different opinion.

Are FLDS sect's beliefs sufficient grounds for taking the kids?
(By Faye Bowers, The Christian Science Monitor, May 27, 2008)

Are the beliefs of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS), the polygamous sect that the state of Texas has also accused of child abuse, sufficient grounds for removing all the children from the group's compound in Eldorado, Texas?

The answer now lies in the hands of the Texas Supreme Court, and how it rules will help resolve a major church-state clash that began when Texas officials last month took some 460 minors from the sect's Yearning for Zion ranch after receiving phone calls from an alleged underage spouse complaining of physical abuse. That complaint, it turns out, was almost certainly a hoax - the first in a series of bad news for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS).

It also now appears that evidence about the sect's belief system that the state collected during the raid - and presented to a district court to justify its temporary removal of the children - is probably flawed. In the DFPS's biggest setback so far, a Texas appeals court on May 22 overturned the district court's decision to keep the children in state custody temporarily.

"Existence of the FLDS belief system as described by the [DFPS] witnesses, by itself, does not put children of FLDS parents in physical danger," the ruling read. "It is the imposition of certain alleged tenets of that system on specific individuals that may put them in physical danger."

The state's Supreme Court is expected to rule this week on DFPS's petition for emergency relief from the appeals court decision, possibly as early as Tuesday. If the appeals court decision stands, most of the children will be returned to their parents at the sect's ranch.

"If I had been advising the [DFPS officials] in their suit, I would have said, 'Don't even think of asking about their beliefs,' " says Marci Hamilton, an expert on church-state issues at the Cardozo School of Law in New York. "Ask about their conduct and intent to act. They don't have to abuse a child to be guilty of a felony if they have the intent. There should have been more focus on conduct."

The appeals court decision, in fact, was a stiff rebuke to the DFPS and the district judge who allowed the state to take custody of the FLDS children. Not only did it say the "pervasive belief system" of the FLDS sect did not endanger all the children, it also found that the removal of the children and their subsequent placement in foster care were not warranted.

Even if the high court were to side with the appeals court, that would not end the state's investigation into child-abuse allegations based on specific evidence, such as the finding that at least five underage young women are "spiritually married" to older men and have either given birth or are pregnant. Nor will it hinder the state's criminal investigation, which is expected to result in felony charges against some of the men, and possibly women, in the sect.

DFPS officials insist they were legally compelled to remove all the children from the ranch, sparking the biggest child custody case in US history, because they found many underage women with babies or pregnant, because FLDS members they interviewed provided conflicting or erroneous information about family relationships, and because the "pervasive belief system" of the sect put all the children at the ranch in danger of either participating in or becoming victims of sexual abuse.

FLDS members, however, who split with the mainstream Mormon church in the late 1800s after it officially banned polygamy, deny those claims. They've said that if there are abuses in individual families, those should be dealt with separately - not communally.

"From the very beginning of this case, I thought [the DFPS] should look at individuals and not try to treat every participant in this community as though they're all the same," says Rod Parker, a Salt Lake City attorney for the FLDS. "They're not all the same."

It's a typical practice in child-protection agencies to remove all children from a home where abuse is likely to have occurred, says Ellen Marrus, a family law expert at the University of Houston. (Her own view is that it makes more sense to remove the abuser and get help for the others.) "If this were a house in which several immigrant families were living and one of the children were being abused, would all of the children be removed? Absolutely."

Scott McCown, a retired district judge in Texas and director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin, says he finds some aspects of the appeals court decision disturbing.

"There was no mention of what the standard of proof is," says Mr. McCown. "What the [district] court had to find was sufficient evidence to satisfy an ordinary person of prudence and caution that there was a danger to these children. The court of appeals treated this more like a final trial when this was a temporary order."

He is uneasy, too, over the appeals court's inattention to evidence of "spiritual marriages" and their effect on children, given that polygamy is illegal in Texas.

Also expected this week are results of DNA testing on the adults at the compound, which the state ordered to establish family ties. And criminal charges are expected soon.

"I anticipate ultimately there will be some criminal charges pursued," says Allison Palmer, an assistant district attorney. "But we will only pursue those after a full, thorough investigation."

Texas standoff: Battle over FLDS kids gets rough
Officials say Jeffs photos show abuse; critics decry state's 'sleazy' tactics
By Brooke Adams
The Salt Lake Tribune
Article Last Updated: 05/25/2008 10:25:55 AM MDT

SAN ANGELO, Texas - Saddle up, because it ain't over yet.
The largest child-welfare case in United States history bucked participants and spectators every which way last week - and the wild ride will continue.
The first jolt may come anytime from the Texas Supreme Court, which worked through Saturday without deciding whether to stay an appeals court decision that sends some, if not all, of about 450 children from a polygamous sect back to their parents.
The children, taken from the YFZ Ranch near Eldorado, Texas, have spent seven weeks in state custody and are scattered in shelters throughout the state. The ranch is home to members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
The next jolt may come Tuesday. A court hearing that has already been jarring - state attorneys introduced photographs of sect leader Warren S. Jeffs giving a husbandly kiss to a 12-year-old girl he purportedly married in July 2006 - resumes.
By Thursday, the underpinnings of the state's case seemed to be buckling. Just eight mothers were left in a pool of 26 females the state believed to be 17 or younger. More were expected to be declared adults in coming status hearings. Not a single instance of physical abuse was introduced in the hearings, either. Still, five judges mechanically approved boilerplate service plans while rejecting any suggested modifications from parents' or children's attorneys.
Then came the decision of the Third Court of Appeals in Austin, Texas, which said 51st District Judge Barbara Walther abused her discretion in April by ordering hundreds of children to remain in custody without adequate evidence.
It was an uncommon reversal of a trial judge's decision. Scott Henson, who writes a blog on Texas criminal justice, said it came from a notably conservative court's "conservative wing."
A day later, the impact of the ruling played out in very different ways.
In San Antonio, a court hearing was canceled after the state agreed to return 12 children to three families temporarily while the legal gyrations take place.
In San Angelo, the state went to battle with the Jeffs photos.
The photos were entered as evidence in a 14-day custody hearing for an infant born May 12 to Louisa and Dan Jessop. The girl in the photo is Dan Jessop's sister. Attorneys for the state contend the photo is evidence that the couple lived in a household that supported underage marriage.
The photographs have left at least some attorneys for FLDS parents and children reeling. Lawyers interviewed by The Salt Lake Tribune on Saturday said they found the photos "disturbing."
But attorneys were unsettled, too, by the state's use of them now rather than at the original hearing in mid-April.
Where the photographs came from has not been explained. Nor is it clear how far the state will seek to extend their impact - a question of particular concern to attorneys for the multibranched Jeffs and Jessop families.
On Friday, state attorneys seemed to be making that connection by having Dan Jessop confirm names of about 45 siblings born to his father, Merrill Jessop.
But the photos caused legal experts such as Carl Tobias to raise the same question that has arisen with other prosecutorial moves in the case.
"Should one photo... serve as the basis for the state removing the 400-plus children?" said Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, and an expert in constitutional and court proceedings.
Which is the message from the Third Court of Appeals, said Richard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform in Virginia.
The photos are as "relevant as using a compromising photo of the parish priest to take the children of all the parishioners," he said in an e-mail to The Tribune, and are a "sleazy" attempt to shape public opinion.
"If it was aimed at any real court at all, it would be the Texas Supreme Court which is preparing to hear [state's Child Protective Services] appeal of a decision ordering many of the children returned to their homes," Wexler said.
Willie Jessop, an FLDS member and spokesman, traveled to San Antonio on Friday and, until Saturday, had never seen the photographs.
He said he doesn't know the girl or anything about her situation.
He accused the state of making a calculated, unethical move by using and publicly releasing the photos.
"If that was your daughter, would you want the court to leak it to the media?" he asked. "The state put those photographs out to insinuate there were marital relations that involved sexual intercourse, and that is not true."
The girl, now 13, is in state custody and, like other children, has received a physical exam.
Whatever her situation, it does not "give the state the right to take children away when it does not have anything to do with them," Willie Jessop said.
That argument has been made repeatedly by attorneys representing FLDS parents and children.
"There may be abuse going on. I don't think anyone has argued that's not the case," said Julie Balovich, an attorney with Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, one of the firms that won the appeals court decision. "The question is, can you remove these children this way under Texas law?"
For now, the photographs of Jeffs are being used in just one case - that of Louisa and Dan Jessop's son. The state's challenge is unchanged: It must show their infant is in urgent danger and there is no option but to keep him in state custody, separated from his father and siblings, ages 3 1/2 and 1 1/2.
Wexler said even if CPS' allegations are true, there are alternatives - requiring parents to live off the ranch, for instance - that protect the children "without amputating their mothers."

There is a big difference between your attitude toward Catholics and your attitude toward this group (although both of these groups have been tied to child sexual abuse).

- You are not saying that all Catholics are in favor of Child Abuse.
- You are not suggesting that Catholics should not be allowed to be parents.
- You have never suggested that Catholic women don't have free will.
- You have not suggested that authorities should break the law to prosecute allegations of sex abuse by Catholics.

It is the difference in how Catholics (a mainstream religion) are treated from this "fringe" group that is the problem.

Not always, for a long while catholics lived in special enclaves and sent their kids to special schools. Catholics did not mix very much. And while Catholics were often well hated I don't remember it ever suggested that they were not to be allowed to raise kids. Not being able to have kids is a death sentence for the gene lines and for the religion, Americans might want to go slowly in imposing capital punishment upon religions. Theirs might be next.

First, Why don't you credit adult women the rights or the ability to make decisions for themselves and their families (for this group, but not for Catholics)?

Yes the isolation of this group is a difference... but it does not mean they cease to be human beings, nor does it mean they lose their civil rights.

My position is that they should have investigated the reports of abuse. My issue is with the tragic, excessive way they chose to respond. The Texas Child Protective Services screwed up not by taking their responsibility to protect children seriously, but by refusing to accept that these were human beings.

They would have done a much better job at protecting the children had they acted reasonably without bigotry.

Both sides jockey Texas Supreme Court with sect case filings
(Staff Report, San Angelo Standard-Times, May 27, 2008)

Arguments continue to pile upon arguments in the polygamist sect's child custody case.

In a filing today, the state Child Protective Services agency argued in favor of maintaining custodial possession of the roughly 450 Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints children out of concern that the parents could take them out of state if the children are given back to their mothers.

CPS today filed its reply with the Texas Supreme Court in an attempt to further bolster its contention that the court should not allow a large number of the children taken into state custody in the early April raid on the Schleicher County ranch to be returned to their parents.

On May 22, the Third Court of Appeals in essence told the state it had 10 days to give back custody of the children of more than 40 mothers from the ranch. The ruling, handed down in response to a writ filed by attorneys for the mothers, was sufficiently broad to have encompassed all but a handful of the children the state had removed.

The state on May 23 filed with the Texas Supreme Court to have the appellate ruling stayed. Attorneys for the mothers filed a response the same day, and the state has now filed a reply to that response.

The high court has yet to speak on the issue.

The attorneys for the mothers contend that the state has presented no evidence of child abuse against their individual clients, and the appeals court agreed that the evidence presented to date fails to meet the legal threshold for immediate removal.

CPS, in asking the Supreme Court for a stay, argued in part that it could not be conclusively established which children belong to which parents. The mothers' attorneys replied that denying the stay would only have the effect of allowing the children to remain with their parents while the CPS investigation continues.

In its reply to that, however, CPS warned that returning the children could result in the parents fleeing the jurisdiction with them. The agency argues that allowing the appellate order to stand could harm the investigation in several ways, including the return of 124 children to their mothers "without any male sexual perpetrators being identified."

Activities continued in court today.

CPS on Tuesday's hearing
(Brooke Adams, Salt Lake City Tribune, May 28, 2008)

A cloak of silence that has surrounded the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services lifted briefly after a custody hearing for the 2-week-old infant of Louisa and Dan Jessop was put on hold.

The department has issued this statement:

''We are pleased that the baby shall remain in the state's care.

''Investigators have been able to go through more of the documents found at the ranch and that means CPS has even more evidence detailing family relationships, including marriages of underage girls. It is clearer than ever that children were at risk of sexual abuse at the ranch.

''We were prepared to present that evidence to the court [Tuesday]. We do not know if the parents or the FLDS agreed to a quick solution in this case in order to avoid the public disclosure of that evidence.''

Texas Supreme Court asks for responses by tomorrow morning
By Brooke Adams
The Salt Lake Tribune
SAN ANGELO, Texas -- The Texas Supreme Court has asked attorneys representing nearly three dozen mothers from a polygamous sect to answer the state's bid to overturn an order returning their children.
The supreme court was already considering the narrow issue of whether to stay the ruling, which was issued a week ago by the Third Court of Appeals. It found a trial judge improperly kept some 450 FLDS children in state custody.
Now, the supreme court is giving attorneys for Texas RioGrande Legal Aid (TRLA) a deadline of Thursday at 9 a.m. to respond to the state's broad appeal of that ruling.
The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services also filed a second petition Wednesday with the state supreme court seeking a stay and a ruling on an identical decision from the appeals court in favor of an additional three mothers.
The court gave Legal Aid of Northwest Texas until Thursday morning to file an answer to that petition.
The news may mean no decision will come this week on the state's appeal.
DFPS contends the Third Court of Appeals erred when it found evidence for keeping custody of all children from the YFZ Ranch was lacking and that 51st District Judge Barbara Walther abused her discretion in making that order.
The children, whose parents are members
of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, are currently in shelther facilities across Texas.
Earlier this week four sets of parents were allowed to join their children in temporary housing while the legal arguments play out.
Meanwhile, status hearings to review family service plans that list what parents must do to regain custody of their children are on hold.
The state says in court documents filed over the past week that it can not match children to their parents until it gets the results of DNA samples taken in April.
Janece Rolfe, a spokeswoman for the Texas Attorney General's office, said Wednesday the results are expected by the next of the week - next week at the latest.
Laboratory Corporation of America, based in North Carolina, is processing samples from about 500 people affiliated with the sect. Each test costs about $100, she said. The state is picking up the tab.
DFPS has said in court filings it does not know the identities of most children's parents. The DNA results will solve that mystery, it says.
TRLA attorneys call that argument a "red herring" because the state matched children and parents for status hearings that began May 19.
The firm, as well as parents' attorneys, say many FLDS members provided accurate names, dates of birth and documents supporting the information when first questioned by investigators after the April 3 raid on the YFZ Ranch in Eldorado.
Investigators said they found evidence of abuse at the ranch that justified removal of all children. They also said parents and children engaged in a "conspiracy of silence" that made it difficult to figure out family relationships.
Rolfe said the lab will provide reports linking children, mothers and fathers, if their samples were provided, to Walther. Reports also will be provided to attorneys for the state, parents and children, she said.

the women and children certainly are HUMAN BEINGS, but were often NOT treated as human beings by their leaders and husbands.

perhaps they did act excessively. however, i wonder what the public reaction would have been if the CPS would have dragged their feet and ignored the abuse ?
i remember how long it took for members of the catholic church to come forward and report the abuse - many were grown men and women before they had enough courage. even then, the catholic authorities played a game of DENY,DENY, DENY !
(remember how the priests were shuffled around to make identifucation more difficult ?)

They would have done a much better job at protecting the children had they acted reasonably without bigotry.

i have trouble seeing how "bigotry" was involved here - but am willing to admit that i do NOT know the whole story.

we might want to remember how long the sex abuse in the boston diocese went on before being exposed.
imo it just represented the "tip of the iceberg" - it went on in many other churches - the "residential" schools for aboriginal children in canada were one of the most prominent/worst places of sex abuse.

Nun Who Worked To Expose Sex Abuse Dies

BOSTON, May 20, 2008
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(AP) Sister Catherine Mulkerrin, who pressed Roman Catholic church leaders in Boston to warn parishioners about priests who had been accused of sexually abusing children, has died. She was 73.

Mulkerrin died Saturday at Bethany Health Care Center in Framingham after a 24-year battle with cancer, said Sister Joanne Gallagher, spokeswoman for her religious order, the Sisters of St. Joseph in Boston.

Mulkerrin "was a gentle, caring woman with a wonderful sense of humor which those who knew her saw manifested in many ways," the order said in a statement.

As assistant director of the Boston Archdiocesan Office for Victims of Abuse from 1992 to 1994, Mulkerrin received allegations of clergy abuse and dealt directly with victims. She once said she heard allegations against more than 100 priests during that period.

Many of her memos to supervisors were later released as part of lawsuits filed against the archdiocese by alleged victims.

"I know I sound like a broken record," according to a memo from Mulkerrin that was released in 2002, "but we need to put in church bulletins: `It has come to our attention a priest stationed here between 19XX and 19XX may have molested children - please contact...."'

She said archdiocese leaders ignored her repeated concerns that priests accused of sexual abuse were allowed to return to parish work without the kind of supervision she had recommended.

"I expressed concern, consternation. What are we thinking of? What are you thinking of?" Mulkerrin said in a deposition released April 8, 2003, about her conversations with Bishop John McCormack, who handled sexual abuse complaints involving priests as an aide to Cardinal Bernard Law, then head of the archdiocese. Law resigned in 2003; McCormack became bishop of New Hampshire in 1998.

She said in the deposition McCormack told her he was trying to address her concerns. He later said through a spokesman he was following policy but acknowledged making mistakes during his time in Boston.

"She really confronted the Archdiocese of Boston six years before the sexual abuse scandal broke out.... I think that she was incredibly brave to do that," said Sheila Boyle, 60, who received a settlement from the church after she was abused by a now-defrocked priest. "It took a tremendous amount of guts to do that at a time when no one really knew the breadth or scope of crisis was."

The clergy abuse scandal erupted in Boston in 2002. Pope Benedict XVI repeatedly addressed the issue on his U.S. visit in April. He also met privately with five victims and Law's successor as archbishop, Cardinal Sean O'Malley.

Mulkerrin became a nun in 1955, working as a teacher and college librarian. She served six years as president of her order in Boston, resigning after her cancer diagnosis in 1984. She later began working for the Boston Archdiocese.

Hamburger,

Your post has typical gender stereotypes of men as abusive controllers and women as powerless victims. This is part of Modern Western mythology that makes assumptions that only work in our cultures. In truth women have always had considerable responsibility for forming most cultures.

But perhaps that is just a side issue in this discussion.

These are simplistic stereotypes that I find both offensive and unsupportable.

I also object to the way you differentiate a boy and a girl who grow up in this religion. The boy (who evidently you think does have a choice and is responsible for his decision) is part of the community as a villain, while the girl (who evidently is not responsible for her decision) is a victim (of the boy who is in the exact same circumstance for the same reasons.

There is an inherent sexism in your reasoning.

i'm all for ALL PEOPLE making FREE decisions for themselves !
but i believe that many of the women on the ranch had been deprived of making THEIR OWN free decisions by their leaders and so-called "husbands
</quote>
The FLDS women submit to their husbands, they know that they submit, they say to anyone who ask that they submit because they want to. Texas says that teaching kids that submission is the best way to live is abuse, they also I think believe that women who believe in submission are not fit mothers. The women have not been deprived of making their own free decisions, they have voluntarily proxied their decision making to their husbands. In BDSM this is called "power exchange". If the state is allowed to outlaw the right to take part in power exchange relationship we are in for a mess of trouble, because many people do it and most of them will not ever stop doing it. I also add that if that is America's position then it might be time to outlaw Christianity, because until the bible is repealed Christians believe that women should submit to men, and men are to take care of their wives.

the women and children certainly are HUMAN BEINGS, but were often NOT treated as human beings by their leaders and husbands

The women think that they are treated as human beings, who the hell are you to dismiss their experience? I hope I can decide for you like you insist on deciding for them.

<quote>
perhaps they did act excessively. however, i wonder what the public reaction would have been if the CPS would have dragged their feet and ignored the abuse ?
i remember how long it took for members of the catholic church to come forward and report the abuse - many were grown men and women before they had enough courage. even then, the catholic authorities played a game of DENY,DENY, DENY !
(remember how the priests were shuffled around to make identifucation more difficult ?)

Nobody wants CPS to ignore what they consider abuse, we want CPS to follow the law and to understand that they as individuals don't get to decide. We are a democracy, the people decide and we have processes to work these questions out.

Today's New York Times prints a new report as the case moves on from the appelate court to the Texas Supreme Court. They cite all kinds of people on every aspect of the case -- parents, legal experts, child protection people -- and they all agree the State of Texas screwed up. This is remarkable because the Times is notorious for erring on the side of the he-said-she-said format when they report on controversial issues. The fact that this is an exception indicates to me that they couldn't find anyone reputable to defend what the state of Texas did.

<quote orig_author="Today's New York Times">
Many child-welfare experts across the nation, who have as a group watched the high-profile Texas case closely, say the raid on the polygamist ranch diverged sharply from the recommended practices both in Texas and elsewhere in the country.

They say a growing body of research supports the contention of the mothers that forceful removal can have both significant short-term and long-lasting harm, particularly for younger children. Some studies have found that the wide-ranging effects include anxiety, extreme distrust of strangers and, in the future, higher rates of teenage pregnancy and juvenile incarceration.

[...]

Some experts in Texas state law and procedure say the state not only violated minimum national standards, which are written into the Texas Family Code, but they also violated due process considerations. These were essentially the findings of the appeals court.

"They made no effort to keep the children there at the ranch," said Johana Scot, executive director of the Parent Guidance Center in Austin, which helps advocate for the rights of parents who have had their children taken into foster care.

"And even worse, they did not give the families individual hearings, which they are also required to do by the code," Ms. Scot said. "They've really botched this."

[...]

Steven D. Cohen, a senior associate at the Baltimore-based Annie E. Casey Foundation, a national child-advocacy organization, said that while he could not say whether Texas officials acted improperly in taking the children from their mothers, he did think that they had violated numerous standards of best practice widely used elsewhere.

"Breaking all of the ties to several parental figures and siblings, and taking them to a remote and unfamiliar place raises many red flags about trauma and its effect on children," Mr. Cohen said

Experts say younger children, who often do not have a sense of the passage of time, can be particularly hard hit by such separations. About 100 of the children removed from the sect were 2 years old or younger.

Shelly Greco, a court-appointed lawyer for a 14-month-old girl removed from the ranch, says the child had been up crying uncontrollably many nights because she was so abruptly weaned.

i happen to know a few churchgoing christian women of various denominations.
if i were to tell them that they should submit to their husbands, they'd bash me over the head good - and i'd deserve it !

perhaps you are stuck in the middle-ages when that may have been the rule - but even at that time not always - there were many powerful christian women throughout history that did not submit to their husbands.

perhaps hawkeye feels that christian women MUST submit to their husbands - no matter what. i haven't met any of them amongst our friends or in our neighbourhood - but i have lived for over 50 years
in ontario/canada and that is certainly not a good place to ask women to SUBMIT to their husbands. :wink:

ps i'll tell some of my christian men-friends that they should exercise their right to ask for their wives to submit to them - we'll all have a good laugh - or cry, as the case may be <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/> <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad"/>

That's because theologically liberal Christians, men or women, have stopped being Christians long ago. They're just in denial about it, falsely believing that a Christian is a desirable thing to be. But hawkeye is right: if you accept the Bible as the standard of what's Christian, Christians clearly have to be anti-emancipation. You'd also have to be pro-slavery too. Not to mention creationist.

I really do think hawkeye is closer to the truth than you are, hamburger. But keep in mind I'm an atheist -- so when I say that someone isn't a Christian, or has ceased to be one, I usually mean that as a compliment.

I can speak to this one from experience... when I was religious, my community (as many conservative Christian churches do) taught that women should submit to their husbands.

The thing is... the women in this community fully believed and taught this. All of them were there voluntarily (being adult women with all of the rights and legal protections of modern western society). Many of them were well-educated with professional jobs.

In our diverse free societies, there are a fair number of women who believe and choose to live this way. I know many people who live decent fulfilled lives.

Why do you think it is a good idea to deny women the ability to choose this lifestyle?

You are not paying attention. CPS with the sign-off of one overly emotional female judge acted illegally, in violation of the laws that the state has written. CPS was wrong for wanting to take an illegal action, the judge was wrong for allowing them to do it. It goes with out saying that a judge who gets it as wrong as this woman did, and thus allowed so many people to get hurt through her incompetence, should have her career ended as well. Civil servants must pay a price for violating the laws the peoples representatives have written, for hurting citizens through their bad acts.

CPS is the expert on child protection law, it is their job to know the statutes and the intent of the legislature better than everyone else. The judge should have known that the CPS "experts" were full of crap, but keep in mind we are dealing with a county judge, a backward thinly populated out in the middle of nowhere county at that.

from what i have read and heard - and NOT just in this case - at least some of the now grown women were sent by their families to these "ranches" as underage girls.
they were therefore hardly able to judge what the world around them would be like.
were ALL of them able to make an INFORMED decision when they submitted to their husbands ?
some of the women who spoke up stated that they were NOT able to make FREE AND INFORMED decisions at that young an age.

(i've stated before that i have NO problem with informed adults deciding to live in whatever lifestyle they want - in case anyone choose to overlook those comments).

claiming that ALL those women made free and informed decisions, comes close to claiming that the people of north-korea have chosen freely to live under their DEAR LEADER, since they are, of course, breathing and thinking human beings - just like you and i.

CPS getting a judge to sign an order removing your kids (if you have any) and a cop getting a judge to sign your arrest warrant is pretty much the same process. If you are going to let CPS get away with misleading a judge on the law and on the validity of the action that they want to take then you must allow the police to do the same thing. They will. That is why you should be pissed when CPS gets away with violating the process as they did here.

Court opinions are findings of fact. You don't need to understand the facts, the appellate court and Texas Supreme Court have already told you what the facts are, and why CPS was wrong. You have your head in the sand.

The law broken was the law that says that children can only be removed on emergency basis if an emergency exists. CPS claimed an emergency which did not exist, they removed the kids under false pretenses.

Supreme Courts have jurisdiction over lower courts, not over any administrative agency or the police. All court orders are thusly written. However, functionally Supreme Courts have much wider command of events, since we are a nation of laws and most institutions voluntarily follow the direction of the courts. The courts trust that the police and agencies such as CPS will follow the dictate of the courts, but the courts can not command such. For this reason, and only this reason, does the judgment not slam CPS. Those who know how American law works do however know that the courts comments are directed towards CPS as well as the lower courts.

Law professors said that if child-protection authorities wish to retain custody of some children -- such as teenage girls believed to be at the most risk of sexual abuse -- they must make their case child by child.

"Their failure to individualize the children, to look at the 4-year-old boy as being different than the 12-year-old girl, is the thing that both the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court weren't able to abide," said Charles G. Childress, a clinical law professor at the University of Texas

So the state was hoping, putting it out while the Supremes were deciding the case. Luckily the court was above emotional manipulation, they ruled based upon law.

As the FLDS points out this man in the picture is in jail for having sex with kids, and will be for a long while. Everybody understands that having sex with a girl under 16 will land the guy in a mess of trouble, the cult will not stand in the way of those individuals being handed over to the authorities. The picture says nothing factual, and points to no other crimes than those which have already be prosecuted. Yet again the idiots at CPS misjudged the situation, they are the ones who come off looking bad leaking it to the media.

FLDS raid appears to have backfired
As polygamist families from the Yearning for Zion Ranch await the return of their children, officials in Texas face the fallout after trying to crack down.
By Miguel Bustillo and Nicholas Riccardi, Los Angeles Times Staff Writers
May 31, 2008
ELDORADO, TEXAS -- As officials haggled Friday over how to return more than 400 children to their parents, it was becoming increasingly clear that Texas' audacious attempt to rein in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints had backfired -- and become a lesson in the difficulty of cracking down on the 10,000-member polygamist sect.

"If you want to make any change... it has to go case by case, one child at a time," said Ellen Marrus, co-director of the Center for Children, Law and Policy at the University of Houston. "It's going to be very slow."

The children, who have been in foster homes scattered around the state, were set to be reunited with their families beginning Monday. But the deal was complicated when a trial judge late Friday refused to approve it unless dozens of parents filed pledges not to leave Texas -- a process that could take several days.

Legal analysts said that reuniting the FLDS families would make it harder to prove any children were abused. "It's very hard to talk to a child about what's going on in a household," Marrus said, "when they're in that household."

Authorities raided the FLDS compound in April after receiving an anonymous phone call. Although they did not find the caller, who said she was a minor being sexually abused on the compound -- the call appears to have been a hoax -- officials said they discovered evidence that all of the children there were at risk.

But an appellate court last week found that child-welfare officials had overstepped their authority. The Texas Supreme Court agreed, and on Thursday ordered the children released.

Now, activists -- who long have complained that officials looked the other way while the sect practiced "divinely inspired" underage marriage -- are at a loss.

"Who's going to ever touch [the sect] again?" asked Flora Jessop, on the verge of tears Friday morning. She fled a polygamous marriage as a teen. "For something like this to happen, it kind of makes you wonder why you fight for stuff in this country."

State officials said they would seek to remove FLDS children from their parents' custody on an individual basis, as well as pursue possible cases of abuse.

"The child custody issues and other court proceedings do not impact the ongoing criminal investigation," said Jerry Strickland, a spokesman for the Texas attorney general's office. "The evidence collected from the polygamist compound and reviewed by investigators will dictate the direction of this investigation."

And Arizona authorities on Friday issued a warrant to collect DNA from the sect's spiritual leader, Warren Jeffs, who is being held for trial there on sexual-abuse charges. Jeffs is believed to have fathered a child with a 12-year-old girl at the ranch, according to an affidavit. He was convicted last year in Utah of forcing a 14-year-old girl to marry her adult cousin, and received a sentence of up to life in prison.

The Texas raid was not the first time that the government had moved against the sect and been disappointed by the results.

In 1953, Arizona authorities arrested the sect in its entirety -- then about 400 people -- in the hamlet of Short Creek on the Utah state line. They put the 236 children into foster care. Images of sobbing mothers sparked a backlash that contributed to the then-governor's loss in the next election.

Scarred by memories of that raid, officials in Utah and Arizona have preferred to prosecute individual abuse cases against FLDS members in their states.

On Friday, they warned that history may repeat itself.

"For 50 years, [the sect] used the Short Creek raid as reason to keep their people secretive and isolated," Utah Atty. Gen. Mark Shurtleff said in an interview. "We said that was not going to happen again. Well, it has happened again."

FLDS leaders, Shurtleff said, will probably cite the Texas raid "as a reason why they should not trust the government, and instead go to their [religious] leaders first" with complaints of sexual abuse.

The sect -- which broke away from the mainstream Mormon Church long ago -- built its Yearning for Zion Ranch four years ago just outside Eldorado, a dusty western Texas hamlet. Its members attracted attention from locals, who were unnerved by the sight of FLDS women in full-length prairie dresses coming and going at the walled compound.

Many here cheered the raids, but on Friday residents were fuming. "I absolutely don't agree with what they do," Curtis Phillips, 33, said of the FLDS as he worked the register at the town's feed and mercantile store. "But blowing in that ranch like cowboys and taking all those kids -- that was just stupid. That's why people like me don't trust the government."

Curtis Griffin, 45, owner of the local fuel depot, counts many FLDS members as customers. He blamed Sheriff David Doran, who is up for reelection, for mischaracterizing the entire sect as pedophiles.

"I said from the word go, if there's sex with underage girls, nail their butt," said Griffin. "But nail the right people. We're going to wind up with a $30-million bill here in this little county because these people didn't have their ducks in a row."

The town also was abuzz over an anticipated mass voter registration by the FLDS. Hours after the court first ruled against the state, two members of the sect walked into the county clerk's office and requested 300 voter registration forms, a potentially tide-turning number in a county with 1,800 voters.

Doran, who has been sheriff here for 12 years, downplayed that. "I'm not worried about it. The citizens have always stood behind me, and if the community feels this is an attempt to take over Schleicher County, I know they'll stand together. Once we begin impaneling some grand juries and the criminal case comes to light, we'll see the tide turn once again."

Texas agency under magnifying glass over raid on polygamist sectPublished Saturday May 31st, 2008

SAN ANGELO, Texas - For nearly two months, Texas child welfare officials had insisted conditions at a polygamist group's ranch were so abusive that none of its members should be allowed to keep their children.

Now, however, one of the of the largest custody cases in U.S. history is unravelling, and some are looking for what went wrong when the state raided the Yearning For Zion Ranch and removed more than 400 children.

Since the state Supreme Court ruled that the Texas Department of Child Protective Services overreached when it swept the children into foster care, agency officials have been unwilling to discuss the case, their strategy or what went wrong.

However, some close to the debacle say the operation was doomed from the start by a series of missteps.

First is the oddity of a religious sect the agency knew little about, exacerbating the inherent perils of balancing parents' rights and child safety. Then there were the abuse allegations, starting with a mysterious telephone call and echoed by disgruntled former members, seemingly accepted at face value.

And an ill-fated 1992 brush with another religious sect - which led to the fiery deaths of 21 children at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco - still lingers on the agency's collective conscience.

"It's difficult to know whether, in fact, they screwed it up," said Linda Spears, vice-president of the Child Welfare League of America, a national collection of nonprofits that aid abused and neglected children. "It's the 20/20 hindsight thing."

Folks in Schleicher County, a dusty patch near the middle of Texas, had been at least curious, if not suspicious, of members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a breakaway from the Mormon church whose members believe polygamy earns glorification in heaven.

Members of the group revered leader Warren Jeffs as a prophet. Since the start of the group's Texas ranch, he has been convicted in Utah as an accomplice to rape and is jail in Arizona awaiting trial on separate charges.

Sheriff David Doran cultivated a confidential informant to monitor the group's activities, and former FLDS members recounted abuse and forced marriages to anyone who would listen.

Investigators "listened to a lot of misinformation and allowed themselves to be kind of captivated by these anti-FLDS people," said FLDS spokesman Rod Parker.

When someone purporting to be a pregnant 16-year-old called a domestic abuse hot line claiming her middle-aged husband beat her, authorities went in with Child Protective Services workers on April 3. But the calls may have been a hoax.

"We had no choice but to treat those calls as credible. If we had not treated them as credible and something bad happened, people would be very upset," said Tela Mange, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Safety, which is still investigating possible sex abuse at the ranch in addition to the origin of the hotline calls.

Children and mothers were taken away from the ranch because CPS workers thought it would be better to interview them at a neutral location, something that wasn't done in the last high-profile brush the agency had with a religious sect, the Branch Davidians.

CPS workers were confused about names, ages, and relationships of the children and adults in the complicated group marriages of the FLDS. The agency said at the time it believed sect members were deliberately misleading investigators about the names, ages and parentage of the children.

Although caseworkers said when they took custody of all the children that the sect was forcing underage girls into marriage and sex and training boys to be adult perpetrators, only a few dozen of the children swept into custody turned out to be teenage girls, and only a handful had children or were pregnant. Of 31 mothers CPS said were minors, at least half turned out to be adults.

David Schenck, a lawyer for some of the mothers, said CPS workers were confronted with a decision when they arrived at the ranch: identify all the men who might be suspected abusers or grab all the children.

"They were interested in taking care of kids, but the problem is they took on more than the evidence is going to support," he said.

Parker called the agency "heavy-handed." A state appeals court essentially agreed, saying the state failed to show that any more than five of the teenage girls were being sexually abused, and had offered no evidence of sexual or physical abuse against the other children. The Texas Supreme Court agreed in a ruling issued Thursday.

Spears, a caseworker-turned-advocate, said that despite the high-profile nature of the FLDS case, the dilemma faced by CPS is little different than in most removal cases.

"At the time you walk in, you have very little information even in the best cases," she said, noting the snap risk assessments caseworkers are often asked to make.

The second-guessing, too, is typical. CPS also was criticized for its handling of the Branch Davidians cult at its ranch compound outside Waco. Allegations of abuse at the Waco ranch had swirled for years, but interviews with children at the compound produced no outcry of abuse and CPS closed its investigation in 1992.

A year later, federal agents raided the fortified compound in a weapons investigation. Fire broke out and the 21 children died.

Spears said agencies worry about making wrong calls and seeing harm come to children. Decision-making often swings in reaction to criticism of previous cases or child deaths.

"It swings back and forth," she said. "There's no exact science being practised here."

Abuse calls from 'Sarah' convinced others that 'she has lived this'
By Lisa Rosetta
The Salt Lake Tribune
Article Last Updated: 05/31/2008 02:58:44 PM MDT

Police link years of calls to SwintonWoman linked to calls that triggered FLDS raid claims life of abusePosted: 2:57 PM- Sarah Barlow's tearful pleas were convincing: She was a desperate, pregnant 16-year-old mother in need of rescue.
Her calls to a battered women's shelter in Snohomish County, Wash., began on March 22. She started calling the NewBridge Family Shelter in San Angelo, Texas, on March 29. Anti-polygamy activist Flora Jessop in Phoenix says she received her first call from Sarah the next day.
Sarah's pain and the details she offered had the shelter workers and Jessop certain her story was legitimate.
"She has lived [through this kind of abuse]," Jessop says. "I believe she has lived this."
On April 3, Texas Rangers entered the YFZ Ranch in Eldorado, where Sarah claimed her polygamous husband was physically and sexually abusing her. Their unsuccessful search for Sarah triggered the massive raid that swept more than 450 children from the ranch - home to members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints - into state custody.
The FLDS assert authorities knew before the raid that Sarah's calls to the San Angelo shelter had been made with a cell phone registered in the area of Colorado Springs, Colo.
Had police traced the owner first, the sect argues, they would have linked the phone to Rozita Swinton, a Colorado woman with a history of hoax calls.

Police eventually made the connection, court documents show, discovering the two shelters and Jessop got calls from Sarah via the same phone - one registered to Courtney Swinton, the name of Rozita's younger brother.
But in the meantime, Sarah kept calling.
"Taking all our kids!"
On the day of the raid, Jessop got another call from the voice she had come to recognize as Sarah. But the caller now said she was Laura, Sarah's twin sister. Sarah's sister wives were holding her 8-month-old baby girl, Claire, hostage on the YFZ Ranch so she could not escape, Laura claimed.
Laura was angry, Jessop said, because authorities were supposed to meet Sarah at the gate of the ranch - not raid it.
"And she said, 'Can you hear my dad? He's on the phone, can you hear my dad?... He's yelling right now, he's yelling: they're taking all of our kids!"
Days later, Sarah told the Washington state shelter she was among the FLDS women and children in state custody in San Angelo. She explained she was using the cell phone of a Colorado cousin. And she dropped in small, accurate details, such as the name of a woman who worked at the San Angelo shelter, which had not been reported by news media, and a rainstorm that hit one night, according to a later Colorado arrest warrant request.
By April 10, the Washington shelter had called officers in Schleicher County, where the ranch is located. That day, a deputy was linked in to a call from Sarah and offered to help her leave the FLDS group in state custody. But when he pressed her to reveal herself, she declined or hung up.
The trail to Colorado
By April 13, Texas Rangers had talked to a Colorado Springs police officer who recognized one of the numbers Sarah used to call the San Angelo shelter as one connected to an earlier investigation.
The next day, a Colorado Springs detective told Texas Rangers about Swinton's history of false abuse reports. The Rangers responded they were headed to Colorado, the warrant request said.
On April 16, police searched Swinton's apartment and arrested her on suspicion of making an unrelated hoax call in Colorado. She posted bond later that day.
Despite reports about Swinton, child welfare officials said they still believed Sarah existed. A spokeswoman for the San Angelo shelter agreed: "She had so much information about what was going on at the compound."
The day after Swinton was released on bail, Jessop got a call from the familiar voice of Sarah. But the caller now said she was "Rose," a friend of Laura, Sarah's sister. But Jessop confronted her.
"I've been talking to you for two weeks now and I have a bunch of lies and tricks that you've played on me," Jessop says on a tape of their conversation, the last they had.
"It wasn't like that," Rose says, sobbing.
"Yeah, it was like that. You told me your name was Laura, her name was Sarah, and that [Sarah's husband] hurt you guys," Jessop said. "OK. That is a lie, a straight up lie. You got a bunch of people getting searched over a bunch of lies, honey. You've got to understand that's not all right."
"It's the truth," Rose said, nearly hysterical. "It's her story."

Woman linked to calls that triggered FLDS raid claims life of abuse

Police link years of calls to SwintonAbuse calls from 'Sarah' convinced others that 'she has lived this'Posted: 2:53 PM- The largest child custody case in U.S. history - discredited last week by the Texas Supreme Court - was prompted by soft-spoken Sarah Barlow's pleas for help.
That Sarah doesn't exist. But the caller may have been a woman who, like the fictitious girl, claims to have endured childhood sexual abuse.
Police have linked the calls that triggered the Yearning for Zion Ranch raid to Rozita Swinton, a 33-year-old Colorado Springs woman who they say has assumed at least nine different personalities since 2005, among them "April," "Dana," "Ericka" and "V."
All are girls who called for help claiming to have been sexually abused - by a father, an uncle or a husband, court records show. Rozita has explained the girls' presence to shelter workers by saying that they are there to "protect" her.
Rozita has worked full-time for an insurance company for seven years, attends community college part-time for general study courses, and is a practicing Mormon. She is her neighborhood's delegate to the state Democratic convention. And a person diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder who blanks out chunks of time and unplugs from the world around her - like she did the week of the April 3 raid, her roommate Becky Hoerth told Colorado Springs police.
Hoerth, who moved in with Swinton the day after the raid, described
Rozita as quiet, gripped by a mental state that is "not anything you can even break into." It wasn't until a week later that Rozita "started coming around," joining Hoerth for dinner and mountain biking, she said.
"Rozita just disconnects from everything," she told police.
Hoping to rescue Sarah, Texas authorities flowed onto the ranch, then decided to remove more than 450 children from its residents, members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The polygamous sect shares historical roots with the Mormon church, which has disavowed its former practice of polygamy.
A troubled childhood
Born in Nashville, Rozita was placed in Tennessee's foster care system at 14. She attended several high schools before graduating from Pearl-Cohn Magnet High School in 1992.
That year, the Tennessee Department of Human Services obtained a restraining order blocking her father, Clarence, from contacting her. Rozita had reported that her father had sexually abused her and she remained afraid of him, the state said.
After turning 19, Swinton lived with a Tennessee woman who was caring for foster children. "One of the counselors working with [Rozita] knew me and called to ask if I would take her in," the woman wrote in her book, After Disclosure, under the pen name Kate Rosemary.
Contacted by The Salt Lake Tribune, Rosemary declined to be interviewed, citing the safety of her current foster children. But in her book, she wrote Rozita, who also rejected interview requests, was "tragically abused" and had been diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.
The company that distributes Rosemary's books also publishes a Westview newspaper. With a recent article about Rozita, it included a photo of her during a trip to El Salvador.
It also quoted "a Nashville source very close" to her as saying Rozita "has flashbacks to a time when she was an abused child and teenager, and to times when she had been locked up and kept hostage."
But Rozita's father, Clarence Swinton, says the allegations of sexual abuse are untrue.
"When she brought this stuff up, she was in a... state institution, a reformatory for juveniles," he said. "She had run away from home and the state had custody of her.... I had no contact with her whatsoever."
"Negative and bitter"
Clarence met Rozita's mother during his 12-year stint in a Tennessee prison. He was convicted of first-degree murder in 1965 for shooting the owner of the Outlaw Grocery in Murfreesboro during a robbery.
The robbery was the last in a string of crimes committed by Clarence, then 25, and Robert Winchell, 22, both soldiers stationed at Fort Campbell. Clarence bought a bag of cookies in the store, left, and then returned and opened fire on a customer, who survived, and the store owner, who died three days later.
The pair was sentenced to 99 years, but in 1976 Swinton was granted a clemency hearing before the Board of Pardons and Parole. It recommended commuting his sentence with parole supervision for 15 years.
Clarence said his early parole was not connected to Tennessee Gov. Ray Blanton's cash-for-clemency scandal in the 1970s. "I was not in on that," he laughs. "I was not that blessed. I had nobody doing nothing for me."
He said he earned his way out of prison, first as a counselor among his fellow inmates, and later as a trusty.
It was during the first job that Clarence met Rozita's mother, who was a parole board clerk. As a trusty in the last three years of his sentence, Clarence worked outside the prison. It was then that the couple - who never married - had Rozita, then son Courtney. They stayed together until the children were 8 and 6. Rozita's mother had an older son from another relationship; he would later be gunned down in the Nashville projects.
A year after the couple split, Courtney left his mother to live with Clarence. Rozita, Clarence said, became "negative and bitter and she wanted to come, too."
A chronic runaway, Rozita eventually stayed in three different institutions for juveniles, he said. Her abuse allegations against him were "bald face lie," and state employees, knowing Rozita was not credible, never investigated him, he asserts.
Clarence said after Rozita moved to Colorado Springs - sometime between 1992 and 1996, after she briefly worked as a nanny in Utah - she called him to apologize for "all of the grief she started," he said. "She [said] she saw a movie that led her to do that."
"I didn't lie"
Colorado Springs police appear to have first investigated Rozita for false calls in June 2005 - after a desperate 16-year-old named Jessica told an adoption agency she wanted to abandon her newborn son and kill herself. The agency called police - who traced Jessica's phone number to Rozita.
"I didn't lie," she said during a videotaped interview with a detective, letting out a drawn-out sob. "I called you because I wanted you guys to help me," she explained, wringing her hands.
Rozita said she thought she had been asked to come to the police station to "do a report [on] her dad" - not to be questioned about making a false report and obstructing justice.
The detective walked out. Rozita's sobs intensified. "I just want my baby," she said in a barely audible voice. Rozita later admitted there was no baby to be concerned about, but claimed she bore a daughter by her abusive father.
Rozita was put on probation. But police say she continued to make a blizzard of calls, including one in February 2006 that prompted Colorado Springs police to conduct a door-to-door search for "Jennifer," a young girl claiming to be locked up in a basement.
Sarah Barlow started calling for help in late March, contacting shelters in Washington state and Texas, and anti-polygamy activist Flora Jessop in Phoenix. Convinced the she was abused and in danger at the YFZ Ranch, Texas authorities launched the raid.
As Sarah remained missing, police connected the cell phones used to make the calls to Rozita. On April 16, officers searched her apartment and asked her to come to the Colorado Springs Police Department. Around 10:30 p.m., she was placed under arrest in connection with a false call in Colorado.
Two hours later, a close friend posted her $20,000 bail.
"Person of interest"
Nearly two months later, two Texas appellate courts have said authorities did not have adequate evidence of abuse and the sect's children are headed home.
A spokeswoman for the Texas Rangers repeated Friday that Rozita remains a "person of interest" in connection with the YFZ Ranch calls as they await unspecified test results.
Charged in Colorado with one count of false reporting, Rozita is scheduled to appear in El Paso County District Court for a pre-trial conference Friday - the same day her brother Courtney appears in a Nashville court on charges of possessing and selling cocaine.

After raid, other polygamists fear they're next
Dennis Wagner
The Arizona Republic
Jun. 1, 2008 12:00 AM

CENTENNIAL PARK - Like many polygamous residents along the Arizona Strip, Marvin Dockstader is adding to his house, more than doubling its size to make room for wives and children.

He admits being nervous about the future.

Authorities in Texas rounded up members of a polygamous sect in April, taking custody of more than 400 children. The Senate majority leader called for federal agents to go after religious groups that practice plural marriages. And, just a mile from Centennial Park in Colorado City-Hildale, prosecutors from Utah and Arizona have been dogging a polygamist group for years. advertisement

While not a member of that sect, Dockstader feels pressure building as politicians talk of conducting anti-bigamy enforcement with Texas-style zeal.

"It's definitely headed that way," he said. "That could be us as easy as them."

But while Dockstader and others in this community of 2,000 harbor such fears, there are two reasons why law enforcement is unlikely to target them:

 They belong to a church, The Work of Jesus Christ, that publicly eschews child marriages - a practice that authorities alleged in moving against the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Colorado City and Eldorado, Texas.

 Polygamy law in Arizona is fuzzy. Arizona's Constitution bans polygamy but lists no punishment.

Arizona's criminal code makes bigamy a crime, but unlike in Utah and Texas, it does not outlaw plural cohabitation.

Because polygamists here are wedded spiritually, rather than with marriage licenses, they are not technically breaking the law. "Arizona's Constitution is very clear, but I can't prosecute based on the constitution," Attorney General Terry Goddard says. "I can only prosecute based on the laws passed by the Legislature."

Arizona's and Utah's enforcement campaigns against the FLDS sect involved other crimes, especially sexual conduct with children. Meanwhile, Goddard has maintained an open diplomacy with the more modern polygamist group in nearby Centennial Park.

A different sect

The Work of Jesus Christ split with the FLDS about 24 years ago in a leadership dispute. Neither is affiliated with the mainstream Mormon Church. Although members of the two fundamentalist groups are mostly kin, family ties are severed.

Folks here own a restaurant on Arizona 389, aptly named the Merry Wives Cafe. They wear contemporary clothes and mix with the outside world. They surf the Internet, watch Dr. Phil on TV and root for the Diamondbacks.

But they share the FLDS faith that men and women are married for eternity and that plural unions are a key to salvation. Some also share a chronic anxiety about being imprisoned for those beliefs. Several declined interviews, and others who gave them expressed those fears.

"The fear is that the law (or a constitutional clause) could be applied at any time," says Mary Batchelor of Salt Lake City, co-author of Voices in Harmony, a book featuring women's perspectives on polygamy. "They (prosecutors) want the law so they can use it when they want or at least hold it over our heads."

Dockstader, a 43-year-old building contractor, is among the few Centennial Park residents willing to be identified in a newspaper story. He won't reveal how many wives live in his house, saying only, "I have one civil marriage."

Like others in his church, Dockstader insists that the typical household in Centennial Park is a sanctuary of unselfish sharing and love, contradicting perceptions that plural marriage is about sex, enslavement or child abuse.

Watching some of his kids bounce on a trampoline in the backyard, Dockstader says recent enforcement efforts typify more than a century of persecution.

"Bigotry and all this animosity, it's really creeping up," he says. "It's hypocritical. America was created by people running from that."

Asked if he believes the attorneys general in Arizona and Utah when they promise not to prosecute polygamy, Dockstader shakes his head. "No. They're not in control."

Who is in control then?

"The mob," he says, referring to a public that hates polygamy.

Historical backdrop

Centennial Park's devotion to polygamy is rooted in Mormon Church founder Joseph Smith's revelation on plural marriage. That 1831 event eventually prompted political and legal battles.

Beginning in the 1860s, Congress adopted a series of federal laws criminalizing polygamy in U.S. territories. The crackdown forced Mormon believers into hiding or jail, erased voting rights and wiped out the church's finances.

In a landmark 1879 case known as Reynolds vs. United States, the Supreme Court upheld felony statutes against bigamy. Congress later passed the Edmunds Act and other laws designed to crush plural marriages. The campaign largely succeeded in 1890 when the main Mormon Church adopted a decree against polygamy. Arizona and Utah became states but only after agreeing to the special provision in their constitutions.

Not all Mormons embraced monogamy. Splinter sects maintained a doctrine of "celestial unions," and one such group moved to Short Creek, an isolated town where residents could dodge state laws by hopscotching from Arizona to Utah and back.

After years of sporadic enforcement, in 1953, more than 100 peace officers and National Guard soldiers descended on the community, taking children from parents. Twenty-three men were sentenced to probation for conspiracy, but public sentiment turned against authorities and destroyed the political career of Arizona Gov. Howard Pyle.

Over the next half century, Short Creek (now Colorado City and Hildale) was largely ignored by outsiders but suffered internal conflicts. A schism in the mid-1980s led to the rival sects.

Texas justice

When Texas authorities in April raided the FLDS' new refuge, the YFZ Ranch in Texas, they reported that 60 percent of the sect's teenage girls had babies or were pregnant.

CPS workers took custody of about 440 minors, claiming every child was in imminent danger because of a widespread practice of forcing underage girls to become brides. Last week, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the roundup was improper. The case has refueled a national debate on polygamy and the law. On one hand, government officials have a duty to prevent crime and protect endangered children. On the other, the U.S. Constitution and Supreme Court rulings guarantee religious freedom, privacy and due process.

Many critics of polygamy say the practice leads to a host of ills, including child sexual abuse, oppression of women and welfare fraud.

"Polygamy is inherently wrong and bad," says Flora Jessop, a Phoenix child-protection advocate who was raised in Colorado City. "There's emotional and psychological abuse that occurs no matter how you live it. You get a bunch of women, and it turns into catfights and abuse of each other's children because of jealousy.

"And the guys are corrupted by power.... They have the god syndrome."

In a recent paper on the psychological impact of polygamy, Larry Beall, clinical director at the Trauma Awareness &amp; Treatment Center in Utah, concluded that women and children are "profoundly impacted" by a subculture of paternalism, secrecy, abuse and isolation. Rates of anxiety, depression and low self-esteem are high among survivors of "polygamous cults," Beall wrote.

Centennial Park residents say the exact opposite is true in their community.

They claim to have well- adjusted families with higher education rates than the rest of the nation. They say homes with more wives and kids wind up with more love and greater responsibility. And they insist that anti-bigamy laws are promulgated by public fear based on ignorance.

Attorneys representing FLDS members also say that anti-polygamy prejudice has been used to twist the law.

Tucson lawyer Michael Piccarreta, who represents FLDS leader Warren Jeffs, says the government created a convoluted legal theory in prosecuting his client, who was convicted in Utah. The state charged him with "rape as an accomplice" for performing marriages between children and polygamous men.

"There's a huge state bias against this sect," Piccarreta says. "It appears they will use whatever method they can to stamp it out."

Utah's dilemma

In 2004, Goddard persuaded Arizona lawmakers to pass a statute criminalizing the conduct of a married adult who takes on a minor as a plural spouse via a religious union. He did not press for a law closing the Arizona loophole that insulates adult polygamists.

But Utah has just such a statute, broadly defining bigamy to include cohabitation with purported, multiple spouses. So polygamy is a felony. But Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff has generally ruled out prosecutions because he has an estimated 40,000 state residents living in plural-marriage families.

"The problem is, how do we put every single polygamist in jail, and then what do we do with tens of thousands of kids?" Shurtleff told CNN. "I don't have the resources to get involved in that. I want to focus on the most serious crimes being committed in the name of religion."

Earlier this month, Goddard and Shurtleff took part in a public meeting on plural marriages in St. George, Utah, the site of Warren Jeffs' trial. More than two dozen polygamists, most of them from Centennial Park, politely exchanged views with prosecutors.

But Dockstader says he remains worried and has considered resorting to an old Mormon tradition: migration to a refuge safe from anti-polygamy laws. "The thought occurs," he says. "But where is safe?"

SAN ANGELO, Texas (CNN) -- A polygamist sect under fire over allegations of underage marriage will now allow women to wed only when they are old enough to give consent under state law, a spokesman said Monday.

The legal age in Texas to marry without parental consent is 18.

"The church is clarifying its policy on marriage," said Willie Jessop, a spokesman for the Fundamental Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

He told reporters the church would advise FLDS families "neither request nor consent" to the marriage of underage girls, though he stopped short of saying the church ever violated the law.

"In the FLDS church, all marriages are consensual. The church insists on appropriate consent," he said.

The change in policy comes after a Texas judge issued an order Monday allowing parents of hundreds of children seized from a polygamist sect to begin picking up their kids.

With one exception, Judge Barbara Walther told the Department of Family and Protective Services to allow parents to pick up the 440 children starting 10 a.m. Monday.

Thirteen children and six mothers had left the Austin, Children's Shelter by 6 p.m., the shelter's executive director and CPS officials told CNN affiliate KXAN.

The exception involved a 16-year-old girl who the girl's attorney said was an "identified victim of sexual abuse."

The attorney said the child's release might cause her to come into contact with her alleged sexual abuser.

"The court has now signed an order applying to all children," the motion said. "But there are no restrictions or provisions which take into account the immediate risk of her alleged perpetrator having access."

The logistics of retrieving the remaining children may not be so simple, though, since some parents have children at different facilities across the state.

Under the judge's order, the Department of Family and Protective Services will still have the right to visit and interview the children.

These unannounced visits could entail medical, psychological and psychiatric examinations, and the parents must not intervene. Also under the order, the parents must attend and complete parenting classes. The families must remain in the state of Texas and notify the department within 48 hours of any trips more than 100 miles from their homes.

The ranch is run by the the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a Mormon offshoot that practices polygamy.

The FLDS is not affiliated with the mainstream Mormon church, which renounced polygamy more than a century ago.

The state of Texas maintained it removed the children because interviews at the ranch uncovered a "pervasive pattern" of sexual abuse through forced marriages between underage girls and older men. The state alleged that young boys on the ranch were groomed to be perpetrators because of those beliefs.

FLDS members deny any sexual abuse occurred and say they are being persecuted because of their religion.

In May, the 3rd District Court of Appeals ruled that officials erred in removing the children from the ranch, effectively overturning Walther's ruling that the children remain in state custody.

The state Supreme Court agreed with the appellate decision last week. See a timeline of the FLDS case »

DFPS spokeswoman Marleigh Meisner said her department supports Walther's order, which "allows for our investigation to continue."

"Our goal is always to try to reunite families," Meisner said. "We hope they can be safe there."

The children are being housed at seven facilities across the state, near Amarillo, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Abilene, Fort Worth and Corpus Christi.

"The kids have been terrorized and put in the custody of the state for weeks and weeks," FLDS spokesman Willie Jessop said Friday after a hearing to determine how to return the children.

"Every effort has been made to bring relief," Jessop said. "It doesn't need to be a problem to go pick up the kids. It doesn't need to be any more difficult than picking them up after school."

Also on Monday British Columbia's attorney general ordered an investigation into alleged misconduct at a Canadian community believed to be a polygamous sect with possible connections to FLDS.

Attorney General Wally Opal called for a special prosecutor to look into allegations of misconduct in the community in Bountiful, British Columbia.

Two earlier prosecutors concluded it would be difficult to pursue criminal charges, with one recently saying it would be unfair to do so, according to Opal's office.

No legal action followed the investigations because of questions about whether polygamy is illegal in Canada.

It was not clear if Bountiful's community had any connections to the FLDS or any other polygamous group in the United States

FLDS Kids Leave Midland
By Sarah Snyder
NewsWest 9

Seven of the 15 girls brought to the High Sky Children's Ranch in Midland are on their way back to Eldorado. The remaining 8 will leave Tuesday morning.

"They're very excited about coming home," Kathleen Jessop, a mother and FLDS member, said.

It's been a day of excitement for families of the FLDS compound.

"The girls all made special dresses and sang to our board of directors," Jackie Carter with High Sky Children's Ranch, said. "They have beautiful voices like angels, and they're very good at baking and cooking and gardening, and they played in the water, and we just had a really nice time with them."

Last week, the Texas Supreme Court ruled CPS overstepped it's authority in removing all the children from the ranch, and on Monday, they were able to go home. Kathleen Jessop has two daughters staying at High Sky. She said, "We're very thankful that CPS will give the children back. They're very excited about coming."

Parents began arriving around 11:00 Monday morning to sign paperwork. About an hour later, the girls came outside with their bags, and took group pictures with the High Sky staff.

"It's been a wonderful experience, a learning experience, and I think all of us here at High Sky learned quite a bit and a lot of insight, so I'm a little sad today," Carter said.

Kathleen Jessop says this experience will make FLDS members stronger.

"It's an experience that every mother in America should ask herself how she would feel to have to go through that experience then they would appreciate how we have felt," Jessop said.

Families separated by raid on sect are reunited

SAN ANGELO, Texas -- More than 400 children taken from a polygamist sect's ranch two months ago began returning to the arms of their tearful parents Monday, hours after a judge bowed to a state Supreme Court ruling that the seizure was not justified.

"It's just great day," said Nancy Dockstader, whose chin quivered and eyes filled with tears as she embraced her 9-year-old daughter, Amy, outside a foster-care center in Gonzales, about 65 miles east of San Antonio. "We're so grateful."

Her daughter and four other children were among the roughly 440 children ordered released after two months in state custody, much of it spent in foster care centers. Because siblings were separated at facilities hundreds of miles apart, it will probably take several days for all the families to be reunited.

On Monday, 129 children were returned to their parents. A church leader also committed that any future marriages would only involve sect members who were of legal age.

Judge Barbara Walther responded to a state Supreme Court ruling last week by signing an order that cleared the children to be released from foster care. Walther allowed parents to pick up their children, ending one of the nation's largest child-custody cases.

Dockstader and her husband, James, were headed to Corpus Christi and to Amarillo to pick up their other children. "We'll get the rest of them," said Dockstader, who was clad in a teal prairie dress and clinging to Amy, who wore a matching dress.

Walther's order requires the parents to stay in Texas, to attend parenting classes and to allow the children to be examined as part of any abuse investigation.

But it does not put restrictions on the children's fathers, require that the parents renounce polygamy or force them to leave the Yearning For Zion Ranch run by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

Late Monday, elder Willie Jessop said the church won't allow underage girls to marry. Jessop said the policy, which he called a clarification, will forbid any girl to marry who is not of legal consent age in the state where she lives.

"The church insists on appropriate consent, including that of the woman and the man, in all circumstances," he said, reading from a statement at the ranch in Eldorado. "The church will counsel families that they neither request nor consent to any underage marriages. This policy will apply churchwide."

Jessop said the church has been widely misunderstood and insisted marriages within the church have always been consensual.

He would not say whether marriages of underage minors had taken place in the past but said the sect as a whole should not be punished for the misdeeds of a few.

Child Protective Services removed all the children from the ranch after an April 3 raid prompted by calls to a domestic abuse hot line that purportedly came from a 16-year-old mother who was being abused by her middle-age husband. The calls are now being investigated as a hoax, but authorities contended all the children were at risk because church teachings pushed underage girls into marriage and sex.

The church has denied any children were abused, and members have said they are being persecuted for their religion, which believes polygamy brings glorification in heaven.

Marleigh Meisner, a spokeswoman for the child-protection agency, said authorities still have concerns about the children's safety, and the investigation into possible abuse would continue.

The Supreme Court on Thursday affirmed an appeals court ruling that reversed Walther's decision in April putting all children from the ranch into foster case.

The high court and the appeals court rejected the state's argument that all the children were in immediate danger from what it said was sexual abuse of teenage girls at the ranch.

The Third Court of Appeals ruled that the state failed to show that any more than five of the teenage girls were being sexually abused, and had offered no evidence of sexual or physical abuse against the other children.

Half the children sent to foster care were no older than 5.

All the children, including any underage mothers, will be allowed to go back to their parents, though it's possible some children's attorneys or child-protection officials could pursue further action in individual cases.

It's not clear how many might return to the ranch right away. Many of the parents have purchased or rented homes in Amarillo, San Antonio and other places around the state.

On Monday afternoon, no residents were seen out on the ranch grounds.

"Just about everyone with a vehicle wants to go see some little children," said Jessop, who said he wasn't sure when families might return to the 1,700-acre ranch with large houses, a school and gleaming temple.

Walther's order does not end a separate criminal investigation. Texas authorities last week collected DNA from jailed FLDS prophet Warren Jeffs as part of investigation into underage sex with girls, ages 12 to 15. He has been convicted in Utah as an accomplice to rape and is jail in Arizona awaiting trial on separate charges.

Jessop, who said the state violated sect members' constitutional rights, would not rule out possible civil litigation.

The FLDS is a breakaway sect of the Mormon church, which renounced polygamy more than a century ago.

Free at last: Courts end broad-brush injustice against FLDS children
Tribune Editorial
Article Last Updated: 06/02/2008 06:10:48 PM MDT

Two months after Texas officials raided a ranch and removed 468 children from their homes, a court, at the direction of the Texas Supreme Court, has ended this injustice, ordering that the children be reunited with their parents. Many of the children, whose parents belong to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, had been forced into foster care and scattered across the vast Lone Star State.
Two Texas appeals courts, including the state's Supreme Court, recognized that tearing these kids from their families was unwarranted without specific evidence of child abuse.
From the beginning, state Department of Family and Protective Services officials have argued that the culture of the polygamous FLDS sect is abusive, subjecting under-age girls to arranged marriages with older men and a lifetime of sexual servitude. They have argued that the culture raises girls to be victims of sexual abuse and raises young men to be abusers.
There may be truth in that. But under the law in the United States, a culture cannot be indicted. Only the specific people who commit specific crimes against specific victims can be. Thank goodness.
So far, the evidence that Texas officials have presented has not been convincing enough or particular enough to justify removing all of this community's children from their parents.
That is not to say that foster care may not be
warranted in certain instances. But that's the whole point. Officials must meet the burden of proof in individual cases.
Granted, that's sometimes a difficult proposition in secretive polygamous communities. But the standards of justice cannot be relaxed just because the practice of polygamy is distasteful or considered wrong by most Americans.
Judge Barbara Walther, who issued the original order in April granting the department temporary conservatorship of the children, was not lenient when she vacated that order. Under her latest order, the FLDS parents must not interfere with the state's ongoing investigation, must make their homes open for unannounced visits and their children available for interviews and examinations. They cannot remove their children from the state and must notify authorities if a child is to travel more than 100 miles.
But at least the children can return to their parents. If individual children should be removed from their parents' custody because of abuse, the state will have to meet the law's burden of proof. That's as it should be.

Special bond formed at children's shelter
6/3/2008 6:31 PM
By: Kendra Mendez

Paintings are the only things the children left behind.
What most of us know about the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints comes from the images we see on the news or what we read in the paper.

Gena VanOsselar and her co-workers at the Austin Children's Shelter got an experience most people will never get.

"There's no question that some bonds were formed; it was really hard to say goodbye," VanOsselar said.

Volunteers at the local shelter perhaps got the best glimpse into the lives many are curious about.

"We had read that they had a fear of technology, so we took down our computer lab, and the first night one of the mothers pulled out her iPod and asked where she could dock it," VanOsselar said. "It surprised us because we didn't expect them to be so technology savvy," she said.

Sixteen children and mothers spent about six weeks at the shelter where they slept in cribs lined in rows.

Kathleen Weager worked with many of the young children.

"They're such very gentle people, very gentle children and very focused," Weager said.

During their stay, with their mothers' permission, the children even got to experience some new things.

"The second week, I asked the mom if it would be okay if we did some painting and they said okay, and so I brought out some water colors and the children loved the water colors," Weager said.

The shelter brought in a pianist so the women and children could hold church services.
Their paintings are the only things they left behind. The shelter staff tried everything to help them feel as normal and as comfortable as they could, even brining in a pianist so they could hold their religious services.

They also learned that their diet is mostly organic, but they're no strangers to fast food. Workers said they loved Wendy's chicken sandwiches.

"Ultimately we all learned that what's important is what we have in common more than our differences," VanOsselaer said.

Even though their stay was short, VanOsselaer said it's the impact on both lives that's important never to forget:

"Anything that we read about them is now counter-balanced with our experience of coming to know them and forming a relationship with them."

How do FLDS know whom they're going to marry?
The Salt Lake Tribune
Article Last Updated: 06/09/2008 12:41:00 AM MDT

The FLDS do not court or date. Typically, a girl and/or her parents decide she is mature enough to marry and submit her name to the prophet.
That timing varies from family to family; some girls have said they believed they were ready for marriage before their parents did and vice versa.
The prophet arranges marriages, which are seen as inspired by God - although some members say they were asked by past church presidents if they had received their own inspiration about whom to marry. It is sign of faithfulness to accept a match made by the prophet.
Members say women may defer marriage or reject a match but social and religious pressure make that rare.
A marriage ceremony may occur within minutes or days of a match being made. Ceremonies are private, involving the couple, often their parents, high-ranking church leaders and the prophet.
The prophet may designate someone to conduct the ceremony.
The couple then "court," which may take days to months, before consummating the marriage.

Notice that the girl and/or the family decide when, not the cult leader. The leader picks the mate. It has always been known by the outside world that the girl can say no. The girls are pressured b custom and they at some point must follow the customs or else leave the cult, but they have always been free to leave.

Polygamous sect figure meets with Utah Attorney General reps
By Brooke Adams
The Salt Lake Tribune
Article Last Updated: 06/13/2008 11:43:27 AM MDT

In what may be a historic turning point, an FLDS church spokesman spent four hours Thursday with representatives of the Utah Attorney General's Office - a meeting both sides described as a small, first step toward more open communication.
Willie Jessop, spokesman for the polygamous sect, met with Kirk Torgensen, chief deputy, and several other staff members.
Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff, who traveled to Nevada on Wednesday to discuss the FLDS and other polygamy issues with counterparts from three states, did not attend the gathering. Jessop said he hopes for a future meeting with him.
"We've always seen him quick to the table when it's against the FLDS," Jessop said, who requested the meeting. "So our question is, what will Mark Shurtleff do?"
It was the first formal conversation between a representative of the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and the Attorney General's Office since Warren S. Jeffs took over as leader of the church in 2002.
"We hope this meeting will begin to open doors," Jessop said, who came alone because of "uncertainty about how we'd be treated."
Torgensen did not return a telephone call Thursday night. Paul Murphy, spokesman for the Attorney General's Office, did not attend but also said the meeting was a positive first step.
"There are a lot of bridges to be built," he said. "We've talked and now we discover whether we can trust what the other person has said."
The sect has historically been based in Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Ariz. It began building the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, in 2004.
The meeting covered a range of issues, most related to the removal of about 450 children from the YFZ Ranch in April.
Among topics discussed: a list created by the Washington County Sheriff's Office and shared with Texas officials, describing nearly two dozen FLDS members as potentially dangerous.
Jessop said he made a formal complaint to Torgensen about the profile list and asked for help setting the record straight about those named on it.
"We're the kind of people for whom an apology goes a long way," he said.
Jessop said he was asked whether FLDS would participate in the state's Safety Net Committee, which facilitates interaction between polygamous groups and government services. But "that's impossible when you've got profiling going on and you've got government officials trying to smear us," he said.
The FLDS have had only limited participation in the committee to date and Murphy challenged Jessop to increase the sect's presence in the group.
"If he feels people in his community are being unfairly treated, it is the perfect issue to bring up in the Safety Net," Murphy said.
Jessop said he also was asked about a marriage statement issued by the FLDS church 10 days ago, in which the sect pledged to not violate marriage age laws in any state where members reside. The Attorney General's Office wanted clarification on whether it would also abide by bigamy laws.
"We're hoping the FLDS church is going to stop underage marriages, which is the No. 1 issue we've had," Murphy said. The Attorney General's Office also has wanted clarification from Jessop about his role in representing the FLDS church. "We still need to hear who he is and how much authority he has to carry out whatever he says," Murphy said.
Jeffs has been sentenced to serve up to life in prison for his Utah convictions as an accomplice to rape, for a marriage he conducted. He is now in jail in Arizona, awaiting trial on similar charges.

The state of Texas expects to shell out four point five million dollars, to pay for the legal fees involved with the FLDS raid in April. Now, that amount will only cover one third of the total costs of the raid. The entire raid is estimated to top $14 million. Most of the money was spent on court proceedings after more than 400 children were taken from the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado. A state District Judge in San Angelo originally gave children protective services custody of the kids. However, Texas Supreme Court recently ruled to return the children back to their parents.

doing the math, just over $31,000 per "child" (some turned out to be as old as 26 years old) illegally detained. The costs are sure to go up as new charges are added. Texas tax dollars at work.

FLDS Update: CPS Workers Talk About Investigation
Reported by: Kristen Clark
Thursday, Jun 12, 2008 @07:46am CST

It's been a week now since more than 400 YFZ ranch children left foster care across the state to be returned to their parents who are members of the polygamist Fundamentalist Mormon Church.

Even though the children are no longer in state custody, for Child Protective Services workers in San Angelo the investigation into child abuse continues.

Because of the ongoing investigation - Supervisor Angie Voss could not comment on the specifics of the case, but she and other investigators say they still believe the original decision to remove the children from the YFZ ranch was the right one.

Angie Voss, CPS Supervisor, " A combination of things happened within the first two hours that caused me great concern for the children. I don't know how to describe it if you weren't there - the atmosphere and the feeling of it. It's not a place for children."

For the past two months CPS investigators in San Angelo have been sorting thru the massive amount of evidence- what was once a conference room has now been turned into a taskforce center. Dozens of computers help investigators compile the information.....Photos of various FLDS members are on the walls with notes about dates of birth and possible marriage dates.

Paul Dyer a Special Investigator with the department, says not being able to talk about the case is difficult.

Paul Dyer, Special Investigator, CPS," Thru investigation we know things that no one knows and we just wish they did and at some point they will, but it's hard...Beyond our large workroom where we are all working, fact is not known and then you have people that are giving opinion and there's a big difference between opinion and fact."

Since the first week in April when they first entered the ranch, investigators have been working late nights and long weekends. Tina Martinez says having the support of her family has made it easier for her to spend so much time on this case...

Tina Martinez, CPS Investigator, "My family knows I would not give up time with my children if I had an inkling that we weren't doing the right thing, and that there is so much that we need to do. They know I wouldn't give up that time with them."

Paul Dyer, "My immediate family and friends know that I wouldn't

be committed to this if it didn't warrant it. If it wasn't something real and something very important. Thru 27 years as a detective at the Police Department this has been the hardest investigation I've ever been involved in bar none."

State law required a hearing to be held 14 days from when investigators first went in.... but since it took 5 days to get all the children off the ranch, that left investigators with a little more than a week to interview and gather evidence on the more than 400 children.

Angie Voss, "I wish I could testify now to what I know now, because so much more has come to light that has validated everything that we thought. And one thing I do remember saying when I was on the stand is that I think we've hit the tip of the iceberg and I'm certain of that now."

Even though a court order allowed the children to return to the ranch....Voss insists the investigation has not ended...

Angie Voss, "We continue to find more information that makes us feel even more strongly about the cause and the initial call and the initial reasons that we went onto the ranch and we are still in here fighting."

Texas CPS employees....being found and affirmed that they acted illegally will never mute their righteousness. Charging the state $14 million plus for an illegal act....o'well, they mean well. It is all in a day's work.

Polygamy couture: Sect's clothing line selling well on Web
By Eric Wilson Published: July 3, 2008

Do we have to call it polygamy chic?

The polygamist sect that drew the world's attention in April when hundreds of children were seized in a raid at its Yearning for Zion ranch in Eldorado, Texas, has begun to sell children's versions of the conservative prairie dresses worn by its members through a Web site, fldsdress.com, creating something of a fashion sensation.

Maggie Jessop, a member of the sect, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told The Salt Lake Tribune this week that the community had been flooded with interest since it began selling online several children's styles, which adhere to the church's standards for clothing that is neat and comely but not costly.

"We have to make a living the same as everyone does," Jessop said.

Considering the uniform look of the church members who appeared in Texas courts to regain custody of their children, the site offers a surprising variety of children's styles - overalls, underwear, jeans, onesies and baby dresses sold with or without bloomers, available in pink, peach, yellow, green, blue, lavender and lilac.

Today in Americas
U.S. and Czech Republic sign agreement on missile shieldG-8 promises to halve emissions by 2050Obama proposes bankruptcy changes
A basic dress sells for $48.07 and a nightgown costs $31.81, but they recall the timeless quality and charitable notions of handmade crafts sold through 19th-century women's exchanges.

The venture may have come not a moment too soon. There has not been a soul in the fashion world who has not queasily wondered which designers will cite the women of the Yearning for Zion ranch as an inspiration for their next collections.

Designers have been tempted to mine cultures with an insensitive and not entirely comprehending eye in the past. For example, Donna Karan and Yves Saint Laurent have borrowed liberally from peoples Aboriginal to Maasai, and Jean Paul Gaultier once based a menswear collection on traditional Hasidic attire.

The Easter egg palette and box-pleat, huge princess-sleeve styles of the polygamist wives may still prove irresistible. But who does their hair?

Mothers in polygamous sect selling FLDS fashions online
182 commentsby Jaimee Rose - Jul. 2, 2008 12:00 AM
The Arizona Republic
Polygamy's pop-culture moment now extends to the closet. FLDS women are offering their handmade, old-fashioned children's clothing for sale online - long underwear, slips and all.

At FLDSDress.com, pastel-pink dresses and denim overalls mirror the clothing that intrigued the nation when authorities raided the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Texas in April, taking children into custody while investigating charges of underage marriage and child abuse.

There are $65 "teen princess" dresses that stretch from ankle to wrist, long pajamas and matching robes, all sewn by the mothers themselves, even some in Arizona's own polygamist enclave of Colorado City.

Sales of the clothing will help the Texas FLDS women pay rent and support their families. Now displaced from their homes at the ranch, most of them are still in the midst of a child-abuse investigation, and lawyers have advised them to establish their own households.

Mothers originally created the site so Texas officials could get FLDS-approved clothing for the children while they were in state custody. Turns out other people were interested, too.

"We're used to our clothing not being popular," said Maggie Jessop, 44, an FLDS member who helps coordinate the sewing efforts. "(But) we've had many, many people say that they would like to have their children be more modest and have expressed interest in our modest lifestyle."

"There were a lot of people that asked, 'Where can I purchase those clothes?' " said Cynthia Martinez, spokeswoman for Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, which represents 48 of the mothers.

Paul Murphy, spokesman for the Utah Attorney General's Office, finds the FLDS women's fashion offerings quite smart.

"It's very clever," he said. "With all the issues that are going on, most of the media attention has been about the way they dress and the way they wear their hair.

"I give them credit for going where the interest is."

FLDSDress.com has dispatched packages to California, Iowa, New York, Washington, and even Arizona, Maggie Jessop said, and not just the FLDS-heavy Colorado City area, either.

The FLDS wardrobe puzzled and captivated America as events unfolded in Texas. The poufed hairstyles, long dresses and buttoned-up shirts are mandated by jailed FLDS leader Warren Jeffs, who disallows patterned fabric and the color red. The FLDS members wear the clothing as a symbol of their faith.

The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is part of a group that split from the Mormon Church in 1890 over the practice of polygamy. Those who have fled the polygamist sect have long accused it of conducting underage marriages and other abuse.

Jeffs was convicted in September of being an accomplice to rape, charges stemming from his role in marrying a girl to her first cousin. In April, reports of pregnant teenagers and underage marriages sent Texas authorities swarming the YFZ Ranch. They pulled 449 children away from the arms of their parents, and mournful mothers appeared on morning talk shows, pleading for their children. Their efforts turned public sympathy in favor of the polygamists, and the FLDS capitalized on that with many fundraising Web sites.

Just three days after the children were separated from their mothers, Texas Gov. Rick Perry's office logged 449 comments that opposed the separation and just 32 in support, according to a report in the Salt Lake Tribune.

Polygamy itself is a hot talking topic across the nation these days. The HBO series Big Love provides a fictionalized version of life as a plural wife. Grey's Anatomy star Katherine Heigl is set to star in the movie version of former FLDS member Carolyn Jessop's memoir, Escape, and Carolyn is working on the script with screenwriters now. She fled the sect and her plural marriage in 2003. Her story about leaving Colorado City topped bestseller lists during the Texas raid.

Carolyn sewed costumes for Big Love, and since the Texas raids, has been approached by others who want such clothes to wear as costumes on Halloween.

"They even want me to help them comb a wig up (in the FLDS style), Carolyn said. "That's the other thing those guys ought to be doing, selling wigs with the face frame (hairstyle) already done."

The FLDS women don't mind if their wardrobe inspires a Halloween trend.

"If some people want to act weird, that's their problem, not ours," Maggie said. And a beauty lesson could be arranged, she added.

FLDS women have a long history behind the sewing machine. For years, they staffed a clothing factory in Colorado City and sewed things like uniforms in addition to handcrafting all the clothing worn by their families.

Clothing sold on their Web site is cut out at the sewing factory on the ranch in Texas and then sent in pieces to the mothers across the state for completion.

Carolyn Jessop applauds the women for finding a way to support themselves and tiptoe toward independence.

"When 100 percent of their (financial) support is coming from the (FLDS) church, that makes them 100 percent dependent on the church," she said. "If they realize they have a skill that is marketable... they might realize they could do it outside of the church."

Familiar with FLDS financial practices, Carolyn is concerned that the funds the women earn with their clothing sales won't end up in the mothers' pockets.

According to an FLDS spokesman, the women are paid per item sewn, and if they draw in more revenue than is needed to cover expenses, it is shared with other families.

"If people who purchase (the clothing) would at least request that they make the check out to the woman who made the garment," Carolyn said, "then this could be a really positive

Sure, let's throw some Carolyn Jessop quotes into the story so that she can pitch her book and heap some more slander upon the FLDS women. According to her, they don't believe what they say they believe, all they need is a little wake-up in the form of realizing (because they obviously don't know) that they have skills plus a check in their name. Who knew??

It remains to be seen if they are going after individuals who abused individual girls, or if they are still trying to fight a culture war. The FLDS has a good legal team, the state will need to prove cases to get convictions. Finding people will be only the first of many problems. They never did find out who made the calls. which does not inspire confidence in their abilities. Neither does the raid, the snatching of the children, the leaks, the lies...

AUSTIN - Five indicted men from a polygamist sect in West Texas have surrendered to authorities, Attorney General Greg Abbott announced today.

The five were among six sect members indicted last week by a grand jury in the West Texas town of Eldorado with offenses relating to the sect's practice of marrying minor girls to adult men.

Four of the men and Warren Jeffs, leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, who also was indicted, were charged with felony sexual assault of a child.

Another man was charged with failing to report child abuse.

Previously, only Jeffs, who is jailed in Arizona awaiting trial on similar charges, had been identified by the attorney general's office.

Jeffs was convicted of similar offenses in Utah last year.

Abbott said the investigation is continuing and could result in additional charges.

The Texas criminal charges followed a three-month investigation that began with Texas Child Protective Services raiding the group's West Texas ranch in April to remove more than 400 children because of suspected child abuse.

The children eventually were returned to their parents following a Texas Supreme Court ruling, but they remain under court protection and monitoring by the state.

Even if they are not all convicted, hopefully the knowledge that they cannot simply fuck whomever they please, while hiding behind the laissez faire legal attitude to their polygamy, and ridiculous arguments that sexual abuse isn't sexual abuse when it is done by religious nuts, (but is "freedom of religion" <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes"/> ) will give some rein to the abuse.

Can we get a definition please?? Maybe it plays into the self justification by Texas authorities for their heavy handed and illegal (aka abusive) actions towards the individuals in this case.

Overzealous prosecutors are likely to always be with us, and to be a problem everywhere, not just in Texas. Otherwise, although they may not be "good guys," they are far and away the lesser of the evils in this witches brew of bizarre sexual predilections and pathetic religious self-justification. A little research online about Warren Jeffs could go a long way to give the background to this whole brouhaha.

as usual, you don't know what you are talking about. Utah has no intention of prosecuting polygamy and Arizona is unlikely to do so. Both states have taken the stance that it is better to use means other than the legal system to deal with child sex abuse with-in the FLDS. Also, most FLDS members are still Utah and Arizona, they did not all go to Texas to escape prosecution or for any other reason.

It is also wrong to paint the FLDS as "his followers". Warren Jeffs has for several years been a controversial figure even with-in the FLDS. Jeff's did intend for YFZ to be the model FLDS community based upon his vision for what the FLDS should be, the families then went to Eldorado were picked by him in part because they were most willing to follow him in his challenge of societies right to make laws and enforce laws against marriage of girls under the age of Majority. There is no doubt that Texas has a right to enforce its laws, and the Jeffs and the families he put into YFZ challenged that. However, Texas reacted badly by going into persecution mode. The Jailing of Jeffs on its own would have gone far to getting the YFZ families to stop the marriage practices. It is pretty clear the the true aim of Texas is to convince the FLDS to abandon Texas, to chase them out of the state.

The United States Senate Judiciary Committee Holds Hearings on Polygamy Crimes: What Needs to Be Done at the Federal Level to Protect Children from Abuse and Neglect
(By MARCI HAMILTON, Findlaw.com, July 24, 2008)

The tide is turning in favor of protecting children in polygamous communities - as several new developments evidence. First, the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding hearings on the crimes that occur in polygamous communities today. I have submitted written testimony to the Committee regarding this matter, which is reproduced below.

A hearing that did not allow the voice to be heard of any current FLDS members or people sympathetic towards the FLDS. A hearing that was so openly not interested in arriving at the truth that it was largely taken as propaganda and thus ignored by the US media.

Actually, here is something I don't understand about these cases, which I'm too lazy to look up, and onto which you could perhaps shine some light. If the reason for rounding FDLS elders is that they have sex with minors, why isn't the dominant buzzword about Fundamentalist Mormons child abuse? Why is it polygamy?

To take the recent example in this thread, why is there a Senate hearing about "polygamy crimes", not "faith-based child abuse"? There are many cults whose powerful members abuse children, but who aren't polygamous. There are many polyamorous relations between consenting grown-ups, which would probably become group marriages if the legal system supported them. The case of the FDLS, fits much better into the former category than into the latter.

So why are the headlines in this case about polygamy? It seems so besides the point to me.

To me, it seems, the identifying feature of the groups, in the beginning, is polygamy. It becomes identified in the mind as the defining buzz word. The abuse of children is discovered after the group has been so labeled. (This is an unscientific response, just a thought).

I can see what you're getting at, but in some sense that just begs the question. Let me give you a counterexample to show what I mean. A few years ago, when the child abuse scandals by Catholic priests came up, would anybody in politics or the media have talked about "Catholicism crimes"? Of course not. Everybody knows that child abuse is one thing, and Catholicism another, generally benign thing. Nobody has trouble distinguishing. Why can't people distinguish polygamy, a benign marital arrangement that hurts noone in and of itself, from child abuse, which is one of the most serious crimes there is?

I don't claim to understand it either--and in fact, i agree that child abuse should be the theme. It is interesting that when authorities seek to prosecute these individuals, child abuse is the crime they go after. I suspect that prosecutors see the child abuse as the easiest crime which they can make stick, and from their point of view, the most dramatic way they can go after such a sect.

I confess that the attitudes of politicians are a mystery to me. I suspect, and don't claim that i know, that politicians feel they are playing to a morally conservative base when they trumpet the issue of polygamy. Thanks to the homosexual marriage issue, people of deep moral conviction (as they see it themselves--i am skeptical in that i think they are selectively, morally blind) feel that the institution of marriage is under attack. It could be that politicians think they have something they can run with by focusing on polygamy. It would be interesting to know if they've done focus group research on this.

Not sure.

Perhaps cos people used to be more excited by polygamy than by child abuse?

Also, they seem to be factually, if not logically, intertwined....since the people who get to choose the wives seem to fancy very small ones rawther often. They are not alone in this, but they are unusual in the west now for seeking to institutionalize it.

Actually, a lot of people HAVE called it variations of "Catholic abuse"....

For ages here I can recall arguing that it was not so much a feature of the Catholic church, but of people having a lot of access to kids combined with a lot of power, and that I suspected child abuse would be very common wherever those conditions were met.

I also suspct that the Mormon cult abuse is less a result of the faith, as such, and more of the licence it gives a group of men to have huge amounts of control over the minds and bodies of people they want to screw.

It is an example of a negative consequence associated with polygamy. Another negative consequence would be expelling teenage boys to preserve a certain ratio of men to women. The underage pregnancy problem is specifically related to the policies of Warren Jeffs.

Sounds plausible. Especially because by spinning it like that, they avoid having to talk about the darker side of religious faith as a facilitator of child abuse. Which, of course, would piss off much of the morally conservative base.

Thanks for posting that, Wandel. Hawkeye, the Rapist Boy, was stomping about claiming that i didn't know what the Hell i was talking about. He then supported exactly what i had alleged, that the Texas compound was founded by FLDS members who were adherents of Warren Jeffs. As the source you here present also confirms, polygamy as well as child abuse if a possible basis for charges against the membership. My comment was not that i knew for a fact that polygamy would be one of the charges brought, just that i thought it would be likely.

Under the terms of the FLDS, Warren Jeffs is the sole person with the power to perform marriages, and he can punish members by "reassigning" wives to other members. Furthermore, the "church" is held to own all property, all of the homes, in any area in which its members reside. To attempt to separate Jeffs from the FLDS as though there were a rational, separate membership which is not associated with Jeffs is simply bullshit.

A judge on Thursday gave a special fiduciary more authority over a polygamous community's trust, including the power to defend the fund against lawsuits and to collect money from residents to pay taxes on the group's property on the Arizona Strip.

Third District Judge Denise Lindberg granted the increased power to manage the assets of the United Effort Plan (UEP) to Bruce Wisan, who has warned of the possibility of property sales and evictions of residents in Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Ariz., if the trust is unable to cover an upcoming $1.2 million tax bill.

The judge also granted a request made by Wisan and the Utah and Arizona attorneys general to hold off on appointing new trustees to the UEP, an arm of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Lindberg agreed that she needed more information on nominees before deciding who and how many to appoint.

Who will control sect's $100 mil?The two dozen nominees have 20 days to provide more background information, including financial data and statements about why they want to serve as trustees (see box). Interested parties then will have time to file objections or statements of support for candidates.

A hearing is set for Oct. 25, when Lindberg could name three to nine trustees or forgo appointments and leave the trust's management to Wisan.

Lindberg took the matter under advisement after after hearing arguments from lawyers representing various candidates and interested parties. Many alleged that most candidates have a conflict of interest that would affect their work. In a report filed Tuesday, Wisan said most of them are viewed by the FLDS faithful as dissident, apostate or anti-polygamy crusaders.

The nominees range from anti-polygamy activists, including Flora Jessop, to Winston Blackmore, a Canadian formerly associated with the FLDS. One nomination is for the �dream team� of outgoing Dixie State College President Robert Huddleston, certified public accountant Gregory Kemp and physician Craig Booth; their lawyers argued they would provided neutral oversight.

Don Timpson, a nominee who is affiliated with the Centennial Park community near the twin cities, agreed with the judge's decision.

"I think she did exactly what she had to do," he said. "It's a big trust and it's better to do it right."

But Carl Holm Jr., a nominee who left Colorado City years ago, said the disclosure requirements are just a way "to eliminate a lot of people from the board of trustees. I don't know how they figure there are so many qualifications to represent the people down there. Somebody is going to get rich."

Wisan is being paid $205 an hour for his work. His accounting firm and his lawyers also are being paid at their standard rates.

Nearly all the land, homes and buildings in the twin cities are held in the UEP trust set up by the FLDS, which considers plural marriage a central tenet of the faith. About 8,000 followers in the community are considered at-will tenants by the church, which thought of improvements such as new construction and remodels as donations. In the past, the church sought cash donations from members to pay tax bills.

Wisan has valued the Hildale-Colorado City property at $91.6 million. The FLDS also has established outposts in Texas and Colorado.

Wisan was appointed on May 27 to inventory and protect UEP property after Utah and Arizona officials became alarmed by the FLDS' purported attempt to transfer two pieces of property without receiving any compensation for the trust.

Wisan filed suit in May to stop the transfers. His attorney, Jeffrey Shields, said Thursday he is close to finalizing a deal to sell the land, which could bring about $1.5 million to the trust.

Authorities also were alarmed by the failure of UEP trustees and FLDS President Warren Jeffs to defend against three lawsuits, two in state and one in federal court.

The defendants could lose by default, which means the plaintiffs could get damages that would deplete the trust and potentially cost residents their homes.

The trustees, including Jeffs, were stripped of their power in June. Jeffs, who also faces sex charges in Arizona, has not been seen publicly in the past year and a half and his whereabouts are unknown. He is wanted on state and federal warrants and there is a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.

<quote orig_author="edgarblythe">
SAN ANGELO — Four polygamist sect families are refusing to cooperate with Texas Child Protective Services and could lose their eight children a second time, according to court documents filed today.

The action, detailed in sworn statements from caseworkers, offers the first real peek inside the sexual abuse investigation that started March 28 with a purported phone call from inside the sect's West Texas ranch to a women's shelter in San Angelo. That call, now considered a hoax, sparked the largest child abuse investigation in the nation and locked the child welfare agency in a battle with the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the largest breakaway Mormon sect in the country.

On its face, the filing is no different that hundreds of others filed in Texas courts each year when parents retreat from the CPS bargaining table and refuse to cooperate. But it is the additional documents, including the caseworkers' own affidavits and children's diaries, that paint a picture of exactly what the state is up against in this case.

The FLDS does not control the trust legally or in any other way. With the cooperation of FLDS members the trust is looking towards selling off all or some of the property to individual members. The fact that the FLDS once held that all property must be owned by the church is ancient history, no longer relevant, and does not relate to current FLDS ideology on property ownership. The FLDS did not change their minds completely with their own free will, they were pushed, but yet again they have shown themselves to be open to change and to reason.

It would be a stretch to believe that harry Reid is capable of an original thought. He might want to not copy Shurtleff as the UEP has been controlled by the courts for a few years, and even with all of their efforts law enforcement agencies have not been able to prove much in the way of illegal activity with the UEP while the church controlled it. The conclusion is that the FLDS was largely incompetent of running the trust well, which is a different kettle of fish.

Second Texas official linked to FLDS raid steps down
By Brooke Adams
The Salt Lake Tribune
Article Last Updated: 07/11/2008 12:42:45 PM MDT

The director of the Texas Department of Public Safety announced today he will step down in August.
Col. Thomas A. Davis Jr. issued a one-sentence statement that read: "After 43 years and 9 months with the Texas Department of Public Safety, I am retiring on Aug. 31, 2008."
The Houston Chronicle connected Davis' departure to lack of confidence in the director following an arson fire at the historic Governor's Mansion in June. The building, which was undergoing renovations, was destroyed.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry and lawmakers had been critical of the department's management in a subsequent legislative hearing, the newspaper said.
Davis is the second Texas official to announce retirement plans in the past month. Carey Cockerell, director of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, announced June 26 he also will leave on Aug. 31.
The two state agencies oversaw the raid on the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado in April, which led to removal of some 440 children.
After two months in state custody, two Texas courts ruled the state lacked sufficient evidence to continue to keep them. They were returned to their parents, members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, in early June.
Criminal and child welfare investigations are

continuing in Texas.
Early estimates of the cost of the state action exceeded $14 million.

Texas officials want 8 sect kids back in custody
(By MICHELLE ROBERTS, Associated Press, August 18, 2008)

Lawyers for Texas child welfare authorities and the parents of eight children from a polygamist sect agreed Monday to try negotiating a settlement before beginning new custody hearings.

Child Protective Services had asked Texas District Judge Barbara Walther to return the children to foster care, alleging their mothers refused to ensure they didn't have contact with men accused of being involved in underage marriages.

Hearings on CPS' request involving the children, ranging in age from 5 to 17, had been set to begin Monday morning. The hearings were delayed so talks could be held.

"We continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children, which is why we have asked the judge to review the case," agency spokeswoman Marleigh Meisner said earlier.

None of the children currently live at the Yearning For Zion Ranch in Eldorado, where authorities swept roughly 440 children into foster care in April. Officials said at the time that the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which established the ranch, was forcing girls into underage marriages and grooming boys to be adult abusers.

Six weeks after the children were placed in foster care, the Texas Supreme Court forced CPS to return them to their parents, ruling that the agency presented evidence of no more than a handful of teenage girls being abused. Many of the children taken into CPS custody were infants and toddlers.

In the new CPS petitions seeking foster placement for the eight children, the agency detailed alleged underage marriages involving the children's fathers or stepfathers, though only one faces any criminal charges.

Rod Parker, a church spokesman, said that even though the families are getting individual hearings this time, the argument that they shouldn't be allowed to retain custody of their children remains unfair.

The issue, as it was in the earlier case, is "whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion," he said. "The substance of what they're doing here is fundamentally the same."

Parker also noted that the church issued a statement in June saying it would not bless underage marriages.

The FLDS church believes polygamy brings glory in heaven. It is a breakaway sect of the mainstream Mormon church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which officially renounced polygamy more than a century ago.

Sect leader Warren Jeffs and four followers were indicted in Texas last month for sexual assault of a child. One of the followers was also indicted for bigamy.

A sixth man, Dr. Lloyd Hammon Barlow, was indicted on three misdemeanor counts of failing to report child abuse. Authorities want custody of his two daughters, saying he didn't report the babies he delivered to underage girls and that he married a 16-year-old.

Jeffs, already convicted in Utah as an accomplice to rape, awaits trial in Arizona on charges of being an accomplice to sexual contact with a minor " all stemming from alleged underage marriages within the sect.

Utahns say fed help OK against polygamy
(By Brooke Adams, The Salt Lake Tribune, 08/25/2008)

A push for federal help prosecuting crimes within polygamous communities has the support of a majority of Utahns, a new poll shows.
"I don't know whether any of the individual states are doing a very good job of tackling it on their own," said Jared Esplin, 35, of South Jordan.
Esplin was among the 56 percent of Utahns in a recent survey who want the federal government to take a more active role in such prosecutions.
"I think young girls are being forced to marry older men and I think that is rape," Esplin said. "This seems to be crossing state lines and to be more than the states know what to do with."
Barbara Rowland, of Payson, agrees. "People cannot pick and choose which laws they want to abide by," she said. But the states "are not doing a very good job of it. You can go to any town in this state and find polygamists."
The poll was conducted Aug. 13-15 - three weeks after a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid called polygamous communities a "form of organized crime" and asked the federal government to "play a larger role in this fight."
The hearing focused specifically on the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which has been the target of state investigations in Utah, Arizona and Texas.
Majority support for greater federal involvement held steady across several demographic categories: gender, political party affiliation and religious affiliation.
But members of the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which first publicly disavowed polygamy 118 years ago, were more likely to oppose federal prosecution than "non-LDS" respondents.
The poll found 31 percent of LDS respondents oppose federal prosecution, compared with 19 percent of those identified as "non-LDS."
Steve Terry, 54, of Taylorsville, is LDS and joined those who don't want to see more federal involvement but said his view was not related to his faith.
"If [polygamists] are working hard, holding down jobs, as far as I'm concerned we ought to leave them alone," Terry said.
Any abuses that occur should be addressed locally, he said.
"The states and local governments are better able to understand those issues and separate out what really needs to be dealt with and what can be let go," Terry said.
Nearly a fifth of the respondents said they were unsure whether federal involvement was necessary. Jack Strosnider, 69, of Cedar City, fell in that camp.
"I don't agree with the practice of polygamy, but whether the federal government should go in..." said Strosnider, mentioning Waco and the Elian Gonzalez sagas. "I just get concerned about how much power the government [has]."
But officials in three states - Utah, Arizona and Texas, which is at the forefront of the largest ongoing investigation involving the FLDS - have asked for federal help.
"A comprehensive federal response should minimize - if not eliminate - the possibility that persons within the FLDS who may be predisposed to commit polygamy, or other crimes, will simply move their operations to another location," said Greg Abbott, attorney general of Texas, in July.
He also asked that federal laws be used to investigate crimes within the sect and more federal aid be provided for crime victims.
Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard told the committee he requested federal help in 2005 to investigate possible civil rights violations by the Marshal's Office in Colorado City, Ariz. The town and the adjoining community of Hildale, Utah, are the traditional home base of the FLDS.
"I am still waiting for a response to that request," Goddard said, who also asked for federal help analyzing hundreds of boxes of documents and data seized in Texas and at the arrest of sect leader Warren S. Jeffs.
Mason-Dixon Polling and Research Inc. of Washington polled 400 Utah residents for The Salt Lake Tribune. The survey's error margin is plus or minus 5 points.

SAN ANGELO, Texas " One by one, children taken into state protective custody during the raid on the Fundamentalist LDS Church's YFZ Ranch are being dropped from court oversight in the nation's largest child custody case.
On Friday, Texas Child Protective Services filed to have another child from the Utah-based polygamous sect officially nonsuited, ending court jurisdiction over their case. Friday's filing brings the number of cases nonsuited to 287.

Approximately 439 children were taken into state custody during the raid in early April, when CPS caseworkers and law enforcement responded to the YFZ Ranch on a phone call alleging abuse. The children were returned to their families two months later, when two Texas courts ruled the state acted improperly and the children were not in any imminent danger.

Only one girl, a 14-year-old believed to have been married to FLDS leader Warren Jeffs at age 12, has been ordered back into foster care after a judge ruled her mother was unable to protect her from abuse.

Six FLDS members, including Jeffs, were recently indicted by a grand jury on charges ranging from sexual assault to bigamy to failure to report child abuse

SAN ANGELO, Texas " Child Protective Services has revised the number of children it took into state protective custody following the raid on the Fundamentalist LDS Church's YFZ Ranch.
Texas CPS now believes it had 439 children in state custody, not 440 as the agency has reported for months.

"There isn't a simple explanation for that number changing by one child," Texas CPS spokesman Patrick Crimmins told the Deseret News on Friday. "It's been a very complicated case, it remains a complex case, and we think that number is 439 instead of 440."

The number of children from the Utah-based polygamous sect still involved in the nation's largest child custody case will continue to change rapidly as boxes filled with nonsuit filings continue to stack up in the court clerk's office here. As of Friday, CPS said it has filed to nonsuit 268 individuals, including the 26 "disputed minors" whom the agency initially believed to be children but were really adults. Approximately 197 children remain the subject of pending lawsuits.

Five months later they don't know how many kids they snatched because it is "a complicated case"? Bullshit, they don't know because the entire action was bungled by the state of Texas.

Prosecutors in Utah are beginning to get a glimpse of some of the massive amounts of evidence seized by law enforcement during the raid on the Fundamentalist LDS Church's YFZ Ranch in Texas.
But any hopes of building criminal cases may evaporate if lawyers for the polygamous sect succeed in getting the search warrants tossed.

"We're certainly interested, and we will follow up on that stuff," Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said in a recent interview with the Deseret News. "If we're not allowed to keep that evidence or use it in criminal prosecutions, then we're back to square one."

Among the hundreds of thousands of pieces of evidence seized from the Yearning For Zion Ranch's temple grounds were marriage records and dictations by FLDS leader Warren Jeffs.

Some of the evidence has become public since it was entered into court records in the separate child custody battle over children from the YFZ Ranch. Exhibits entered into a recent court case and obtained by the Deseret News show at least three underage marriages took place in the FLDS enclave of Hildale, Utah.

One of the Utah marriages, Texas child welfare authorities claim, took place in 2004 between FLDS leader Warren Jeffs and a girl who was only 13.

Texas lawyers for the FLDS Church recently renewed their challenge to the search warrants.
"Both warrants having now been returned (the FLDS Church) ask the court.... to conduct a hearing, take testimony and determine whether 'good ground' existed for these warrants and the searches conducted pursuant thereto, and to take measures to protect matters of privilege and privacy in the property seized," FLDS attorney Cynthia Orr wrote in a June motion renewing their challenge.

A judge in San Angelo has scheduled an Oct. 1 hearing on the matter. Lawyers for the church claim the search was illegal, having been based on a hoax phone call that launched the raid, and what was seized may fall under priest-penitent privilege

The Utah Supreme Court has reversed Warren Steed Jeffs' two convictions on charges of rape as an accomplice and ordered a new trial, saying that instructions given to jurors were erroneous
.
..
The defense has always maintained that marrying someone, encouraging them to make their marriage work and "be fruitful and multiply... that is not the same thing as saying to a husband, 'I'm encouraging you to rape your wife,' " Bugden said.

He said he had not had a chance to speak to Jeffs but planned to do so Tuesday afternoon.

Assistant Utah Attorney General Laura Dupaix told CNN affiliate KSTU that the opinion is "going to make it difficult, I think, for us to do future prosecutions in cases where some of these men in positions of power -- almost complete power, like Warren Jeffs is -- to prosecute them for forcing young girls into these marriages. I think that's really the part of this opinion that is most disappointing for us."

That the state invented law to get an unpopular person is no surprise at all, as the legal profession has become very slipshod and vengeful, but that the trial court got overturned is quite the shocker, at least to me.
